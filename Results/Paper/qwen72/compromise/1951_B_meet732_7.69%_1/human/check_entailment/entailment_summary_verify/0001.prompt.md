You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if k == 14:
        print(ind)
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of cows, where each rating is between 1 and 10^9. It returns an integer value based on the following cases:
1. If there are no cows with a rating greater than the cow at index `k`, the function returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
2. If there is exactly one cow with a rating greater than the cow at index `k` and its index is 0, the function returns `k - 1`.
3. If there is exactly one cow with a rating greater than the cow at index `k` and its index is greater than `k`, the function returns `ind[0] - 1`.
4. If there is exactly one cow with a rating greater than the cow at index `k` and its index is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
5. If there are exactly two cows with ratings greater than the cow at index `k` and the first cow's index is 0, the function returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
6. If there are exactly two cows with ratings greater than the cow at index `k` and `k` is greater than the second cow's index, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
7. If there are exactly two cows with ratings greater than the cow at index `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the second cow's index, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

The list `a` remains unchanged, and the value of `x` (the rating of the cow at index `k`) also remains unchanged. If `k` is 14, the function may print the list `ind` containing the indices of the first two cows with ratings greater than the cow at index 14.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is the index of the cow of interest.
   - It then reads the list of Cowdeforces ratings `l` for the cows.
   - The index `k` is adjusted by subtracting 1 to make it zero-based.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of ratings `a`.
   - It extracts the rating of the cow of interest `x` from the list `a` at index `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to count the number of such higher-rated cows.

3. **Finding Indices of Higher-Rated Cows:**
   - The program iterates through the list `a` and appends the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x` to `ind`.
   - It stops the iteration once it finds two such cows (i.e., `c == 2`).

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - If no higher-rated cows are found (`ind == []`), the cow of interest can win all matches except the last one, so the function returns `n - 1`.
   - If only one higher-rated cow is found (`len(ind) == 1`):
     - If this cow is at position 0, the cow of interest can win all matches up to its position, so the function returns `k - 1`.
     - If this cow is after the cow of interest (`ind[0] > k`), the cow of interest can win all matches up to the position of the higher-rated cow, so the function returns `ind[0] - 1`.
     - Otherwise, the cow of interest can win either all matches up to the position of the higher-rated cow or all matches up to the position of the higher-rated cow minus the position of the cow of interest, whichever is greater.
   - If two higher-rated cows are found:
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at position 0, the cow of interest can win all matches up to the position of the second higher-rated cow, so the function returns `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)`.
     - If the cow of interest is after the second higher-rated cow (`k > ind[1]`), the cow of interest can win either all matches up to the position of the first higher-rated cow or the difference between the positions of the first and second higher-rated cows, whichever is greater.
     - Otherwise, the cow of interest can win either all matches up to the position of the first higher-rated cow or the difference between the position of the cow of interest and the position of the first higher-rated cow, whichever is greater.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program includes a debug print statement for `k == 14`, which is not part of the problem's requirements and can be ignored for correctness evaluation.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program correctly identifies the maximum number of matches the cow of interest can win by considering the positions of the higher-rated cows and the optimal swap position. The logic handles all the specified cases and edge conditions as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
