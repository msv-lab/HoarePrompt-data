Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the length of the array `c` is greater than the length of the array `a`. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the length of `c` is always equal to the length of `a` when it calculates the differences. This can lead to incorrect results when `m > n`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10
```
The program will sort `a` as `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `c` as `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]`. It will then try to calculate the differences using the indices `i` and `j` in the loop, but it will only use the first `n` elements of `c` (i.e., `[10, 9, 8, 7]`). This can lead to suboptimal results because it does not consider the possibility of using the remaining elements of `c` to maximize the difference.

The correct approach should involve selecting the `n` largest elements from `c` and then pairing them with the elements of `a` in a way that maximizes the total difference. The program should handle this by ensuring that it always uses the `n` largest elements from `c` and not just the first `n` elements after sorting.
