Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two lists of integers, `a` and `c`, and their respective lengths `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of list `a` equal to the corresponding elements of list `c` by either increasing or decreasing the elements of `a` by 1. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged, but the internal state of the loop (i.e., `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`) is reset for each test case. **
