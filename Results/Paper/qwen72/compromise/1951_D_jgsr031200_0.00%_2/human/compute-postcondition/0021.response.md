The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function does not return any value in both cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 to 10^18 and does not return any value.**
