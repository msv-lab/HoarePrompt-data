Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
   - `costs` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
   - `h` is calculated as `k + (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1)`.
   - The current value of `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Calculate `h`:**
   - Given `n = 0`, the expression for `h` becomes:
     \[
     h = k + (0 - k + 1) // (0 - k + 1)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     0 - k + 1 = 1 - k
     \]
   - The expression now is:
     \[
     h = k + (1 - k) // (1 - k)
     \]
   - The division `(1 - k) // (1 - k)` is 1 (since any non-zero number divided by itself is 1):
     \[
     h = k + 1
     \]

3. **Check the condition:**
   - The initial state also mentions that the current value of `h` is less than `k`.
   - However, from the calculation, we have `h = k + 1`, which means `h` is actually greater than `k`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The condition `h < k` is false because `h = k + 1`.
   - The code snippet `print('NO')` will execute because the condition is false.

Output: **NO**
