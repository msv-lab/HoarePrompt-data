Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `h` is `k + (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1)`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `costs`, which contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- In the first iteration, `i` is `n - k + 1`. The value of `curr` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1)`, which is the largest integer `m` such that `m * (n - k + 1) <= n`. This `curr` is then added to `h`, and `n` is reduced by `curr * (n - k + 1)`.
- In the second iteration, `i` is `1`. The value of `curr` is calculated as `n // 1`, which is simply `n`. This `curr` is added to `h`, and `n` is reduced by `curr * 1`, effectively setting `n` to 0.
- After both iterations, `n` is 0, and `h` is the sum of the two `curr` values calculated in each iteration. The first `curr` value is `k + (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1)`, and the second `curr` value is the remaining `n` after the first iteration. Since the first iteration reduces `n` to a value less than `n - k + 1`, the second iteration simply adds this remaining value to `h` and sets `n` to 0.
