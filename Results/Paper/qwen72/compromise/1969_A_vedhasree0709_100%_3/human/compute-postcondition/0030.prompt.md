Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while i <= n - 1:
    p = l[i]
    q = l[p - 1]
    if q == i + 1:
        print(2)
        j = 1
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `p` is equal to the first element of `l`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 1), then `j` is set to 1, `q` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0 and `q` remains equal to the element in `l` at the index `p - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000) and `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 3, `p` is equal to the element in `l` at index 2, `j` remains 0 unless `q` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 4), in which case `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `q` is equal to the element in `l` at the index `p - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000) and `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 4, `p` is equal to the element in `l` at index 3, `q` is equal to the element in `l` at the index `p - 1`. If `q` is equal to 4, `j` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
