Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000) and `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 4, `p` is equal to the element in `l` at index 3, `q` is equal to the element in `l` at the index `p - 1`. If `q` is equal to 4, `j` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
