Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `p` is equal to the first element of `l`, `q` is equal to the element in `l` at the index `p - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` is assigned the value of the element in the list `l` at the index `p - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged.
- `p` is the first element of `l`, and `q` is set to the element in `l` at the index `p - 1`.
