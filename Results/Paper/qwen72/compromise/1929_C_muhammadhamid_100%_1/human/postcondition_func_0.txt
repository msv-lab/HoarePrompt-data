The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input. It then calculates a value `s` starting from 1 and iteratively updates `s` using the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value.
