Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins is flawed. The program attempts to calculate a threshold value `s` that Sasha needs to have to ensure he can always win more coins, but the calculation does not accurately reflect the rules of the casino and the strategy needed to ensure that Sasha can always win any number of coins.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Threshold Calculation**: The program calculates a threshold `s` by incrementing it in a loop. However, the way it increments `s` does not correctly model the strategy needed to ensure that Sasha can always win any number of coins. Specifically, the line `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not correctly simulate the effect of winning and losing bets under the given rules.

2. **Strategy Consideration**: The program does not consider the strategy that Sasha should use to place his bets. For example, if Sasha can only lose a maximum of `x` times in a row, he should place bets in a way that ensures he can recover from `x` consecutive losses. This involves placing bets that are small enough to allow recovery after `x` losses but large enough to make significant gains when he wins.

3. **Initial Coins Check**: The program checks if `a` (initial coins) is greater than or equal to `s` (calculated threshold). This check is not sufficient to determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins. The correct approach should involve a more sophisticated strategy to ensure that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still make progress towards his goal.

A correct approach would involve a more detailed strategy to place bets, ensuring that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee winning any number of coins
        min_coins_needed = (k - 1) * x + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= min_coins_needed else 'No')

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the minimum number of coins `min_coins_needed` that Sasha needs to have to ensure he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still make progress. The formula `(k - 1) * x + 1` ensures that Sasha can always place a bet that will allow him to recover and continue betting, regardless of the outcomes of the previous `x` bets.
