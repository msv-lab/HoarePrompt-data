The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `x` must still be greater than `i`, which means `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 1, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is 2 + 2 // (k - 1), `i` is 2, the user input must be greater than `x`, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input, `a` is the third integer from user input.**
