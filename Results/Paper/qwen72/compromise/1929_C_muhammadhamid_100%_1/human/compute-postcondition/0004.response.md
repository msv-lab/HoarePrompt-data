Output State: **`_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is 1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1)), `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Initially, `s` is 1.
- The expression `s // (k - 1)` depends on the value of `k`. However, since `s` is 1, `1 // (k - 1)` will be 0 for any integer `k` except when `k` is 1 (which would result in a division by zero error, but we assume `k` is not 1 for this calculation).
- Therefore, `s` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2.
- The values of `_`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
