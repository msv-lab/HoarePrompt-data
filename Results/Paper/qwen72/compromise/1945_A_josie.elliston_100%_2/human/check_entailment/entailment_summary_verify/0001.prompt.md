You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three non-negative integer parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It returns -1 if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must be alone in a tent.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in any type of tent configuration.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be paired with universals to form a tent of 3 people.
   - If the remaining extroverts plus the number of universals is less than 3, it is impossible to form a valid tent, and the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by combining the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts (each needing their own tent) and the number of tents calculated by `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts, the number of tents needed is exactly the number of introverts.
   - **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts, the number of tents needed is `ceil(extroverts / 3)`.
   - **All Universals:** If there are only universals, the number of tents needed is `ceil(universals / 3)`.
   - **Mixed Cases:** The function should handle cases where there are a mix of introverts, extroverts, and universals, ensuring that extroverts are always in tents of 3 people.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 2 (need 1 more person to form a tent of 3)
     - Universals: 3 (1 universal can join the 2 extroverts, and the remaining 2 universals can form another tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Example 2:** `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (need 2 more people to form 2 tents of 3)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a valid tent with extroverts)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible to accommodate)
   - **Example 3:** `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (need 2 more people to form 2 tents of 3)
     - Universals: 2 (enough to form a valid tent with extroverts)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Example 4:** `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 1 (need 2 more people to form a tent of 3)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a valid tent with extroverts)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible to accommodate)
   - **Example 5:** `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 3 (1 tent of 3 people)
     - Universals: 2 (can form another tent of 3 people with 1 universal and 1 introvert)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (universals) = 3
   - **Example 6:** `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 (19 tents)
     - Extroverts: 7 (need 14 more people to form 3 tents of 3 people)
     - Universals: 18 (enough to form valid tents with extroverts and universals)
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28
   - **Example 7:** `0 0 0`
     - No participants, so no tents needed.
     - Total tents: 0
   - **Example 8:** `7 0 0`
     - Only introverts, so 7 tents needed.
     - Total tents: 7
   - **Example 9:** `0 24 0`
     - Only extroverts, so 8 tents needed.
     - Total tents: 8
   - **Example 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 tents)
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (need 2000000000 more people to form 333333334 tents of 3 people)
     - Universals: 1000000000 (enough to form valid tents with extroverts and universals)
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (extroverts and universals) = 1666666667

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles the problem description and edge cases. It ensures that introverts are always alone, extroverts are always in tents of 3 people, and universals are used to fill the remaining spots as needed. The program returns -1 when it is impossible to form valid tents, and it calculates the minimum number of tents required otherwise.
