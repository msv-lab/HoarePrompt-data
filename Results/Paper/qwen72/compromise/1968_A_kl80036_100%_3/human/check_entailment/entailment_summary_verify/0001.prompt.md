You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    1000
    
    6

Output

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and prints the value of `x - 1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution.

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an integer \( x \) and need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) represents the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The provided program sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - We need to check if \( y = x - 1 \) always maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

3. **GCD Calculation:**
   - For \( y = x - 1 \), the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) is \( \gcd(x, x-1) \).
   - The GCD of two consecutive integers is always 1, because consecutive integers are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1).

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - When \( y = x - 1 \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) becomes \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) \).
   - Since \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \), the expression simplifies to \( 1 + (x-1) = x \).

5. **Maximizing the Expression:**
   - We need to check if \( x \) is the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \le y < x \).
   - For any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \le y < x \), the maximum value of \( y \) is \( x - 1 \).
   - The maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) \) for any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \le y < x \) is at most \( x - 1 \) (since \( y \) is less than \( x \)).
   - Therefore, the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is \( 1 + (x-1) = x \), which is achieved when \( y = x - 1 \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) for each test case.
   - This choice of \( y \) ensures that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct because it always finds a valid \( y \) (which is \( x - 1 \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
