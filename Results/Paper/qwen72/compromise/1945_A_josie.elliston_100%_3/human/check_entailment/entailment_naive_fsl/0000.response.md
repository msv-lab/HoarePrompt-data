Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- There is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal.
- The introvert must be in a tent alone, so we need 1 tent for the introvert.
- The extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people, but there is only one universal left, which is not enough to satisfy the extrovert's requirement.
- Therefore, it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, and the output should be -1.

However, the program outputs 1, which is incorrect. This is because `func_1` does not correctly check if the remaining universals can satisfy the extroverts' requirement of being in a tent with exactly two others.
