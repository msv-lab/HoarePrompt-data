The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `isqrt(x)`. To ensure the loop executes, the range must have at least one value. This means that `isqrt(x) + 1` must be greater than 1, which implies `isqrt(x)` must be at least 1. Since `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`, `x` must be at least 1 for `isqrt(x)` to be 1 or more.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` and `n` are integers provided by the user input, where 1 <= `n` <= `x`
- `ans` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the user input where 1 <= `x`, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 1 <= `n` <= `x`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
