Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided is not correct for the given problem. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The program attempts to find the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i` for `i` ranging from 1 to the integer square root of `x`. However, this approach does not correctly find the maximum GCD of `n` sub-problems that sum up to `x`.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to find the maximum integer `d` such that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with a difficulty that is a multiple of `d`. This can be done by iterating from `d = x // n` down to 1 and checking if `x` is divisible by `d` and if `x // d` is at least `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for d in range(x // n, 0, -1):
        if x % d == 0:
            print(d)
            return
```

This corrected version will correctly find the maximum balance for the given problem. It starts from the largest possible divisor of `x` that can be used to create `n` sub-problems and checks if `x` is divisible by `d`. If it is, it prints `d` and returns, ensuring that the maximum possible GCD is found.
