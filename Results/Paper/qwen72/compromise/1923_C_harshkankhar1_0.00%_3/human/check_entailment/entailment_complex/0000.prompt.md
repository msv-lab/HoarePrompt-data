Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) representing the borders of the subarray (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The list `b` will contain cumulative sums of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Specifically, for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 1`; otherwise, `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 2`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` will remain unchanged.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 1 3 6 10 15 (where the values are the cumulative sums of the original list `a`)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the loop executes all iterations. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` also remain unchanged. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `q`, and a list `a` of integers. It then constructs a list `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1. After that, it prints the cumulative sums of the original list `a`. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a pair of integers `(x, y)` and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in the subarray `b[x:y]` and `x` is not equal to `y`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. The original input variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` are not used or modified within the function.
