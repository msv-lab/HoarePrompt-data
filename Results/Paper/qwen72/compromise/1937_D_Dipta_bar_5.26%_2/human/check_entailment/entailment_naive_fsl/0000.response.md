Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball in all cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. A simpler and more accurate approach would be to simulate the movement of the pinball directly for each cell, keeping track of the direction changes and the number of steps taken until the pinball leaves the grid.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
>><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 4 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program produces incorrect output for this input, which can be verified by simulating the pinball's movement:

- For the first cell (index 0), the pinball moves right to index 1, then left to index 0, and finally right to leave the grid. This takes 3 seconds.
- For the second cell (index 1), the pinball moves right to index 2, then left to index 1, and finally right to leave the grid. This takes 4 seconds.
- For the third cell (index 2), the pinball moves left to index 1, then right to index 2, and finally left to leave the grid. This takes 1 second.

The program's output does not match this expected behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
