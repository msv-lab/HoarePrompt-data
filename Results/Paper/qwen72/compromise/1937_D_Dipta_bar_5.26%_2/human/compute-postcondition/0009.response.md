Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `B` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '<' characters multiplied by their respective positions since the last '>' character in reverse order, `idx_B` is a list of indices where each '<' character is located in the string `s` in reverse order, `l` is 0.**

The variable `l` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`A`, `B`, and `idx_B`) remain unchanged. The initial state of `B` and `idx_B` is still valid, and `A` is also unchanged.
