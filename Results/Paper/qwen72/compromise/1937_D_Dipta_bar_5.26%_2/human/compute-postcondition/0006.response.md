Output State: **`A` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '>' characters multiplied by their respective positions since the last '<' character. `idx_A` is a list of indices where each '>' character is located in the string `s`. The length of `A` and `idx_A` is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`. `B` is an empty list. `idx_B` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `idx_B` as an empty list, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of `idx_B` as an empty list.
