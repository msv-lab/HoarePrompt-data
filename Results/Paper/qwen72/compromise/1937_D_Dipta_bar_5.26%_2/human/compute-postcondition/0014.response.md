Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It processes the string to compute and print a series of integers. Each integer represents a specific calculation based on the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A` and `B` contain intermediate results used for the calculations, but these lists are not returned or exposed to the user. **
