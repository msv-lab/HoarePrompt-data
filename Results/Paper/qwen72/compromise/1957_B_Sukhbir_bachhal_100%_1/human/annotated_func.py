#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided is incomplete. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, k):` where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). `n` is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n` (including the leading 1).
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It returns the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus one. If `n` is 0, the function returns -1. The parameter `k` is not used in the function.
