The value of `position` is incremented by 1, so `position` becomes 3. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` is not equal to 0 if it was greater than 1 before is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 25000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `n` is not equal to 0 if it was greater than 1 before, `position` is 3.**
