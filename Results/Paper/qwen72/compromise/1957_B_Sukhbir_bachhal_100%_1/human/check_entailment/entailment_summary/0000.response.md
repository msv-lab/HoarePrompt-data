### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the highest bit position in the binary representation of `n` that is set to 1. This is done by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0 and counting the number of shifts.
   - The function returns `position - 1`, which correctly gives the highest bit position (0-indexed) of the most significant bit set to 1 in `n`.
   - For example, `func_1(5)` returns 2 because the binary representation of 5 is `101`, and the highest bit set is at position 2.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program:
     - Calls `func_1(k)` to find the highest bit position in `k`.
     - Appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position found. For example, if `counter` is 2, `2 ** 2 - 1` is 3, which is `11` in binary.
     - Appends `k - arr[-1]` to the array `arr`. This ensures that the sum of the first two elements in `arr` equals `k`.
     - Appends `n - 2` zeros to the array `arr` to meet the requirement of having `n` elements.
   - If `n` is 1, the program simply prints `k`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sum Condition**: The sum of the elements in `arr` is always `k` because the first element is `2 ** counter - 1` and the second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, and the rest are zeros.
   - **Maximize 1s in Binary Representation**:
     - The first element `2 ** counter - 1` has all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
     - The second element `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` ensures that the sum is `k` and does not affect the maximization of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the elements.
     - The rest of the elements are zeros, which do not affect the bitwise OR operation.
   - **Output Format**: The program correctly outputs the sequence of `n` elements for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements of the problem description and the execution summary. It correctly constructs the sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

**Correctness: True**
