Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `k`. This is used to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The function correctly returns `-1` when `n` is `0`, which is not a valid case according to the problem constraints (since `1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5`), so this part is irrelevant.
   - The function iterates through the bits of `n` (which should be `k`), shifting right until `n` becomes `0`. The variable `position` is incremented in each iteration, effectively counting the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The function returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position that is set in `k`.

2. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to get the highest bit position set in `k`.
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position in `k`.
     - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to `arr`, which is the remaining value needed to sum up to `k`.
     - It appends `0` to `arr` for the remaining `n - 2` elements.
     - It prints the array `arr`.
   - If `n` is 1:
     - It simply prints `k`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the highest bit position set in `k`.
   - The main program correctly constructs the sequence for `n > 1` by ensuring the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.
   - For `n = 1`, the program correctly outputs `k`.

However, there is a potential issue with the sequence construction for `n > 1`:
   - The sequence construction might not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. For example, if `k` is a power of 2, the sequence `[k-1, 1, 0, 0, ...]` will not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. Instead, a better approach would be to distribute the bits more evenly.

Despite this, the program generally follows the problem constraints and outputs a valid sequence for most cases. However, the specific issue with the sequence construction for `n > 1` when `k` is a power of 2 means the program is not always optimal.

Therefore, the program is **not fully correct** due to the potential suboptimal sequence construction.

Correctness: **False**
