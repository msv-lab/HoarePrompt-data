The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` will be 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 1**
