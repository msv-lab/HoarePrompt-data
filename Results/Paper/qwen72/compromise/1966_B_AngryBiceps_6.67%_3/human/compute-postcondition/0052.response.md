Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. If the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the condition `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row` is true. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is not 1, or the first string of `a` is equal to the last string of `a`, and either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.***
