Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`.
- Initially, `last_row` is an empty string, so after the execution, `last_row` will be the last character of the string in `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `i`) remain unchanged.
