Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than or equal to `n` (this seems to be a typo and might mean `n` is a new input integer).
- `m` is a new input integer.
- `a` is a list containing `n` strings.
- `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together.
- `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, meaning all characters in `first_row` are the same.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state. The initial state does not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **NO**
