Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input values, `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`, `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` input values concatenated together.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` input values, `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first characters of all the input values in `a` concatenated together, and `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last characters of all the input values in `a` concatenated together. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The variables `t` and `m` remain unchanged, and `_` is still 1.
