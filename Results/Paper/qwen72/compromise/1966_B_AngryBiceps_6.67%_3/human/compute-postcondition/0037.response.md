Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing two strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(input())` adds a new input string to the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` contained one string.
- After executing the code, `a` now contains two strings.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
