You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. Each of the next n lines contains m characters, either 'W' or 'B', representing the initial colors of the grid. The function should output "YES" or "NO" for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings for the last test case, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` for the last test case, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` for the last test case, `i` is `n-1`. For each of the `t` test cases, the function has printed "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions: if the first string in `a` contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, or if the first row is composed of the same character repeated and this character is different from the character in the last row, then "NO" is printed; otherwise, "YES" is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, each containing a grid of characters 'W' or 'B'. It outputs "YES" for each test case if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color, and "NO" if it is not possible.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
