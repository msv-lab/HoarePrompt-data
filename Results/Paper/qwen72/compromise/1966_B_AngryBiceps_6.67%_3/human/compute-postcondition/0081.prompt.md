Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. Each of the next n lines contains m characters, either 'W' or 'B', representing the initial colors of the grid. The function should output "YES" or "NO" for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the first string in `a` has only one unique character and is different from the last string in `a`. Otherwise, the first string in `a` either has more than one unique character or is equal to the last string in `a`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the first row is composed of the same character repeated, and this character is different from the character in the last row. Otherwise, the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of a single repeated character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the condition `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]` is true. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` does not consist of a single repeated character, or the first string in `a` is equal to the last string in `a`, and either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `m` is a new input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input values, `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`, `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` input values concatenated together. If the first element of `a` contains only one unique character and is different from the last element of `a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
