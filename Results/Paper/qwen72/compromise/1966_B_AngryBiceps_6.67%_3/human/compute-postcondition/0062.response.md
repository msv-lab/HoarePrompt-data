Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing one input value, `first_row` is the first character of the input value in `a`, `i` is 0, `last_row` is the last character of the input value in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`.
- Since `a` contains one input value, `a[-1]` refers to this single element.
- The last character of this element is then appended to `last_row`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
