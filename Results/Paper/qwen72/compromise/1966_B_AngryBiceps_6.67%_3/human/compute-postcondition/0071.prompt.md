Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`, `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing one input value, `first_row` is the first character of the input value in `a`, `i` is 0, `last_row` is the last character of the input value in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing two input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second input value in `a`, `i` is 1, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second input value in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing three input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second input value in `a` and the first character of the third input value in `a`, `i` is 2, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second input value in `a` and the last character of the third input value in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
