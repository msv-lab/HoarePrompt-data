Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(input())` adds a new input string to the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` contained one input string, so after the execution, `a` now contains two input strings.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The variables `first_row` and `last_row` still refer to the first and last characters of the string in `a` at index 0, respectively.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
