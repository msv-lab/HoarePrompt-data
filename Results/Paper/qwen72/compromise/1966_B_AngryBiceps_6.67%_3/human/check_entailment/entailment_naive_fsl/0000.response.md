Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the entire grid and only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the interior of the grid contains a mix of colors that cannot be unified with the given operations.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following grid:

```
3 3
B W B
W B W
B W B
```

The program will output "YES" because the first and last rows are the same, and the first and last columns are the same. However, it is impossible to make all squares in this grid the same color using the allowed operations. Any operation that selects two 'B' or two 'W' squares will not be able to change the entire grid to a single color due to the alternating pattern. Therefore, the correct output should be "NO".
