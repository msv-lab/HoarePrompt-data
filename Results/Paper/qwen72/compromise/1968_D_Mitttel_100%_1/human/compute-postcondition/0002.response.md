Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where `1 <= s[0], s[1] <= n`. `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= 10^9`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `cur` is now assigned the value 0.
