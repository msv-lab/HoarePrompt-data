You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and p are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. s is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where 1 <= s[0], s[1] <= n. k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: The loop terminates when either `vis[s]` is 1 or `k` is 0. At this point, `mx` will be the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution. `cur` will be the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited in the loop. `k` will be the remaining number of iterations, which is 0 if the loop terminated due to `k` reaching 0, or a positive integer if the loop terminated due to `vis[s]` being 1. `vis` will be a list of length `n` where each element visited by `s` during the loop will be 1, and all other elements will remain 0.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited in the loop, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `a[s]` is the value at position `s` in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`. It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `a[s]` is the value at position `s` in the list `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited in the loop, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `a[s]` is the value at position `s` in the list `a`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
