Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to simulate the game for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns, calculating the maximum possible score the player can achieve. However, the current implementation does not correctly simulate the player's decision to either stay at the current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` updates `mx` with `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, which suggests that the player will stay at the same position for the remaining `k` turns. This is not correct because the player can choose to move to `p[s]` on each turn, and the decision should be based on which option gives a higher score.

2. **Visitation Check**: The `vis` array is used to track visited positions, but it is only used to break the loop if the same position is visited again. This is not necessary for the game simulation, as the game lasts exactly `k` turns, and the player can visit the same position multiple times.

3. **Score Update Logic**: The score should be updated based on the best possible move at each turn, not just the current position.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly simulate the game, the function should:
- Track the current score and position.
- For each turn, decide whether to stay at the current position or move to the next position based on which option gives a higher score.
- Continue this process for `k` turns.

### Suggested Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        score += a[s]
        if a[s] + a[p[s]] > a[s]:
            s = p[s]
    return score
```

### Full Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        score += a[s]
        if a[s] + a[p[s]] > a[s]:
            s = p[s]
    return score
```

This corrected version ensures that the player makes the optimal move at each turn to maximize their score.
