The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 30` and `c` is any integer. It calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and `c` is not stored or used outside the loop.
