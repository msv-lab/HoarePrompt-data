Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem described. Here are the issues:

1. **Variable Mismatch**: The problem description specifies that the input for each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the program reads three integers but assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is incorrect because `c` is not used in the problem, and `b` and `c` should be `a` and `b` respectively.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, but it should be `b / 2` because `b` is the price for two yogurts on promotion. The logic to determine the minimum cost is also flawed. The correct approach should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

3. **Rounding Issue**: The use of `round(a * d)` is incorrect. The program should not round the result of `a * d` but instead calculate the total cost correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price
        remaining_cost = (n % 2) * a
        # Total minimum cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + remaining_cost
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost for each test case.
