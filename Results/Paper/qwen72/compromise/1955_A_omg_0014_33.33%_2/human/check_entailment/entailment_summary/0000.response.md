Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The program is supposed to determine the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the price per yogurt `a` and the promotional price for two yogurts `b`. However, the program incorrectly processes the input and performs calculations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, but the problem description only mentions `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` is not part of the problem's input, and it seems to be a mistake in the program.

2. **Calculation Logic**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This logic is incorrect because:
   - `d` should be the price per yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotional price, which is `b / 2`.
   - The comparison `a * b < a * d` is not meaningful in the context of the problem. Instead, the program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the regular price and the promotional price.

3. **Output**: The program prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, which are not the correct values for the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

To correct the program, we need to:
- Read the correct input variables `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- Calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the regular price and the promotional price.
- Determine the minimum cost and print it.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost using the promotional price and the regular price
        cost_with_promotion = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        cost_without_promotion = n * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_with_promotion, cost_without_promotion))

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected program:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- Calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotional price and the regular price.
- Prints the minimum of the two costs.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
