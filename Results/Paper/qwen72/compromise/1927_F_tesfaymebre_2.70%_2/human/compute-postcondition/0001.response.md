The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `test_cases` is greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
