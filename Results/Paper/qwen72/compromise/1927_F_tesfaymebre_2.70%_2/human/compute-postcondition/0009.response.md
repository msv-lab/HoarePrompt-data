The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex in the graph, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal.

- Case_1: The function returns the list `path` which represents the current path in the DFS traversal.
- Case_2: The function returns an empty list.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `curr`, `parent`, and `path`, and returns the current path in the DFS traversal if a specific condition is met. If the condition is not met, it returns an empty list.**
