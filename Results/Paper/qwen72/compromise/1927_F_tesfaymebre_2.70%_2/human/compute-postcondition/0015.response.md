To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which `res` is defined:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` remain the same as their initial values.
   - `graph` is a defaultdict of type list with the same structure as before.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by weight.
   - `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class with size `n + 1` and updated parent and rank structures.
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were added to the union.
   - `node_u` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight.
   - `node_v` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight.
   - `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0.
   - `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.

2. **Understanding the `dfs` function:**
   - The `dfs` function is typically used to perform a depth-first search on a graph.
   - It is called with `node_u` (the starting node), `-1` (the parent node, which is initially set to -1 to indicate no parent), and an empty list (which will be used to store the result of the DFS traversal).

3. **What `res` contains:**
   - The `dfs` function will traverse the graph starting from `node_u` and will return a list of nodes visited during the traversal.
   - Since the exact structure of the `graph` and the `edges` list are not provided, we can't determine the exact nodes that will be visited.
   - However, we know that `res` will be a list of nodes that are part of the connected component starting from `node_u`.

4. **Output of `print(*res)`:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the list `res` and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - The elements of `res` are the nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from `node_u`.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from `node_u`. Since the exact nodes are not specified, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **[nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from node_u] (where node_u is the node from the edge with the minimum weight and the nodes are the elements of the list res)**
