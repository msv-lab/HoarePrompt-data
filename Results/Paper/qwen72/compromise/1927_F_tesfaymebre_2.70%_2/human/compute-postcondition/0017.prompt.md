You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain the same as their initial values. `graph` is a defaultdict of type list, where each key is a node `u` or `v` from the `func_3()` output, and the value is a list of nodes that `u` or `v` are connected to. `edges` is a list of tuples, each containing a weight `w` and the nodes `u` and `v` that are connected by this edge, as returned by `func_3()`.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain the same as their initial values, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list with the same structure as before, `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by weight, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class with size `n + 1` and updated parent and rank structures, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were added to the union, `node_u` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight, `node_v` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges added to the union, and len(res) is the number of elements in the list returned by the dfs function starting from node_u)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from node_u] (where node_u is the node from the edge with the minimum weight and the nodes are the elements of the list res)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified. It is implied that the function operates on predefined or internally generated values of `n` and `m` that represent the number of vertices and edges in a graph, respectively, with the constraints 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
