### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Graph Construction:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It then constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and stores the edges in a list `edges` with their weights, vertices, and sorts the edges in descending order of weight.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - A `DSU` class is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `DSU` class is initialized with `n + 1` elements (to handle 1-based indexing).

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges (from heaviest to lightest).
   - For each edge, it checks if the two vertices are already in the same component using the `find` method.
   - If they are, it means a cycle exists, and the program updates the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the vertices `node_u` and `node_v` that form this cycle.
   - If they are not in the same component, it unites them using the `union` method.

4. **DFS for Cycle Traversal:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycle starting from `node_u`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited).
   - The DFS function `dfs` appends the current node to the path and recursively visits its neighbors.
   - If a node is revisited (i.e., its color is 1), it returns the path, indicating a cycle.
   - The cycle is then printed with the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in the order they were traversed.

### Issues:

1. **Cycle Detection Logic:**
   - The program incorrectly updates the union operation when a cycle is detected. The `union` method should only be called when the two vertices are not in the same component.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to ensure the union operation is only performed when the vertices are not already connected.

2. **DFS Cycle Traversal:**
   - The DFS function `dfs` does not correctly handle the cycle detection. It should return the cycle path when it detects a back edge to a node that is already in the path.
   - The current implementation of `dfs` may not return the correct cycle path.

3. **DSU Class:**
   - The `DSU` class is not defined in the provided code. It is assumed to have methods `find` and `union`, but the implementation details are missing.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as it stands. The cycle detection logic and DFS traversal need to be fixed, and the `DSU` class should be properly defined.

Correctness: **False**
