You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` from the input, processes it to generate a list `arr` with up to 3 elements based on the value of `lex`, sorts `arr`, and then prints the corresponding lowercase letters (based on the ASCII values of the elements in `arr` plus 96) for each of the 3 elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the decoded words for each test case. After the function concludes, `cases` is 0, and the state of other variables (`i`, `j`, `k`, `lex`, `arr`) is undefined as they are local to the function and reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `lex` which represents the encoded word.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then iterates 2 times (for the first two letters) and checks the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The program then sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - Finally, it prints the corresponding characters for the values in `arr`.

4. **Issues with the Algorithm**:
   - The logic for determining the positions of the letters is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `if lex <= 26` and `elif lex < 52` do not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining sum to the letters.
   - The program should ensure that the sum of the positions of the three letters equals `lex` and that the letters are as small as possible while maintaining the sum.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter to make the sum equal to `lex`.
   - We can achieve this by:
     - Assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first letter.
     - Assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the second letter.
     - Adjusting the third letter to make the sum equal to `lex`.

6. **Example**:
   - For `lex = 24`, the correct approach would be:
     - First letter: 1 (a)
     - Second letter: 1 (a)
     - Third letter: 24 - 1 - 1 = 22 (v)
     - Result: "aav"

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly handle the distribution of the sum to the letters, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
