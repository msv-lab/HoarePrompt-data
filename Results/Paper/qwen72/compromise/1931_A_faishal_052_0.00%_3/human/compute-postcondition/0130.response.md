The only variables in the loop head are `k` and the `range` value, which is 3. So, we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the `range` value. If `k` is less than the `range` value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and the `range` is 3. At the start of the next iteration, `k` is increased by 1, so `k` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than 3.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `range` is 3, `lex` is the same as before, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order**
