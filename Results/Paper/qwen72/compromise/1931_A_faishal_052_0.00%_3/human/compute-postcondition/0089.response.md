The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `cases` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer.**
