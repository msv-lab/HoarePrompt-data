Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `j` is 0, `range` is 2.**

The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `lex`, `j`, and `range`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
