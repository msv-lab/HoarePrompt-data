The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and `range`. For the loop to execute, the `range` must be greater than 0, and `k` must be initialized to a value that is within the range specified by `range`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `cases` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `j` is 2 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it (not relevant to the loop head)
- `k` is 3 (this needs to be adjusted)
- `range` is 3 (this is the range for the loop)
- `lex` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)

To ensure the loop executes, `k` should be initialized to 0, and `range` should be 3, as specified.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it, `k` is 0, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer**
