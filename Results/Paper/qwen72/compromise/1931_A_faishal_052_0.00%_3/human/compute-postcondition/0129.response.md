To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `range` is 3.
   - `lex` is the same as before (though not explicitly defined, it doesn't affect the current print statement).
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses the `chr` function to convert a number to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The number being converted is `arr[k] + 96`.
   - `k` is 1, so `arr[k]` is the element at index 1 of the list `arr`.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the element at index 1 is the second smallest element in the list.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the second smallest element in `arr` as `arr[1]`.
   - The `chr` function will convert `arr[1] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so `chr(97)` is 'a'.
   - Therefore, `chr(arr[1] + 96)` will be the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[1] + 96`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact character printed depends on the value of `arr[1]`.
   - If `arr[1]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
   - If `arr[1]` is 2, then `chr(2 + 96)` is `chr(98)`, which is 'b'.
   - If `arr[1]` is 3, then `chr(3 + 96)` is `chr(99)`, which is 'c'.
   - And so on.

Since the exact value of `arr[1]` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the value of `arr[1]`.

Output: **[chr(arr[1] + 96)] (where arr[1] is the second smallest element in the sorted list `arr`)**
