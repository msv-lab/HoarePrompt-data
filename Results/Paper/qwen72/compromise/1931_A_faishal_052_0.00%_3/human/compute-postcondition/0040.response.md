The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the `range` value, which is 3. The loop iterates over the range 3, and at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and the `range` value must still be 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 2`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, [1, `lex - 27`, 26] if `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 52`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `k` is 1, range is 3**
