The only objects in the loop head are the variable `k` and the `range` value, which is 3. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The `range` value remains 3.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it, `k` is 1, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer**
