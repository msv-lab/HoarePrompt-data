Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]`, `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. The initial condition that `lex` is greater than or equal to 26 is still valid, so `arr` remains a list containing `[26, 26]`. All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `range`) remain unchanged.
