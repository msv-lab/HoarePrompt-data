The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the `range` value, which is 2. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the range is 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list with one element [1]. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing [26].**
