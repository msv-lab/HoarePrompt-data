Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the range is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now less than or equal to 24, and `arr` is a list with three elements [1, 1, 26]. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 26, `lex` is now greater than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 1, 26]. If `lex` is greater than 25, `arr` is a list containing [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex - 26`.**
