The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the range value, which is 3. For the loop to execute, the range value must be at least 1. Since the range is 3, the loop will execute. The variable `k` starts at 0 and will iterate up to 2 (inclusive). The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 2`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, [1, `lex - 27`, 26] if `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 52`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `k` is 0, range is 3**
