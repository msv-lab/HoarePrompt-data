Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, and `lex` is an input integer. After the loop executes all the iterations, `arr` will contain 2 elements. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain two 1s, and `lex` will be updated to `lex` minus 2. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, `arr` will contain one 26 and one 1, and `lex` will be updated to `lex` minus 27. If `lex` is greater than 52, `arr` will contain two 26s, and `lex` will be updated to `lex` minus 52.**
