The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. The initial state specifies different possible values for `arr` based on the value of `lex`. However, the specific value of `lex` is not provided, so we need to consider all possible cases for `arr` and update them accordingly.

1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1]`.
2. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 1]`.
3. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
4. If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is `[26, 26]`.

In all cases, `arr.append(26)` will add `26` to the end of the list `arr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
