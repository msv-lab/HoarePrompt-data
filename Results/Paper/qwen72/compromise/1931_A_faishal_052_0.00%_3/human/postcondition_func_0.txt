The function `func` reads an integer `cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` from the input, processes it to generate a list `arr` with up to 3 elements based on the value of `lex`, sorts `arr`, and then prints the corresponding lowercase letters (based on the ASCII values of the elements in `arr` plus 96) for each of the 3 elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the decoded words for each test case. After the function concludes, `cases` is 0, and the state of other variables (`i`, `j`, `k`, `lex`, `arr`) is undefined as they are local to the function and reset for each test case.
