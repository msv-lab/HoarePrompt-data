#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, and each element x_i in arr satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and n is equal to the length of arr plus one.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[0]` added multiple times to the cumulative sum of `ans[0]` and `arr[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[0]` added multiple times to the cumulative sum of `ans[0]` and `arr[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`. The last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element (from index 1 to `n-2`), `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be formed by adding `ans[0]` multiple times to the cumulative sum of previous elements in `ans` and `arr`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element `ans[-2]` and the last element of `arr`.
