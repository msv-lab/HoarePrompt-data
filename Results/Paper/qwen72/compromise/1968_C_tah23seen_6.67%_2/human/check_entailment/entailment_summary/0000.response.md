### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `ans[0]`:**
   - The function initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This is a valid choice because `ans[0]` must be greater than `arr[0]` to ensure that `arr[0] = a_2 \bmod a_1` holds true. Since `a_1` is `ans[0]` and `a_2` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`, the remainder when `a_2` is divided by `a_1` will indeed be `arr[0]`.

2. **Construction of `ans[i]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n-2`:**
   - The function constructs `ans[i + 1]` as `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i]` and that `arr[i] = a_{i+1} \bmod a_i` holds true.
   - The additional check `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:` and the subsequent `while` loop ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is adjusted to be at least as large as `arr[i + 1]` by adding multiples of `ans[i]`. This is necessary to ensure that the remainder condition is satisfied for all elements in the array.

3. **Construction of `ans[-1]`:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `arr[-1] = a_n \bmod a_{n-1}` holds true, as `ans[-1]` is constructed to be exactly `arr[-1]` more than `ans[-2]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, ensuring that the output format matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. The logic ensures that each element `a_i` is within the specified range and that the remainder conditions are met. The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, and the output matches the problem requirements.
