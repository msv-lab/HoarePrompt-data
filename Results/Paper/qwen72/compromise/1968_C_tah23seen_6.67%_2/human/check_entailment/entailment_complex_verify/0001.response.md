### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements.
   - This matches the problem description and ensures that the input is handled correctly.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This is a valid choice because `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` and `arr[0] + 1` will always be greater than `arr[0]`.

3. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array `arr` from the first to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element `i` in `arr`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it enters a while loop to increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to produce the correct result.
   - The while loop is crucial for ensuring that `ans[i + 1]` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.

4. **Final Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[-1] \bmod ans[-2] = arr[-1]`, which is required by the problem statement.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing each element of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm ensures that each `a_i` is constructed such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.
- The while loop in the construction of `ans[i + 1]` ensures that the condition `ans[i + 1] >= arr[i + 1]` is met, which is necessary for the modulo operation to produce the correct result.
- The final element `ans[-1]` is constructed correctly to satisfy the last modulo condition.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly by setting `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` to `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
- The program also handles the case where `arr[i + 1]` is greater than `ans[i + 1]` by incrementing `ans[i + 1]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

### Verification Using Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `arr` is a list of integers where `1 <= len(arr) <= 500`, and each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`.
  - `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`, and `n` is equal to the length of `arr` plus one.
- **State within the function:**
  - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, which is a valid and necessary step.
  - The loop constructs each `ans[i + 1]` such that `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[0]` added multiple times to the cumulative sum of `ans[0]` and `arr[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
  - The final element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, ensuring the last modulo condition is met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The annotations and the reasoning provided in the original assessment are accurate.
