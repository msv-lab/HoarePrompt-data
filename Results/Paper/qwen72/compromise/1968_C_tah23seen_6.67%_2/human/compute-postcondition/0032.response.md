Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, and `ans[n]` is updated to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`. If `ans[n]` is less than `arr[n-1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and all other elements in `ans` are updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of `ans[i + 1]` and `ans[i]` for all `i` from `n - 1` to `1` (inclusive), until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. If `ans[n]` is greater than or equal to `arr[n-1]`, then `ans` remains unchanged. `i` is `0` or the loop has terminated because `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.**
