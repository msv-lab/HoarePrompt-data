Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, and each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, and `n` is equal to the length of `arr` plus one. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, the current value of `ans[i + 1]` remains equal to or greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, and `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + ans[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and all other elements in `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, and `ans[n]` is updated to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`. If `ans[n]` is less than `arr[n-1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and all other elements in `ans` are updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of `ans[i + 1]` and `ans[i]` for all `i` from `n - 1` to `1` (inclusive), until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. If `ans[n]` is greater than or equal to `arr[n-1]`, then `ans` remains unchanged. `i` is `0` or the loop has terminated because `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
