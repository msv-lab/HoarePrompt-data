To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the loop logic step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user.
- `count` is initialized to `m + 1`.
- `ans` is initialized to `n`.

### Loop Logic:
The loop continues as long as `g` is greater than or equal to `count - 1` and `count` does not exceed `m`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `count = m + 1`
   - `ans = n`
   - `g` is updated in each iteration to `n / count - (count - 1)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop stops when `g < count - 1` or `count > m`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.
   - `g` is updated to `n / count - (count - 1)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `count = m + 1`
   - `g = n / (m + 1) - m`
   - `ans = n + (g / (m + 1) + 1)`
   - `count = m + 2`
   - `g` is updated to `n / (m + 2) - (m + 1)`

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - The loop continues, updating `ans` and `g` in each iteration until one of the loop conditions is met.

3. **Loop Termination:**
   - The loop stops when `g < count - 1` or `count > m`.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans` after the loop has completed. The value of `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of adjustments made in each iteration of the loop, where each adjustment is calculated as `g / count + 1` and `g` is updated in each iteration to `n / count - (count - 1)`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the integer value of `ans` after the loop has completed.

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the sum of n and the series of adjustments made in each iteration of the loop, and each adjustment is calculated as g / count + 1, with g being updated to n / count - (count - 1) in each iteration until g < count - 1 or count > m)**
