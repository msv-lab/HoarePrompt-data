Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of adjustments made in each iteration of the loop, where each adjustment is calculated as `g / count + 1` and `g` is updated in each iteration to `n / count - (count - 1)`. The loop stops when `g` is less than `count - 1` or when `count` exceeds `m`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as the specific positive integer provided by the user.
- The variable `i` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user for that specific test case.
- The variable `count` will be `m + 1` for each test case, as the loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`.
- The variable `ans` will be the final result for each test case, which is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the adjustments made in each iteration of the loop. Each adjustment is calculated as `g / count + 1`, where `g` is updated in each iteration to `n / count - (count - 1)`. The loop stops either when `count` exceeds `m` or when `g` is less than `count - 1`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has processed all `t` test cases.
