The function `func` is expected to accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and an additional parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, the function calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and the sum a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The function returns the count of such ordered pairs for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `m` are positive integers for each test case, with 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. For each test case, the function returns the count of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).**
