You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are provided, and the function should calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of adjustments made in each iteration of the loop, where each adjustment is calculated as `g / count + 1` and `g` is updated in each iteration to `n / count - (count - 1)`. The loop stops when `g` is less than `count - 1` or when `count` exceeds `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `m` are positive integers for each test case, with 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. For each test case, the function returns the count of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
