You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user, and calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This implies that \(\frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) must be an integer.
   - Simplifying, \(\frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)}\).
   - For this to be an integer, \(\frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) must be an integer, which means \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes the number of test cases \(t\) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes the count of valid pairs to \(n\) (which is incorrect, as it should be 0).
   - It then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates \(countmins = count - 1\).
   - It calculates \(g = \frac{n}{count}\) and checks if \(g < countmins\). If true, it breaks the loop.
   - It updates \(g\) by subtracting \(countmins\) and then adds \(\frac{g}{count} + 1\) to the answer.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of the answer.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Initialization of `ans`**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `ans = 0` because we are counting valid pairs, and initially, there are none.
   - **Calculation of `g`**: The calculation \(g = \frac{n}{count}\) is not correct. It should be \(g = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{count} \right\rfloor\) to ensure integer division.
   - **Update of `ans`**: The update \(ans += \frac{g}{count} + 1\) is also incorrect. The correct update should be \(ans += \left\lfloor \frac{g}{count} \right\rfloor + 1\).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Initialize `ans` to 0.
   - Iterate over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), iterate over \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, increment `ans`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program has several logical and mathematical issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. The initialization of `ans` and the calculations within the loop are incorrect, leading to an incorrect count of valid pairs.
