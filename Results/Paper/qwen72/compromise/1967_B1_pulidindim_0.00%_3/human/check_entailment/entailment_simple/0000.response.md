### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2, which is used to iterate over possible values of `b`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is the starting point for counting valid pairs.

3. **Loop for Calculating Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - `g` is then updated to `g - countmins`.
   - `ans` is incremented by `g / count + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the integer value of `ans`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The function initializes `ans` to `n`, which is incorrect because it assumes that all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid without checking the condition.
- The loop logic is flawed:
  - `g` is calculated as `n / count`, which is not the correct way to find the number of valid pairs.
  - The condition `if g < countmins` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
  - The adjustment `g -= countmins` and `ans += g / count + 1` do not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:

- For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- A more straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and count the pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The initialization and loop logic are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**
