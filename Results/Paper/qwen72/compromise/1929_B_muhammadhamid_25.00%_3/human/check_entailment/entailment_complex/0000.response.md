### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
   - This is consistent with the problem description, where multiple test cases are provided.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `k == 1`, the function prints `1`. This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to be colored, the minimum number of cells to color is 1 (any cell on that diagonal).

3. **General Case**:
   - If `k <= 2 * n`, the function prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
     - This is correct because in a grid of size `n x n`, there are `2 * n` main diagonals (both primary and secondary diagonals). To cover `k` diagonals, you need to color at least `math.ceil(k / 2)` cells. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one primary and one secondary).
   - If `k > 2 * n`, the function prints `k // 2 + 1`.
     - This is also correct because once you have covered all `2 * n` main diagonals, you need to start covering the remaining diagonals. Each additional cell will cover 2 diagonals, so you need `k // 2` cells to cover the remaining `k - 2 * n` diagonals. However, since you are already covering `2 * n` diagonals with `n` cells, you need to add 1 more cell to cover the remaining diagonals, hence `k // 2 + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `k == 1` separately.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is greater than `2 * n` correctly.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct minimum number of cells for each test case, which matches the expected output in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
