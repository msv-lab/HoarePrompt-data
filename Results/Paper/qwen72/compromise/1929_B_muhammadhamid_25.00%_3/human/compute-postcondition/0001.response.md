Output State: **The loop will execute for each input pair (n, k) provided, and for each pair, it will print a value based on the conditions: if k is 1, it prints 1; if k is less than or equal to 2 * n, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2; otherwise, it prints k divided by 2 plus 1. The values of n and k will be read from input for each iteration, and the loop will continue until all input pairs have been processed.**
