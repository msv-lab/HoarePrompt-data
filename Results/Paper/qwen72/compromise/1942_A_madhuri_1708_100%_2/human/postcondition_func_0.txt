The function reads lines from the standard input, where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it processes `n` and `k` and prints an array or a `-1` based on the following conditions: If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints an array of `k` elements, each being `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints an array of `n` elements, each being the index `j + 1` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all input lines, the function finishes, and the final state of the program is the sequence of printed arrays or `-1` values.
