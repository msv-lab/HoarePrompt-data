Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling `k == 1`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1` by printing a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. This is a valid solution because the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is itself.

2. **Handling `k >= 2`**:
   - The program checks if `k >= 2` and then further checks if `n == k`. If `n == k`, it prints an array of `k` elements, all equal to `k`. This is incorrect because an array of `k` elements, all equal to `k`, will have `n` sorted cyclic shifts, not `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
   - If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`. This is not always correct. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Handling `k == n`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == n` by printing an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`. However, this is not the only valid solution. Any array with all elements equal will have `n` sorted cyclic shifts, so a simpler solution would be to print an array of `n` elements, all equal to 1.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program does not handle the general case where `k` is between 2 and `n-1`. For such cases, a valid array can be constructed by placing a sequence of increasing numbers followed by a smaller number to ensure exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == n:
            print(*[1 for _ in range(n)])
        elif k == 1:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
        elif k > 1 and k < n:
            # Construct an array with k-1 increasing elements followed by a smaller element
            print(*([i + 1 for i in range(k)] + [1 for _ in range(n - k)]))
        else:
            print('-1')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version handles all cases correctly:
- If `k == n`, it prints an array of `n` elements, all equal to 1.
- If `k == 1`, it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
- If `k` is between 2 and `n-1`, it constructs an array with `k-1` increasing elements followed by a smaller element to ensure exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
- If `k` is not valid (i.e., `k > n`), it prints `-1`.
