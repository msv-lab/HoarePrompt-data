The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` and `b` are of equal length and contain digits from 1 to 9. The function then constructs two new strings, `kq1` and `kq2`, such that for each position where `a` and `b` have the same digit, `kq1` and `kq2` will have that same digit. For the first position where `a` and `b` differ, the smaller digit is placed in `kq1` and the larger digit in `kq2`. For all subsequent differing positions, the larger digit is placed in `kq1` and the smaller digit in `kq2`. Finally, the function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The function does not return any value.
