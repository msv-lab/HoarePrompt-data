Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i` where the loop breaks or completes. If `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `ans` contains the absolute differences from index `temp` to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences from index 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`.***
