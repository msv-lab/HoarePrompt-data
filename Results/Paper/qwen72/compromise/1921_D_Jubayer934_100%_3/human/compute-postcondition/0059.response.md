The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `temp`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `temp + 1`, `ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`.**
