Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `_` is a placeholder variable.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a`, where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks or `n` if the loop completes all iterations.
- `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks.
- `temp` is -1 if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks. If `temp` is not -1, `temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `i` is `n - 1`, and `ans` has `n - temp` new elements, each of which is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(ans))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Lists `a` and `b`**:
   - `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
   - `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.

2. **List `ans`**:
   - `ans` is populated with the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - If the loop completes all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, and `ans` will contain `n` elements.
   - If the loop breaks at some index `i`, `ans` will contain `i` elements.

3. **Variable `temp`**:
   - `temp` is -1 if the loop completes all iterations.
   - If the loop breaks, `temp` is the index at which the loop breaks, and `ans` will have `n - temp` new elements added to it, each being the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n - 1`.

4. **Sum of `ans`**:
   - The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of all elements in the list `ans`.
   - The elements in `ans` are the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a`, where `i` is either `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks.

### Final Output:
The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a`, where `i` is either `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks. If `temp` is not -1, it indicates that the loop broke, and `ans` will have additional elements from index `temp` to `n-1`.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list of absolute differences between the corresponding elements of a and b for the first i elements of a, and i is either n-1 if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks)**
