Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a`, where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks or `n` if the loop completes all iterations, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks, and `temp` is -1 if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `_` remains a placeholder variable.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `m` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a`, where `i` is either the index at which the loop breaks or `n` if the loop completes all iterations.
- The list `a` remains a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- The list `b` remains a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index at which the loop breaks.
- The variable `temp` will be -1 if the loop completes all iterations, or the index at which the loop breaks.
