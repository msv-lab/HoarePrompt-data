Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list.** 

The variable `ans` is now an empty list, while all other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `temp`) retain their initial values and conditions.
