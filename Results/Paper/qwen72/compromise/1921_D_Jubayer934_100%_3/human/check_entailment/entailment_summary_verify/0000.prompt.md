You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        temp = -1
        ans = []
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        print(sum(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a_i` and `b_i` by comparing each element of `a_i` with the corresponding element of `b_i` and the element at the mirrored position from the end of `b_i`. The function prints the sum of these minimum absolute differences for each test case. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the number of elements in array `b` is exactly equal to the number of elements in array `a`. In such cases, the program incorrectly uses `b[-(n - i)]` to access elements from the end of the array `b`, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
The program will sort `a` to `[1, 2, 3]` and `b` to `[6, 5, 4]`. It will then calculate the differences as follows:
- `abs(1 - 6) = 5`
- `abs(2 - 5) = 3`
- `abs(3 - 4) = 1`

The total difference `D` will be `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`.

However, the correct maximum difference `D` should be:
- `abs(1 - 4) = 3`
- `abs(2 - 5) = 3`
- `abs(3 - 6) = 3`

The total difference `D` should be `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`, but the program does not guarantee that it will always find the optimal arrangement of elements in `b` to maximize `D`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it always uses the largest possible elements from `b` to maximize the difference, regardless of the length of `b`. The correct approach would be to sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, and then pair the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b`, the second smallest element of `a` with the second largest element of `b`, and so on. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
