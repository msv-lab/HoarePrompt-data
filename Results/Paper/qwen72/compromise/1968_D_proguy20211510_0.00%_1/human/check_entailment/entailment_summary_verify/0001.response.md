### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases, the game parameters (n, k, pb, ps), the permutation array `p`, and the score array `a`. This is essential for the program to function correctly.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both Bodya and Sasha are initially on the position with the maximum score (`maxa`). If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya is on the position with the maximum score, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha is on the position with the maximum score, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - These checks are valid because if a player starts on the position with the maximum score, they will always have the highest score if they stay there. This is a correct and efficient way to handle these edge cases.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns. It maintains two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha at each turn.
   - It also uses two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if either player has found the position with the maximum score and decided to stay there.
   - For each turn, it updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the rules of the game.
   - This simulation is correct but could be optimized by detecting cycles in the permutation, as the positions will eventually repeat.

4. **Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the scores for Bodya and Sasha (`preb` and `pres`), which are the cumulative scores up to each turn.
   - This is necessary to keep track of the cumulative scores over the turns.

5. **Optimal Scores:**
   - The program then calculates the optimal scores for Bodya and Sasha (`ptsb` and `ptss`). The optimal score is the score a player can achieve if they stay at the position with the maximum score for the remaining turns.
   - This is done by adding the remaining turns' maximum score to the current cumulative score.
   - This calculation is correct and ensures that the program considers the best possible score a player can achieve.

6. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum optimal scores of Bodya and Sasha (`maxb` and `maxs`).
   - If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, it prints "Sasha".
   - If `maxb` is greater than `maxs`, it prints "Bodya".
   - If `maxs` is equal to `maxb`, it prints "Draw".
   - This logic is correct and follows the rules of the game.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Variables:**
  - The variables `YES`, `NO`, and `alpha` are defined but not used in the program. These can be safely removed.
- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The variable `MOD` is defined but not used in the program. This can also be removed.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns, which could be inefficient for large `k` (up to \(10^9\)). However, since the game is played on a permutation, the positions will eventually cycle, and the program could be optimized to detect cycles and avoid unnecessary simulations.
  - Despite this, the program is still correct for the given problem description and constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the given inputs. The logic is sound and the output is correct for the provided test cases. The issues mentioned are minor and do not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
