### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
   - It then reads the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Finding the Maximum Value in Array \( a \):**
   - The program calculates the maximum value in the array \( a \) and stores it in `maxa`.

3. **Initial Check for Maximum Value:**
   - The program checks if both players start at positions where the value in \( a \) is the maximum.
     - If both players start at positions with the maximum value, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
     - If only Bodya starts at a position with the maximum value, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
     - If only Sasha starts at a position with the maximum value, it prints "Sasha" and continues.

4. **Simulating the Game:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if either player has found the maximum value in \( a \).

5. **Game Loop:**
   - The program runs a loop for \( k \) turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their current positions.
   - If a player is at a position with the maximum value, the flag for that player is set to `True`.
   - If both players have found the maximum value, the remaining turns are filled with the maximum value to optimize the score calculation.

6. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for Bodya and Sasha's scores and stores them in `preb` and `pres`.

7. **Optimized Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the potential scores for each player if they stay at their current position for the remaining turns and stores them in `ptsb` and `ptss`.

8. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program finds the maximum potential score for each player.
   - It compares the maximum scores and prints the winner or "Draw" accordingly.

### Correctness:

- **Initial Checks:**
  - The initial checks for the maximum value in \( a \) are correct and handle the cases where one or both players start at the maximum value.

- **Game Simulation:**
  - The game simulation correctly updates the scores for each player based on their current positions and the permutation \( p \).
  - The optimization for when both players have found the maximum value is correct and ensures that the remaining turns are filled with the maximum value.

- **Prefix Sum and Potential Score Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum calculation is correct and ensures that the scores are accumulated properly.
  - The potential score calculation is correct and considers the remaining turns if a player stays at their current position.

- **Winner Determination:**
  - The winner determination is correct and handles all possible outcomes (Bodya wins, Sasha wins, or Draw).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
