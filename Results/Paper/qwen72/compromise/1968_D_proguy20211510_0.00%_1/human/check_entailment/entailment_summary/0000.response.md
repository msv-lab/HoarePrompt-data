### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly parses the input for `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Check for Maximum Value:**
   - The function checks if both `a[P_B - 1]` and `a[P_S - 1]` are equal to the maximum value in `a`.
   - If both are equal to the maximum value, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only `a[P_B - 1]` is equal to the maximum value, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only `a[P_S - 1]` is equal to the maximum value, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - This initial check is correct because if a player starts at the maximum value, they will always win or draw if the other player also starts at the maximum value.

3. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The function simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It uses two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It uses two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if a player has found the maximum value in `a`.
   - For each turn, it updates the scores based on the current position and the permutation `p`.
   - If a player finds the maximum value, their score is updated to the maximum value for the remaining turns.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the prefix sums for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - This step is necessary to efficiently compute the total score for each player after `k` turns.

5. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by adding the remaining turns' scores to the prefix sums.
   - It then compares the final scores and prints the winner or "Draw" accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `maxa` in Remaining Turns:**
  - The function assumes that once a player finds the maximum value, they will always stay at that position for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily true. The player might move to a different position in the permutation, and the score should be updated based on the new position.
  - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for `k` turns and keep track of the scores without making assumptions about staying at the maximum value.

### Corrected Approach:
- The function should simulate the game for `k` turns without making assumptions about staying at the maximum value.
- For each turn, update the score based on the current position and move to the next position according to the permutation `p`.
- Compare the final scores after `k` turns to determine the winner.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it makes an incorrect assumption about the players staying at the maximum value position for the remaining turns. This assumption can lead to incorrect results in cases where the players move to different positions in the permutation.

**Correctness: False**
