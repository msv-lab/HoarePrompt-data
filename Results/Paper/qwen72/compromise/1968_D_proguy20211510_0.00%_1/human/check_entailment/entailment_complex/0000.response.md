### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The function correctly identifies the maximum value in the array `a` using `maxa = max(a)`.
   - It checks if both players start at positions with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at a position with the maximum value, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at a position with the maximum value, it prints "Sasha" and continues.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The function initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for each turn for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if a player has found a position with the maximum value in `a`.
   - The function simulates the game for `k` turns:
     - If a player has already found a position with the maximum value, their score for subsequent turns is set to the maximum value.
     - If a player has not found a position with the maximum value, their score is updated based on the current position in `a`, and they move to the position specified by `p`.

4. **Prefix Sums:**
   - The function calculates the prefix sums of the scores for Bodya and Sasha using `preb` and `pres`.

5. **Final Scores:**
   - The function calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by adding the remaining turns' scores if they have found a position with the maximum value.
   - It then compares the final scores to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case based on the comparison of the final scores.

### Correctness:
The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the initial conditions, simulates the game for `k` turns, and determines the winner or if it's a draw based on the final scores. The logic and the implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
