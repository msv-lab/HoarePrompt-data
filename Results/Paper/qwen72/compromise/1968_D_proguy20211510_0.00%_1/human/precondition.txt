t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing four elements: n, k, P_B, P_S, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, P_B and P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n. Additionally, for each test case, there are two lists p and a, where p is a permutation of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n values over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
