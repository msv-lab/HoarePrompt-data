arr is a list containing two sublists, where the first sublist represents the array a of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) and the second sublist represents the array b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). Both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order.
