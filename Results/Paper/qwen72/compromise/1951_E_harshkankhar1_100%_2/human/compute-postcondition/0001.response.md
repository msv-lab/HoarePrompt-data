Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is -1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, x = len(s), -1` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the string `s`, and `x` is set to -1. Since `x` was already -1 in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. The value of `n` is now the length of the string `s`, which is consistent with the initial state's condition that `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6).
