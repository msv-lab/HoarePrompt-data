The code snippet provided is simply:
```
print(1)
```
This statement prints the integer `1`.

The initial state includes:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `x` is -1.
- The function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns `False`.

However, none of these variables or the function `func_1` are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement only prints the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
