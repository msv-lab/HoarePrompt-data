Postcondition: **If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1, and the function `func_1` applied to the substring `s[x + 1:]` returns `False`.**
