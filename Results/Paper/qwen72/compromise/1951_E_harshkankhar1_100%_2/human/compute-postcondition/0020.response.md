Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **String `s` and Length `n`**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n`.
   - The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged.

2. **Variable `x`**:
   - If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character.
   - Otherwise, `x` will remain -1.
   - Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1, which means there is at least one character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - The current value of `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`.

3. **Function `func_1(s[x + 1:])`**:
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True` when called with the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides information about the string `s`, the variable `x`, and the function `func_1`, but none of these variables or functions are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `s`, `x`, or the result of `func_1`.

Output: **NO**
