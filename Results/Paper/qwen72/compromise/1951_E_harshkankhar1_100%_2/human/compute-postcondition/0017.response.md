Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` (if such a character exists). Otherwise, `x` remains -1.
   - `x` is not equal to -1, which means there is at least one character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - The function `func_1` applied to the substring `s[x + 1:]` returns `False`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `x` is not -1, there is a character in `s` at index `x` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `s[:x + 1]` will be the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x`.
   - `s[x + 1:]` will be the substring of `s` starting from the character immediately after `x` to the end of the string.
   - The `print` statement will concatenate these two substrings with a space in between.

4. **Output**:
   - The first part of the output will be the substring `s[:x + 1]`, which includes all characters from the start of the string up to and including the first character that is different from `s[0]`.
   - The second part of the output will be the substring `s[x + 1:]`, which includes all characters from the position immediately after `x` to the end of the string.
   - A space will be printed between these two substrings.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **[s[:x + 1]] [s[x + 1:]] (where [s[:x + 1]] is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the first character different from `s[0]`, and [s[x + 1:]] is the substring from the position immediately after `x` to the end of `s`)**
