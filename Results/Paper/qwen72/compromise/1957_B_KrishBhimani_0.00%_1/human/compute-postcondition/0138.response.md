Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 0, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1 and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing the values 1 << i for each i in arr, and if c is equal to n - 1, ans also contains the value k0 - sum(ans). arr is a list of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of k0, starting from 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `_`, `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The variable `c` is equal to `n` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The list `ans` contains the values `1 << i` for each position `i` in the list `arr`, which represents the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`.
- If `c` reaches `n - 1` during the loop, the list `ans` also includes the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k0`.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`.
