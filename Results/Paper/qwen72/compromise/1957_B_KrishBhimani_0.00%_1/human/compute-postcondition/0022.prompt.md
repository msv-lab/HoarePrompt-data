Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while k:
    if k & 1 == 1:
        arr.append(i)
    k = k >> 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must be non-zero, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1. If `k` was an odd number, `arr` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list. `k` is now equal to `k` right-shifted by 1 (i.e., `k` is divided by 2 and the result is floored).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is `k0 // 2`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2. If `k` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is `k0 // 4`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and `k0` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3. If `k` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 2]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
