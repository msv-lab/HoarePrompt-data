Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `c` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`, and `arr` is a list of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`, starting from 0 and must have at least one element. If `c` is `n - 1`, `ans` is [k0] and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`.**
