Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `ans` is an empty list if `c` is not equal to `n - 1`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is equal to `k0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
