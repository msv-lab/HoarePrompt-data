The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is 1, so `1 << 1` is 2. Therefore, 2 is appended to `ans`.

Initial State:
- `_` is 1
- `t` is greater than 0
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`
- `k` is 1
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`
- `i` is 1
- `arr` is [0, 1]
- `c` is 2
- `ans` remains [2] if `c` does not equal `n - 1`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is [2, `k0` - 2], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is now [2, 2] because 2 is appended to the list `ans`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 2, `ans` is [2, 2]**.
