Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least three elements, `c` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` is a list that now includes the value `1 << i` (which is `2` raised to the power of `i`) and the value `k0 - sum(ans)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- The value of `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- The list `ans` initially includes the value `1 << i` (which is `2` raised to the power of `i`).
- The new value appended to `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, where `sum(ans)` is the sum of the current elements in `ans`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
