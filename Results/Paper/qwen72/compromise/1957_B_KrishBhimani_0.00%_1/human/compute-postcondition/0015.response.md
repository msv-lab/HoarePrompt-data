The value of `k` is updated by right-shifting it by 1 bit. This means `k` is divided by 2 and the result is truncated to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `k` will be `k0` right-shifted by 1 bit, which is `k0 // 2`. 

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is `k0 // 2`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1. If `k` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`.**
