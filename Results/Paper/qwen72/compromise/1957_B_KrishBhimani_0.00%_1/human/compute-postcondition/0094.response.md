The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as the loop counter. The loop is controlled by the range of an integer value obtained from the input, which is not a variable that can be adjusted within the loop. Therefore, the only state that can be adjusted is `_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than the integer value obtained from the input.

State: **`_` is 2, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 1, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1, i is 0, arr is [0, 1], c is 3, ans is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`)**
