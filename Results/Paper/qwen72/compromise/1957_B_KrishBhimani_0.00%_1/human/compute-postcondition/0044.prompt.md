Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the element `1 << i` if `c` is not equal to `n - 1`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is equal to `k0` and the element `1 << i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `c` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `c` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` is a list that now includes the value `1 << i` (which is `2` raised to the power of `i`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least three elements, `c` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` now contains the value `1 << i` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
