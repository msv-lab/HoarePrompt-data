The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be an element of `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is [0], and `i` is 1. Since `i` is not in `arr`, the loop will not execute again unless `arr` is modified to include `i` (which is 1).

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and `i` is already set to 1, the only way to make the loop execute again is to ensure that `arr` contains 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 1, `ans` is [2]**
