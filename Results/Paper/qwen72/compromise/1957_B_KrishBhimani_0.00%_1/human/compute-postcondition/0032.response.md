The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still contain at least one element, and `i` must now be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing the element `1 << i` if `c` is not equal to `n - 1`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is equal to `k0` and the element `1 << i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `c` is increased by 1.**
