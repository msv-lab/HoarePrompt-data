Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- Before the code execution, `ans` contains two elements: `1 << i` and `1 << i`.
- The sum of these elements is `2 * (1 << i)`.
- The new element appended to `ans` is `k0 - 2 * (1 << i)`.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains three elements: `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - 2 * (1 << i)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
