You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        arr = []
        
        k0 = k
        
        i = 0
        
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        
        ans = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: _ is t - 1, t is 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 0, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr contains all the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of k0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing the values 1 << i for each i in arr, and if c is equal to n - 1, ans also contains the value k0 - sum(ans), and ans has been extended with (n - len(ans)) zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and returns a result for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
