Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` now contains the first element of `lit`, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, and `x` is updated to the value of `lit[0]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is equal to `y` (both are infinity), `a` contains the first element of `lit` and `b` remains empty. If `x` is less than `y` and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and `b` remains empty or unchanged. If `lit[0]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` contains the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If none of the conditions are met, the lists and variables remain unchanged.***
