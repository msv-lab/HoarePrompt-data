Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least `n + 2` elements, `b` is a list, `i` is `n + 1`, `s` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 1. `n` is the input integer, `cp` and `_` are integers, `_` is incremented by `n`, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.***
