To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`a`**: A list with at least `len(a)` elements. The exact contents of `a` are not specified, so we don't need to consider it further for this task.
2. **`b`**: A list that must have at least `len(b)` elements. The exact contents of `b` are not specified, but we know it has at least one element.
3. **`i`**: This is set to `len(b) - 1`. Since `b` has at least one element, `i` will be the index of the last element in `b`.
4. **`s`**: This is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. The exact value of `s` depends on the contents of `b`.
5. **`n`**: An input integer, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
6. **`lit`**: A list of integers provided by user input, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
7. **`cp`**: Set to 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
8. **`_`**: Remains unchanged, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

Since the exact contents of `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe `s` based on the given information.

Output: **s (where s is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element)**
