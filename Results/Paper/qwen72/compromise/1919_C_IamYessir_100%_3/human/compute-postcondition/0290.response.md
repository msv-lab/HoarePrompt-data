Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.
- The value of `i` is `i + 1` (as per the initial state).
- The value of `n` is still greater than `i + 1`.
- The value of `y` retains its original value, which is either the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` depending on the initial state.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged, which is either the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` depending on the initial state.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The list `lit` remains unchanged.
