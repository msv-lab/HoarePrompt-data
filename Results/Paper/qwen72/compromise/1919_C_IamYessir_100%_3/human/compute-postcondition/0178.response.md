Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[1]`). If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index 1 of `lit` to the end of the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, so `lit[1]` is appended to `a`.
- The value of `x` is updated to the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[1]`.
- The other variables (`b`, `s`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `_`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `x` and `y` are still valid, but `x` is now specifically set to `lit[1]` because `a` is no longer empty.
