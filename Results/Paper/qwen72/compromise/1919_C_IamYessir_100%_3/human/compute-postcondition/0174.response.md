Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[1]`). If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.** 

The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the second element of the list `lit` (since `i` is 1) to the end of the list `a`. The value of `x` is now updated to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
