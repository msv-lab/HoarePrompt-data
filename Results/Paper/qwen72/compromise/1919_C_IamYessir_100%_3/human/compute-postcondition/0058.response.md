Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `lit[i] > x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity.***
