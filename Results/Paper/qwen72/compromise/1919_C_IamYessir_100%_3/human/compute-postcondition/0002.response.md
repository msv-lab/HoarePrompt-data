The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `lit`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers.**
