The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. However, the list `a` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `a` is a typo and should be `lit`, the last element of the `lit` list is assigned to `x`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**
