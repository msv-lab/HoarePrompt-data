Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now contains the first element of `lit`, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, and `x` is updated to the value of `lit[0]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `y`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
