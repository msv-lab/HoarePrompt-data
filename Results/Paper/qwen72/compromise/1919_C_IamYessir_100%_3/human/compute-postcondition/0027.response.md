Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` is a list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, `b` is a list containing the integer `lit[i]`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list containing the integer `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is the last element of `b` (if `b` is non-empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If none of these conditions are met, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, with `x` still being greater than `y` and `y` being less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` being less than or equal to `x`.**
