Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` before the execution, and now `a` includes the `i`-th element of `lit` as its last element. If `len(b) > 0`, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**
