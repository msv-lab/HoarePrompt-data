The function `func` appears to be missing the parameters in its definition based on the provided parameter constraints. Assuming the function should accept the parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` as described:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the elements of the list.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, based on common practices in such functions, it might return some result based on the processing of the list `a` for each test case. Without further details on the output, I will describe the function's parameters and the typical expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in a list), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). The function is expected to process the list `a` for each test case and return a result based on this processing, but the specific output is not provided.**
