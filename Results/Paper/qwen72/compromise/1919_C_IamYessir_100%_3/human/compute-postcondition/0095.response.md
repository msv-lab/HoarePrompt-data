The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a`. The loop will execute if the length of `a` is greater than 1, because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0 (not used in the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 (not used in the loop head)
- `lit` is a list of integers (not used in the loop head)
- `a` is a list of integers
- `b` is a list of integers (not used in the loop head)
- `cp` is 0 (not used in the loop head)
- `i` is `n-1` (this will be adjusted by the loop itself, so we don't need to modify it here)
- `s` is 0 (not used in the loop head)

To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least 2 elements. The variable `i` will be set to 1 by the loop itself on the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
