Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `lit[1] > x`, the list `b` now includes the integer at index 1 of `lit`. If `lit[1] <= x` and `lit[1] > y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[1]`.***
