Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` now includes the integer at index 2 of `lit` as its last element, and if `len(b) > 0`, `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is now the integer at index 2 of `lit`). If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] > y`, the list `a` now includes the integer at index 2 of `lit`. Otherwise, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
