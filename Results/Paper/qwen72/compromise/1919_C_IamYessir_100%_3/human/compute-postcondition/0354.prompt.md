Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if len(a) == 0:
            x = float('inf')
        else:
            x = a[-1]
        if len(b) == 0:
            y = float('inf')
        else:
            y = b[-1]
        if x > y:
            if y >= lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
        elif x == y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif x < y:
            if x >= lit[i]:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the element immediately before it in the list, `b` is a list with at least `len(b)` elements, and the values of `_`, `n`, `lit`, and `cp` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list with at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, and `_` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (excluding the first element of `b`), `n` is the input integer, `cp` and `_` are integers, `_` is incremented by `n`, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
