Output State: **`a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `b` is empty, `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[0]`), and `y` is infinity. `x` is less than `y`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]`).**
