Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing the value `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`.
- Since `a` was initially an empty list, after appending `lit[i]`, `a` now contains the value `lit[i]`.
- The variable `x` is updated to the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[i]`.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `b`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions `x` is less than `y`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y` are still valid.
