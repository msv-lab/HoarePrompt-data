Output State: **`a` is a list with at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1**

The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `lit` to be a list of integers provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged. The user input is split into individual elements, each of which is converted to an integer, and then these integers are stored in the list `lit`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `n`, and `cp` remain as they were in the initial state, and the variable `_` is incremented by 1.
