Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0` or the last element of `b` otherwise, `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value `lit[i]` to the list `b`.
- The values of `a`, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `y` and `x` remain the same as described in the initial state.
- The list `b` now includes the value `lit[i]` at the end.
