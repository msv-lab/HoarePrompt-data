Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`.** 

The value of `b` is updated to include the first element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[0]`). The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is `lit[0]`. The value of `x` remains greater than the current value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
