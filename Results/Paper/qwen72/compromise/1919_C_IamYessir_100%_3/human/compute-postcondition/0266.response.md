Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers. `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` was an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` before the execution. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and the current values of `x` and `y` are equal. The list `a` now includes the integer `lit[i]` as its last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the integer at index `i` of the list `lit` to the end of the list `a`.
- The values of `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, but `x` is still less than or equal to `y`, and `x` and `y` are still equal.
- The list `a` now has an additional element at the end, which is `lit[i]`.
