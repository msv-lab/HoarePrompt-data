Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a list with the second element of `lit` appended to it, if `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit`, if `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the second element of the list `lit` (since `i` is 1) to the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for setting `x` and `y` are still valid, but `y` will now be the last element of `b` because `b` is no longer empty.
