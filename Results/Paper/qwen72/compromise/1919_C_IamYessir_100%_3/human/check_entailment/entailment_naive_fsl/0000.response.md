Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array `a` into subsequences `s` and `t` to minimize the penalty. The logic for appending elements to `a` and `b` is flawed and does not ensure that the penalty is minimized. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty would be to place all elements in one subsequence, resulting in a penalty of 0. However, the program will split the array into `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5]`, resulting in a penalty of 2, which is not the minimum possible penalty.

This indicates that the program does not correctly implement the optimal splitting logic required by the problem description.
