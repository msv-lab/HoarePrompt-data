Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the remaining elements are all set to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}\) and the initial value of `k` minus the first element. `k` is now 0.**

In natural language, the program returns a list `nums` where:
- The first element `nums[0]` is calculated as \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\).
- The remaining elements in the list are all set to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}\) and the initial value of `k` minus the first element.
- The variable `k` is now 0.
