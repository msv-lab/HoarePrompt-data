Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and all other elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\).
- `k.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.
- `1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)` shifts the binary number `1` left by `k.bit_length() - 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}\).
- Subtracting 1 from this value gives \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\).
- All other elements in the list `nums` remain initialized to 0.
