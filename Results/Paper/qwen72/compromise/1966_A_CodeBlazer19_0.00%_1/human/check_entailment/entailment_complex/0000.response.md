Reasoning:

The function `func` is incorrect because it does not perform the required operations to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the exchange operations. Instead, it simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct solution.

To solve the problem correctly, the function should:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. Determine how many cards can be exchanged based on the frequency of each card number and the value of `k`.
3. Calculate the minimum number of cards that cannot be exchanged, which is the remainder of the cards after performing the exchange operations as many times as possible.

The current implementation does not perform these steps and always prints `k - 1`, which is incorrect for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
