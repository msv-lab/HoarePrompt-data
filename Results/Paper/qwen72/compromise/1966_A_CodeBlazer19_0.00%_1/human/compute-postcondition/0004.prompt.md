You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `cards` (1 <= len(cards) <= 100) representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 <= k <= 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 500), `cards` is a list of integers (1 <= len(cards) <= 100), `k` is an integer (2 <= k <= 100). The loop prints `k - 1` for each iteration, but the values of `t`, `cards`, and `k` remain unchanged after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `cards` and an integer `k`. It processes the list of cards by exchanging `k` cards during each operation. The function is designed to be called multiple times within a loop, processing up to 500 test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
