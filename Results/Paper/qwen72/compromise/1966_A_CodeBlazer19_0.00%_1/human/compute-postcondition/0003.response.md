The function `func` accepts two parameters: `cards`, which is a list of integers (1 <= len(cards) <= 100) representing the numbers on the cards, and `k`, which is an integer (2 <= k <= 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `cards` and an integer `k`. It processes the list of cards by exchanging `k` cards during each operation. The function is designed to be called multiple times within a loop, processing up to 500 test cases.**
