Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new lists of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 1. If `len_a` is greater than 3, then `count_a` is 2 or 3 (3 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise 2). If `len_a` is 2 or less, then `count_a` is 0 or 1 (1 if `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0). If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1. If `len_b` is greater than 1 and `b[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_b` is now 2; otherwise, `count_b` is now 1. If `len_b` is greater than 2 and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1, making it 3 if it was 2 before, or 2 if it was 1 before. Otherwise, `count_b` remains as 2 or 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `k`, `count_b` remains unchanged.**
