Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print the result. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read each time string `s` in 24-hour format.
2. **Extracting the Hour and Minute**:
   - The hour `h` is extracted from the first two characters of the string `s`.
   - The minute part is extracted from the last three characters of `s` (i.e., `s[2:]`).
3. **Converting the Hour**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it is converted to `12` (which is correct for 12-hour format).
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it is printed as is.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it is converted by subtracting `12` and then printed with a leading zero if necessary.
4. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - The function uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` and an index based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to `12` to determine if the time should be `AM` or `PM`.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided examples:

- **09:41**:
  - `h = '09'`
  - Since `int(h) <= 12`, it prints `09` followed by `:41 AM`.
- **18:06**:
  - `h = '18'`
  - Since `int(h) > 12`, it prints `06` (i.e., `18 - 12`) followed by `:06 PM`.
- **12:14**:
  - `h = '12'`
  - Since `int(h) <= 12`, it prints `12` followed by `:14 PM`.
- **00:59**:
  - `h = '00'`
  - Since `h == '00'`, it prints `12` followed by `:59 AM`.
- **00:00**:
  - `h = '00'`
  - Since `h == '00'`, it prints `12` followed by `:00 AM`.
- **14:34**:
  - `h = '14'`
  - Since `int(h) > 12`, it prints `02` (i.e., `14 - 12`) followed by `:34 PM`.
- **01:01**:
  - `h = '01'`
  - Since `int(h) <= 12`, it prints `01` followed by `:01 AM`.
- **19:07**:
  - `h = '19'`
  - Since `int(h) > 12`, it prints `07` (i.e., `19 - 12`) followed by `:07 PM`.
- **11:59**:
  - `h = '11'`
  - Since `int(h) <= 12`, it prints `11` followed by `:59 AM`.
- **12:00**:
  - `h = '12'`
  - Since `int(h) <= 12`, it prints `12` followed by `:00 PM`.
- **21:37**:
  - `h = '21'`
  - Since `int(h) > 12`, it prints `09` (i.e., `21 - 12`) followed by `:37 PM`.

All the examples provided in the problem description are correctly converted by the function. The logic and the output format match the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
