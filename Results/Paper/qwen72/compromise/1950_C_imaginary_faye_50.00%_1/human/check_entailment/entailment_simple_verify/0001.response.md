Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is '00', it prints '12' to convert it to 12-hour format. This is correct.
   - If the hour `h` is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is. This is also correct.
   - If the hour `h` is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints it with a leading zero if necessary (using `0{}` format). This is mostly correct, but there is a potential issue with the leading zero format. Specifically, `0{}` will always add a leading zero, even if the hour is a two-digit number after subtracting 12. For example, `13:00` should be `01:00 PM`, but `19:07` will be printed as `07:07 PM` instead of `07:07 PM`.

3. **Minute Handling**: The function prints the minutes `s[2:]` as they are, which is correct.

4. **AM/PM Determination**: The function appends 'AM' if the hour `h` is less than 12, and 'PM' if the hour `h` is 12 or greater. This is correct.

5. **Output Format**: The function ensures that the output format is exactly as specified in the problem description, with the time and AM/PM separated by a space.

However, the issue with the leading zero format needs to be addressed. The current implementation will always add a leading zero, which is incorrect for hours that are already two digits after the subtraction. To fix this, we should use a format that only adds a leading zero when necessary, such as `'{:02d}'.format(int(h) - 12)`.

Let's re-evaluate the function with this in mind:

- **Reading Input**: Correct.
- **Hour Conversion**:
  - For `00:00`, it correctly prints `12:00 AM`.
  - For `09:41`, it correctly prints `09:41 AM`.
  - For `18:06`, it correctly prints `06:06 PM`.
  - For `12:14`, it correctly prints `12:14 PM`.
  - For `21:37`, it incorrectly prints `09:37 PM` instead of `09:37 PM` (the leading zero is unnecessary).

- **Minute Handling**: Correct.
- **AM/PM Determination**: Correct.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not handle the leading zero correctly for hours that are already two digits after the subtraction.

Final: **False**
