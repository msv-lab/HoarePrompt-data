Reasoning:  
The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by calculating the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob construct through their game. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategies of both players. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in the input array `arr`.
2. It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
3. It checks if the current integer `i` appears at least twice in `arr`. If so, it continues to the next integer.
4. If the integer `i` appears exactly once, it increments a counter `cou`.
5. If the counter `cou` reaches 2 (indicating that two distinct integers have appeared exactly once) or if the integer `i` does not appear at all in `arr`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

The logic behind this approach is that Alice and Bob will play optimally to control the MEX. Alice will try to include the smallest integers in `c` that are not already present, while Bob will try to prevent Alice from doing so by removing the smallest integers that are not yet in `c`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the game, the MEX will be the smallest integer that either:
- Does not appear in `arr` at all.
- Appears exactly once in `arr` and is the second unique integer to be added to `c`.

The program correctly identifies this by counting the frequencies of integers and stopping when it finds the first integer that either does not appear or is the second unique integer to appear exactly once.

However, there is a minor issue in the program: it does not handle the case where the loop completes without finding such an index. This should not happen given the problem constraints, but it's good practice to ensure the function always produces an output.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct in its approach and logic, and it will produce the correct output for the given problem description. The only minor improvement would be to ensure that the function always prints a value, even if the loop completes without finding an index (though this should not happen based on the problem constraints).
