### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` of integers.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It correctly increments the count for each integer in `arr` using the loop `for i in arr: freq[i] += 1`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, where Alice and Bob play optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program uses a loop to find the first index `i` where either:
     - `freq[i] == 0` (indicating that `i` is not in `arr` and thus could be the MEX).
     - `cou` (the count of unique elements that appear exactly once) reaches 2, which means Alice and Bob have picked two different unique elements, and the next smallest integer not in `arr` will be the MEX.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through the indices from 0 to `n`.
   - If `freq[i] >= 2`, it continues to the next iteration because the element `i` appears more than once and is not a candidate for the MEX.
   - If `freq[i] == 1`, it increments `cou` because the element `i` appears exactly once.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or `freq[i] == 0`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because:
     - If `cou` reaches 2, it means Alice and Bob have picked two different unique elements, and the next smallest integer not in `arr` will be the MEX.
     - If `freq[i] == 0`, it means the integer `i` is not in `arr` and is the smallest non-negative integer not present, which is the MEX.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` (MEX would be `n`).
   - It also handles the case where `arr` contains repeated elements and only a few unique elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The frequency counting and the loop logic are sound and cover all necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
