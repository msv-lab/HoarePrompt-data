Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new values by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise -1.** 

The initial values of `n` and `k` are no longer relevant as they are reassigned by `func_1()`. The list `arr` is now updated to the list of integers returned by `func_2()`. The value of `pos` remains the same, which is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise -1.
