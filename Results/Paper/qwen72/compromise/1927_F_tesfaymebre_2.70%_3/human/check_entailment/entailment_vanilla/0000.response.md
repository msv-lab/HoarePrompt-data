### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses several functions to read input from `stdin`. These functions are straightforward and seem to handle the input format correctly.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex points to a list of its neighbors.
   - The edges are stored in a list as tuples `(w, u, v)`, where `w` is the weight of the edge, and `u` and `v` are the vertices it connects.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of weight using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`. This is done to ensure that the lightest edge in any cycle is considered last, which is a key part of the algorithm.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program uses a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to keep track of connected components and the minimum edge weight in each component.
   - The `DSU` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to have `find`, `union`, and `min_edge` attributes. The `find` function should return the root of the component, and the `union` function should merge two components and update the minimum edge weight.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles. If `parent_u == parent_v`, it means that adding the edge `(u, v)` would form a cycle.
   - The program then updates the minimum edge weight if the current cycle's minimum edge weight is less than the previously found minimum edge weight.

6. **DFS for Cycle Traversal**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from the node `node_u` and ending at `node_v`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node during the DFS traversal:
     - `0` means the node is unvisited.
     - `1` means the node is being visited (part of the current path).
     - `2` means the node has been fully visited.
   - The function returns the path of the cycle if a cycle is detected.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Edge Sorting**: Sorting the edges in descending order of weight is incorrect. The program should sort the edges in ascending order to ensure that the lightest edge is considered first.
- **Cycle Detection**: The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to detect a cycle correctly. The current condition merges components even when a cycle is detected, which is not the intended behavior.
- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is not correctly handling the cycle detection. It should return the cycle path when a back edge is found, and the current implementation does not ensure that the cycle is correctly identified and returned.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. The edge sorting and cycle detection logic need to be fixed to ensure the program works as intended.

Correctness: **False**
