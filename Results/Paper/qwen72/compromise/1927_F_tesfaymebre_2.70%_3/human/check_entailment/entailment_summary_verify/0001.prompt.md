You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a value from `func_1` and uses this value to determine the number of times `func_6` should be called. After the function concludes, `func_6` has been called `test_cases` times, where `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses several functions to read input from `stdin`. These functions are straightforward and seem to handle the input format correctly.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex points to a list of its neighbors.
   - The edges are stored in a list as tuples `(w, u, v)`, where `w` is the weight of the edge, and `u` and `v` are the vertices it connects.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of weight using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`. This is done to ensure that the lightest edge in any cycle is considered last, which is a key part of the algorithm.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program uses a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to keep track of connected components and the minimum edge weight in each component.
   - The `DSU` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to have `find`, `union`, and `min_edge` attributes. The `find` function should return the root of the component, and the `union` function should merge two components and update the minimum edge weight.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles. If `parent_u == parent_v`, it means that adding the edge `(u, v)` would form a cycle.
   - The program then updates the minimum edge weight if the current cycle's minimum edge weight is less than the previously found minimum edge weight.

6. **DFS for Cycle Traversal**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from the node `node_u` and ending at `node_v`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node during the DFS traversal:
     - `0` means the node is unvisited.
     - `1` means the node is being visited (part of the current path).
     - `2` means the node has been fully visited.
   - The function returns the path of the cycle if a cycle is detected.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Edge Sorting**: Sorting the edges in descending order of weight is incorrect. The program should sort the edges in ascending order to ensure that the lightest edge is considered first.
- **Cycle Detection**: The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to detect a cycle correctly. The current condition merges components even when a cycle is detected, which is not the intended behavior.
- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is not correctly handling the cycle detection. It should return the cycle path when a back edge is found, and the current implementation does not ensure that the cycle is correctly identified and returned.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. The edge sorting and cycle detection logic need to be fixed to ensure the program works as intended.

Correctness: **False**
