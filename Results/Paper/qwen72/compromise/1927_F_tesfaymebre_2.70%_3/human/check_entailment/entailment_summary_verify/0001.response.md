### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses several functions to read input from `stdin`. These functions are straightforward and seem to handle the input format correctly. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to parse different parts of the input, and they appear to be functioning as expected.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex points to a list of its neighbors. This is a standard and efficient way to represent a graph.
   - The edges are stored in a list as tuples `(w, u, v)`, where `w` is the weight of the edge, and `u` and `v` are the vertices it connects. This is also correct.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of weight using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`. This is incorrect. The program should sort the edges in ascending order of weight to ensure that the lightest edge is considered first. Sorting in descending order means that the heaviest edges are considered first, which can lead to incorrect cycle detection and minimum edge weight calculation.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program uses a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to keep track of connected components and the minimum edge weight in each component. The `DSU` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to have `find`, `union`, and `min_edge` attributes.
   - The `find` function should return the root of the component, and the `union` function should merge two components and update the minimum edge weight.
   - The logic in `func_6` for using the DSU is flawed. The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to check if `u` and `v` are already in the same component, which should indicate a cycle. However, the program incorrectly merges the components in this case instead of detecting the cycle.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles. The correct condition should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to detect a cycle. If `parent_u == parent_v`, it means that adding the edge `(u, v)` would form a cycle, and this is the point where the program should detect the cycle and update the minimum edge weight.
   - The current implementation merges components even when a cycle is detected, which is not the intended behavior. This can lead to incorrect cycle detection and minimum edge weight calculation.

6. **DFS for Cycle Traversal**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from the node `node_u` and ending at `node_v`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node during the DFS traversal:
     - `0` means the node is unvisited.
     - `1` means the node is being visited (part of the current path).
     - `2` means the node has been fully visited.
   - The function returns the path of the cycle if a cycle is detected. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the cycle detection. It should return the cycle path when a back edge is found, and the current implementation does not ensure that the cycle is correctly identified and returned.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.
   - Due to the issues in cycle detection and edge sorting, the output may be incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the edge sorting, cycle detection logic, and the DFS function, the program is incorrect. The edge sorting should be in ascending order, and the cycle detection logic should correctly identify cycles without merging components when a cycle is detected. Additionally, the DFS function should correctly return the cycle path.

Final: **False**
