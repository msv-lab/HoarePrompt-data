Output State: **`curr` is a vertex in the graph, `parent` is the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal (or None if `curr` is the root), `path` is a list of vertices representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, the color of `curr` is 2.**

The code changes the color of `curr` from 1 to 2, indicating that the vertex is being processed. The other variables `curr`, `parent`, and `path` remain unchanged from their initial state.
