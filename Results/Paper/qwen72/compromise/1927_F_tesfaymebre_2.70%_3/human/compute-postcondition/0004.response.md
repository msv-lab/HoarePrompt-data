Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a value from `func_1` and uses this value to determine the number of times `func_6` should be called. After the function concludes, `func_6` has been called `test_cases` times, where `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`. The function does not return any value. **
