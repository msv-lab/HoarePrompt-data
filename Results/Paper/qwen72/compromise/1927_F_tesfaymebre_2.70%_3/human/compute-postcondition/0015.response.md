To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that lead to the value of `res`.

### Initial State:
1. **`n` and `m` remain unchanged**: These are constants representing the number of nodes and edges, respectively.
2. **`edges` is a sorted list of `m` tuples in descending order**: Each tuple is of the form `(w, u, v)` where `w` is the weight of the edge, and `u` and `v` are the nodes connected by the edge.
3. **`graph` is a defaultdict of type list**: Each key `u` has a list of values `v` that were appended during the loop iterations. This represents the adjacency list of the graph.
4. **`dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class**: It is initialized with `n + 1` and modified by the union operations. `DSU` is likely a Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) data structure.
5. **`_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were successfully unioned**: This is the smallest edge weight that was successfully added to the graph.
6. **`node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes involved in the union operation that resulted in the minimum edge weight**: These are the specific nodes that were connected by the edge with the minimum weight.
7. **`colors` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all zeros**: This list is used to track the colors of the nodes.
8. **`res` is the result of the `dfs` function call starting from `node_u` with a parent of `-1` and an empty list as the initial path**: `dfs` is a depth-first search function that returns a list of nodes visited starting from `node_u`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Sorting and Union Operations**:
   - The `edges` list is sorted in descending order of edge weights.
   - The union operations are performed on the edges, and the successfully unioned edges are used to build the graph.
   - The minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the nodes `node_u` and `node_v` involved in this union are tracked.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The `graph` is built using the successfully unioned edges. Each node `u` has a list of nodes `v` that it is connected to.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function is called starting from `node_u` with a parent of `-1` and an empty list as the initial path.
   - The `dfs` function will traverse the graph starting from `node_u` and return a list of nodes visited during the traversal.

4. **Output of `dfs`**:
   - The `dfs` function will return a list of nodes that are part of the connected component starting from `node_u`.
   - The `*res` in the `print` statement will unpack this list and print the nodes separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The `print(*res)` statement will print the nodes visited during the depth-first search starting from `node_u`. Since the exact nodes and their connections are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the nodes involved.

Output: **[nodes visited during the DFS starting from node_u] (where node_u is the node involved in the union operation that resulted in the minimum edge weight)**

This output will be a sequence of node indices (integers) separated by spaces, representing the path taken by the DFS starting from `node_u`.
