The function `func_6` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers with the constraint that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). `edges` is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where each tuple represents an edge in a graph, with `w` being the weight of the edge, and `u` and `v` being the vertices connected by the edge, such that 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept these parameters and return a value that is determined by the relationships and constraints between `n`, `m`, and `edges`.
