Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `start` and `target` remain integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `queue` is now empty, indicating that all nodes reachable from `start` have been processed. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `target` was found, the loop returned the distance `dist` from `start` to `target`. If `target` was not found, the loop has finished without returning a distance, and `visited` contains all nodes that were reachable from `start`.**
