Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single element, which is a tuple containing the value of `start` and 0. `visited` is a set containing the value of `start`. `current` is now equal to `start`, and `dist` is now 0. The first element of `queue` has been removed. Additionally, `current` is not equal to `target`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single element, which is a tuple containing the value of `start` and 0. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` contains the values of `start` and `neighbor`. `current` is not equal to `target`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single element, which is a tuple containing the value of `start` and 0. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` contains the values of `start` and `neighbor`. `current` is not equal to `target`. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[start]`. If `neighbor` is in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single element, which is a tuple containing the value of `start` and 0. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` contains the values of `start` and `neighbor`. `current` is not equal to `target`. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[start]`. If `neighbor` is in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
