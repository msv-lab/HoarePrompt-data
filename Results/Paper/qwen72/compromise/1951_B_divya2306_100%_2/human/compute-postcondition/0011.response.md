Output State: **`win_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive) plus the number of elements from `a[k - 1]` to `a[k - 2]` (inclusive) that are also less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` starting from `win_with_swap` or `k - 1` if no such element exists. `wins`, `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged.**
