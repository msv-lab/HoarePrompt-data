To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the count of consecutive 1s at the end of the list.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `s` is a list of integers, but the exact values are not provided.
   - `n` is the count of consecutive 1s at the end of the list `s`.
   - `ans` is calculated by iterating through the list `s` and summing `n + 1` for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - We need to identify sequences of 1s followed by a 0 in the list `s`.
   - For each such sequence, we count the number of consecutive 1s (`n`) and add `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, `ans` will be the sum of all these values.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`.
   - The sequences of 1s followed by a 0 are:
     - `[1, 1, 0]` -> `n = 2`, `n + 1 = 3`
     - `[1, 1, 1, 0]` -> `n = 3`, `n + 1 = 4`
     - `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]` -> `n = 4`, `n + 1 = 5`
     - `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]` -> `n = 5`, `n + 1 = 6`
   - Therefore, `ans = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18`.

5. **General Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `s` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0 in the list s)**
