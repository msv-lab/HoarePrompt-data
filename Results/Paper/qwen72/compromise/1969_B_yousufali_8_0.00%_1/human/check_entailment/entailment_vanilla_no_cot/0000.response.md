Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly parses the input string `s` using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This will only work if the input string contains spaces, which is not the case for binary strings. Instead, it should use `list(map(int, input().strip()))` or simply `input().strip()` to convert the string directly to a list of integers.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Cost**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It counts the number of 1s (`n`) and adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`) whenever a 0 is encountered and `n` is not zero. This does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The correct approach involves finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. This can be done by counting the number of transitions from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1, and then determining the minimum cost based on these transitions.

3. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the result directly, which is not appropriate for handling multiple test cases. The result should be collected and printed after all test cases are processed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    count_1 = 0
    count_0 = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            count_1 += 1
        else:
            count_0 += 1
    if count_1 == 0 or count_0 == 0:
        return 0
    # Count the number of transitions from 1 to 0
    transitions = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '1' and s[i + 1] == '0':
            transitions += 1
    # Check the transition from the last to the first character
    if s[-1] == '1' and s[0] == '0':
        transitions += 1
    # The minimum cost is the number of transitions plus the length of the longest segment of 1s
    return min(n, transitions * 2)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        results.append(min_cost_to_sort(s))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **`min_cost_to_sort(s)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - It first counts the number of 1s and 0s in the string.
   - If the string is already sorted (all 1s or all 0s), the cost is 0.
   - It then counts the number of transitions from 1 to 0.
   - The minimum cost is the number of transitions multiplied by 2, or the length of the string, whichever is smaller.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`, calls `min_cost_to_sort(s)`, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
