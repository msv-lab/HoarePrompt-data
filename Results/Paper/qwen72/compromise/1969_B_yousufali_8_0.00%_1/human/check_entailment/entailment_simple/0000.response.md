Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. However, there are several issues with the provided program that make it incorrect:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` uses `input().split()` to read the binary string, which is incorrect. The `split()` method is used to split a string by whitespace, but the binary string does not contain spaces. It should simply be `input()` or `input().strip()` to read the entire string.

2. **Logic for Counting 1s and 0s**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The variable `n` is used to count the number of 1s, but it is reset to 0 at the beginning of the function. This means that `n` will only count the number of 1s in the current iteration, not the cumulative count. Additionally, the condition `if s[i] == 0 and n != 0` is not correctly implemented to handle the cost calculation for sorting the string.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. The program should calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all 1s to the end of the string. The current implementation does not correctly handle the cost of moving 1s past 0s or the cost of moving the last 1 to the front.

4. **Handling of Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program will not produce the correct output for the test cases.

To fix these issues, the program should:

- Correctly parse the input binary string.
- Use a more appropriate logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string
    n = len(s)
    ones = s.count('1')
    zeros = s.count('0')
    
    # If the string is already sorted, the cost is 0
    if ones == 0 or zeros == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Calculate the cost to sort the string
    cost = 0
    current_ones = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            current_ones += 1
        else:
            cost += current_ones + 1
            current_ones = 0
    
    # If there are 1s at the end of the string, they need to be moved to the front
    if current_ones > 0:
        cost += current_ones
    
    print(cost)

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Parsing**: `input().strip()` is used to read the binary string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - `ones` and `zeros` count the total number of 1s and 0s in the string.
  - If the string is already sorted (all 0s or all 1s), the cost is 0.
  - The program iterates through the string, counting the number of consecutive 1s (`current_ones`). When a 0 is encountered, the cost is incremented by `current_ones + 1` to account for the cyclic shift needed to move the 1s past the 0.
  - If there are 1s at the end of the string, they need to be moved to the front, so the cost is incremented by the number of these 1s.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
