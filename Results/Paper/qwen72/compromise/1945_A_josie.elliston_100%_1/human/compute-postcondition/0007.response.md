Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are between 0 and 10^9 inclusive. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. **
