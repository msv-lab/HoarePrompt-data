### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals.
   - **Case 1:** If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts that cannot form a complete tent of 3 people. In this case, we need to check if the remaining extroverts plus the universals can form a complete tent.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts, so we return `None` (indicating it's impossible).
   - **Case 2:** If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, we can form complete tents with all extroverts, and any remaining universals can be accommodated in the remaining tents.
   - The function returns the ceiling of the total number of people divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by combining the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - **Step 1:** Call `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - **Step 2:** If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so we return `-1`.
   - **Step 3:** If `func_1` returns a valid number, add the number of introverts to this value to get the total number of tents needed.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts need 1 tent, and 1 universal can join to form a complete tent.
     - Universals: 2 universals can form 1 tent.
     - Total: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts + universal) + 1 (universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Example 2:** `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a complete tent.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Example 3:** `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, and 2 universals can join to form complete tents.
     - Total: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Example 4:** `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 1 tent, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a complete tent.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Example 5:** `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts need 1 tent, and 2 universals can form 1 tent.
     - Total: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Example 6:** `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 tents.
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts need 3 tents (2 extroverts + 1 universal in each tent).
     - Universals: 18 - 3 = 15 universals can form 5 tents.
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + universals) + 5 (universals) = 27 tents.
   - **Example 7:** `0 0 0`
     - No participants, so 0 tents.
   - **Example 8:** `7 0 0`
     - Introverts: 7 tents.
     - Total: 7 tents.
   - **Example 9:** `0 24 0`
     - Extroverts: 24 extroverts need 8 tents.
     - Total: 8 tents.
   - **Example 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 tents.
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts need 333333334 tents (1000000000 / 3 = 333333333.33, ceiling is 333333334).
     - Universals: 1000000000 - 333333334 = 666666666 universals can form 222222222 tents.
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + universals) + 222222222 (universals) = 1666666667 tents.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** If `a = 0` and `b = 0`, the number of tents needed is simply the number of universals divided by 3.
   - **Case 2:** If `a > 0` and `b > 0`, we need to ensure that the remaining universals can form complete tents with the extroverts.
   - **Case 3:** If `a = 0` and `b > 0`, we need to ensure that the universals can form complete tents with the extroverts.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound: it checks if the number of extroverts can be divided into complete tents and if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - The logic in `func_2` is also sound: it calls `func_1` and adds the number of introverts to the result, returning `-1` if `func_1` returns `None`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the problem requirements. It ensures that introverts are given separate tents, extroverts are given complete tents, and universals are used to fill the remaining spots in the tents.

Final: **True**
