#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The function will print "NO" for odd values of n and for even values of n where the length of the generated string exceeds 200. For even values of n where the length of the generated string is less than or equal to 200, the function will print "YES" followed by the generated string. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the loop will have completed all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input. If `n` is odd or if the length of the generated string (which is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times) exceeds 200, the function prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input `t` will have been processed, and the loop will have completed all iterations.
