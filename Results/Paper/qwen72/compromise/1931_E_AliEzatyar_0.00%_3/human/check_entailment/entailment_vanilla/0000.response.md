Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Zero Handling:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0, which will store the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes `zeros` as an empty list, which will store the number of trailing zeros in each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros` if the count is greater than 0.

3. **Trailing Zero Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer (represented as a string).

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted `zeros` list in steps of 2, summing up the values at even indices to `subtract_zero`.
   - The idea here is to simulate Anna's optimal strategy of reversing integers with trailing zeros, which can potentially reduce the number of digits that Sasha can use to form a large number.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to "Sashah" (which should be "Sasha").
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to "Anna".

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

**Issues:**
- **Typo in Output:** The program sets the answer to "Sashah" instead of "Sasha". This is a critical error as it will cause the output to be incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
- The program has a typo in the output, which makes it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
