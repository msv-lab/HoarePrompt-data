Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the standard input, and for each iteration up to the number specified by this integer, it calls the `solve()` function. The function does not return any value. The state of any other variables not affected by the loop or the `solve()` function calls remains unchanged. **
