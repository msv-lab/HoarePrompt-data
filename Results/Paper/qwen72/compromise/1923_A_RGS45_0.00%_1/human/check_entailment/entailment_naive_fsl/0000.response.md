Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple chips and free cells between them, and the optimal solution involves moving chips from both ends towards the center. Specifically, the program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is not always the minimum number of operations required.

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The expected output is `2`, because you can move the chips at positions 1 and 5 to the center to form a single block. However, the program will output `3` because it counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is `3`.

This indicates that the program is not correctly implementing the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.
