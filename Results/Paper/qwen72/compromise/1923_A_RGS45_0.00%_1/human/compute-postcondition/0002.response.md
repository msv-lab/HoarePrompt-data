Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the list of cells. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be re-assigned for each iteration based on the input provided for that test case. After the loop finishes, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the values from the last test case processed.**
