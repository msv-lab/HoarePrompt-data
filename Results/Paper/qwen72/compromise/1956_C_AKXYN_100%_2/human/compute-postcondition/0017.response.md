Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1.
   - `i` is n-2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is `'2 %d' % i`. This is a formatted string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This unpacks the range of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Values:**
   - `i` is given as `n-2`.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The formatted string `'2 %d' % i` will be `'2 ' + str(n-2)`.
   - The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)` will be the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
```
2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... [n]
```

Where `[n-2]` is the value of `n-2` and `[n]` is the value of `n`.

Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and [n] is the value of n)**
