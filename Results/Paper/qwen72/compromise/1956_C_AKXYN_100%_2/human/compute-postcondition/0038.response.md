Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is `'1 %d' % i`. This is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and `i` is the integer value to be inserted. Since `i` is defined as `n - 1`, the formatted string will be `'1 n-1'`.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The value of `i` is `n - 1`.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will produce the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- The string `'1 n-1'` followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n-1 is the value of n-1 and the sequence 1 2 3 ... n is the range from 1 to n inclusive)**
