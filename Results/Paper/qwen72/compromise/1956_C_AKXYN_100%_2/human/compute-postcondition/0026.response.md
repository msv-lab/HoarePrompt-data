The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0, which it already is.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `res` is 0
- `i` is 0

The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. Since `i` is already 0, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
