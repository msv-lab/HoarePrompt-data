Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 14, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value.
- Given `i` is 2, the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`.
- Therefore, `res` is updated from 7 to 7 + 15 = 14.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.
