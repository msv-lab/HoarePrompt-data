Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is \(n - 2\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The print statement uses the format string `'2 %d'` and the value of `i` to print the first part.
   - `i` is defined as \(n - 2\). Therefore, the first part of the print statement will be `'2 %d' % (n - 2)`, which will print `2` followed by the value of \(n - 2\).
   - The second part of the print statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive of `n + 1`), which means it will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first part of the output will be `2` followed by the value of \(n - 2\).
   - The second part of the output will be a space-separated list of integers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [n-2] is the value of \(n - 2\) and [n] is the value of `n`)**
