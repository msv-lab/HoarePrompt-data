Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is \(n - 2\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is `'1 %d' % i`. Here, `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - `i` is defined as \(n - 2\). Therefore, the value of `i` will be \(n - 2\).
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) into individual elements.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first part of the print statement will be `'1 %d' % (n - 2)`, which will be formatted as `'1 (n - 2)'`.
   - The second part will be the unpacked range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), which will be the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'1 (n - 2)'` followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 (n - 2) 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and (n - 2) is the value of i)**
