Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by maximizing the sum of all the numbers in the n×n matrix using no more than 2n operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix and Result Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a matrix `mat` with rows from 1 to n.
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum `res` using the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\). This formula is derived from the fact that each row and each column will be filled with the permutation of integers from 1 to n, and the sum of each permutation is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). Since there are n rows and n columns, the total sum is \(n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).

3. **Outputting the Result**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `2n` (since it performs 2 operations per row).
   - It then prints the operations:
     - For each row `i` from `n` to `1`, it performs a Type 1 operation to set the row to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - For each column `i` from `n` to `1`, it performs a Type 2 operation to set the column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - Each Type 1 operation sets a row to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and each Type 2 operation sets a column to the same permutation.
   - Since each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, the sum of the matrix is maximized.
   - The number of operations is exactly `2n`, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 1`, the matrix is `[1]`, and the sum is `1`. The program outputs `1 1` and performs one Type 1 operation.
   - For `n = 2`, the matrix can be filled as follows:
     - After the first Type 1 operation on row 1: `[[1, 2], [0, 0]]`
     - After the second Type 1 operation on row 2: `[[1, 2], [1, 2]]`
     - After the first Type 2 operation on column 1: `[[1, 2], [1, 2]]`
     - After the second Type 2 operation on column 2: `[[1, 2], [1, 2]]`
   - The sum of the matrix is `1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7`, which is the maximum possible sum for a 2×2 matrix.

Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
