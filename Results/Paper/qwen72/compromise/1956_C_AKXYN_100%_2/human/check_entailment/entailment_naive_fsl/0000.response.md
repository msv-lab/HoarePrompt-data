Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all potential cases. Specifically, the program constructs the matrix and calculates the sum but does not perform the operations as described in the problem statement. The operations should be of type 1 or type 2, and the program should output the operations that lead to the maximum sum. However, the program simply prints the operations in a fixed pattern without ensuring that they actually maximize the sum.

For example, consider the case where \( n = 2 \):

- The program outputs:
  ```
  7 4
  1 2 1 2
  2 2 1 2
  1 1 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```

- The operations are:
  1. Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [1, 2]
  2. Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation [1, 2]
  3. Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [1, 2]
  4. Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [1, 2]

However, these operations do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. The correct operations to maximize the sum for \( n = 2 \) could be:
  1. Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [2, 1]
  2. Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [2, 1]
  3. Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [2, 1]
  4. Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation [2, 1]

This would result in a matrix:
```
2 1
2 1
```
with a sum of 6, which is not the maximum possible sum of 7. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
