The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 10,000, the function prints `1` and `16668` and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list of integers by at least one. The function prints the number of operations for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
