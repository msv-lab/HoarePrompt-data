Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.** 

The list `b` now contains the elements of `a` in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
