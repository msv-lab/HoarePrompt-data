The code snippet `new_median = b[ma]` updates the value of `new_median` to the value of `b[ma]`. Before this update, `new_median` was `median + 2`, and `b[ma]` was `median + 3`. After the update, `new_median` will be equal to `b[ma]`, which is `median + 3`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 3, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is `median + 3`, `b[ma]` is now `median + 3`.**
