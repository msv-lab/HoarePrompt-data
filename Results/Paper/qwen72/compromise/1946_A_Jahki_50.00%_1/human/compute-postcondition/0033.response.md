The code snippet `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was already a sorted version of the list `a`, sorting it again does not change its contents. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 3, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the increment, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` and is equal to `median + 1`.**
