Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.

Explanation: The variable `ma` is assigned the value of `int(num2 / 2)`, which means `ma` is the integer division of `num2` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
