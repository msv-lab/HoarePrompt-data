To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is an input string.
- `op` is 0.
- If `num2` > 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`.
- `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.
- `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd.
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the loop started.
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` and is greater than `median`.
- `op` is the number of times the loop has executed.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(0, num):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `num`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- `num` is greater than 0.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `num`.

### Conclusion:
- `i` should be incremented to 1.
- `num` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0. If `num2` > 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the loop started, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` and is greater than `median`, and `op` is the number of times the loop has executed.**
