To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- `num` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is the new input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`
- `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]`
- `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`

The loop condition is `new_median <= median`. For the loop to execute, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.

Since `new_median` and `median` are both set to the same value (`b[ma]`), the condition `new_median <= median` is always true. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`**
