The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `num`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `num` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `num` must still be greater than `i` (so `num` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0. If `num2` > 10000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case`, `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before any iterations, `new_median` is `median + op`, and `b[ma]` is now `median + op`.**
