To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case`
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- `num` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is the new input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
- `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]`
- `new_median` is equal to `median`

From the given state, `new_median` is already equal to `median`. Therefore, the condition `new_median <= median` is true, and the loop will execute at least once without any adjustments.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is equal to `median`**
