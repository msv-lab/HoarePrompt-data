Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key insight here is that if at least one side of the original rectangle is even, then Bob can always cut the rectangle in such a way that he can form a different rectangle. This is because an even side can be divided into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

1. **Even Side Condition**: If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle along the even side into two smaller rectangles, each with one side being half of the original even side. These two smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.

2. **Odd Side Condition**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle by cutting it. Cutting an odd side will always result in two smaller rectangles with at least one odd side, and rearranging these will not produce a new rectangle with different dimensions. For example, a 3x3 rectangle can only be cut into two 3x1 or 1x3 rectangles, and these can only be rearranged to form the original 3x3 rectangle or a rotated version of it, which is considered the same.

The provided program checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This logic correctly implements the reasoning described above.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
