The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not carry any specific state that needs to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0**
