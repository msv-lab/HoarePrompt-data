Reasoning:

The program provided in the solution is not entirely correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this logic is incomplete and does not fully capture the conditions under which Bob can form a different rectangle.

To determine if Bob can form a different rectangle, we need to consider the following:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle**: Bob can cut the rectangle either along the length `a` or the width `b` to produce two smaller rectangles.
2. **Forming a New Rectangle**: After cutting, Bob should be able to form a new rectangle that is different from the original `a x b` rectangle. This means the new rectangle should have a different aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of its sides should be different from the original).

Let's analyze the conditions:

- If Bob cuts the rectangle along the length `a`, he will get two rectangles of size `a x (b // 2)`. To form a new rectangle, he can place these two rectangles side by side to get a rectangle of size `2a x (b // 2)`. This new rectangle will be different from the original `a x b` if `2a != b` and `a != 2 * (b // 2)`.
- If Bob cuts the rectangle along the width `b`, he will get two rectangles of size `(a // 2) x b`. To form a new rectangle, he can place these two rectangles side by side to get a rectangle of size `(a // 2) x 2b`. This new rectangle will be different from the original `a x b` if `2b != a` and `b != 2 * (a // 2)`.

However, the provided function only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if a different rectangle can be formed. For example, for the input `2 1`, the function returns 'no' because `b` is odd, but this is incorrect because `2 x 1` cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a different rectangle.

A correct approach would be to check if either `a` or `b` is even and if the resulting cut can form a different rectangle. Specifically, the condition should be:
- If `a` is even, check if `a // 2` is not equal to `b`.
- If `b` is even, check if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even and does not consider the full conditions required to form a different rectangle.

Correctness: **False**
