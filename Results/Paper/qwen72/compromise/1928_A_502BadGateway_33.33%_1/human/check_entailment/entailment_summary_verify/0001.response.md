Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a new rectangle that is different from the original, considering rotations as the same.
2. **Cutting the Rectangle**: A rectangle can be cut parallel to one of its sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles. The cut must be along a side, and since the sides are integers, the cut will result in two rectangles with integer sides.
3. **Reassembling the Rectangles**: After cutting, the two smaller rectangles can be reassembled in different ways. The key is to check if the reassembled rectangle is different from the original.
4. **Condition for Reassembly**: For the reassembled rectangle to be different from the original, at least one of the dimensions of the smaller rectangles must be different from the original dimensions. This means that if the original rectangle is \(a \times b\), and we cut it into two rectangles, the new dimensions must allow for a different combination.
5. **Mathematical Insight**: If the original rectangle has one side that is even, it can be cut into two smaller rectangles with one side being half of the even side. These two smaller rectangles can then be reassembled to form a new rectangle with a different aspect ratio.
6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function `func_1` checks if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is even, it returns "yes"; otherwise, it returns "no".
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

7. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies if the rectangle can be cut and reassembled into a different rectangle by checking if \(b\) is even.
   - However, it only checks if \(b\) is even, not if \(a\) is even. This is a mistake because if \(a\) is even, the same logic applies (i.e., the rectangle can be cut and reassembled into a different rectangle).
   - For example, a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and reassembled into a \(6 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it only checks one dimension for evenness, while it should check both dimensions.

Final: **False**
