### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Grid Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of the grid for each test case.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in a list `a`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the grid is a single row or a single column by checking the first and last elements of the first and last rows.
   - It also checks if the first and last rows are entirely the same color but different from each other, which would make it impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if the first and last rows are entirely the same color but different from each other. If this is the case, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - It also checks if the first and last columns are entirely the same color but different from each other. If this is the case, it prints "NO" for the same reason.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES" because it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The key insight is that if the first and last rows (or columns) are entirely the same color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because any operation that changes the color of one of these rows (or columns) will not affect the other.
   - If the first and last rows (or columns) are not entirely the same color or are the same color, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently checks the conditions by using set operations, which are O(1) for checking the length of the set.
   - The overall complexity is O(n * m) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing the allowed operations. The edge cases and main logic are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
