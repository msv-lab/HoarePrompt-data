The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3 (since the loop starts from 1 and the next value after 2 is 3), and `n` must still be greater than 0.

However, the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` does not affect the loop head, so we do not need to adjust `sum` or `r` in the state at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` and `r` is 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` is `n + i * n` and `r` is 0.**
