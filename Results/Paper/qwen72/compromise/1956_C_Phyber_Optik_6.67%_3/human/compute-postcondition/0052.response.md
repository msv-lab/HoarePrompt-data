Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `sum` is `n * n`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to it. Since `i` is `n`, the new value of `sum` is `n * n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
