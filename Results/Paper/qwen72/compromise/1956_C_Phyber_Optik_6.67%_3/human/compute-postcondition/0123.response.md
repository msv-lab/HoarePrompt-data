To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 2.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

### Current State:
- `j` is 2.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `r` is `n`.

### Adjustments:
- **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 3.
- **`n` and `r`**: These variables are not modified by the loop head, so they remain the same.

### New State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 3.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` remains the same as described in the given state.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, `r` is `n`, and `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.**
