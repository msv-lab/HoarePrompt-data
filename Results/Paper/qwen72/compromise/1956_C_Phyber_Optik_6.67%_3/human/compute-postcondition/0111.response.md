Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
2. `n` is a positive integer.
3. `i` is `n + 1`.
4. `j` is 1.
5. `r` is `n`.
6. `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n. Additionally, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing three values: `1`, `j`, and an empty string with a space at the end (`end=' '`).
- The value of `1` is a constant integer.
- The value of `j` is explicitly given as 1 in the initial state.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the values `1` and `j` (which is 1), followed by a space.
Output: **1 1 **
