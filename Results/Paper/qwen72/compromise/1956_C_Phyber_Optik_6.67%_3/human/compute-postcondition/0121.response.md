To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 2.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- The value of `n` is a positive integer, so the range will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**
