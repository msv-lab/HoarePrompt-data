Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is `n`, and `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable `j` will have completed its range and will be equal to `n + r` (which is `2n` since `r` is `n`). The value of `sum` is determined by the conditions specified in the initial state and does not change as a result of the loop execution. The loop itself prints different values based on whether `j` is less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, but these print statements do not affect the state of the variables.
