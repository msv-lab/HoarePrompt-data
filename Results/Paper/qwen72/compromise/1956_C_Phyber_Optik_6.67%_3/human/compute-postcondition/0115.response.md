Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 1.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
- Additionally, `j` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Function**: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. **Print Statement**: The `print` function with the `*` operator unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` and prints each integer separated by a space.

### Variables:
- `n` is a positive integer, so `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**

This output is a sequence of integers starting from 1 and ending at `n`, with each integer separated by a space. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is a positive integer.
