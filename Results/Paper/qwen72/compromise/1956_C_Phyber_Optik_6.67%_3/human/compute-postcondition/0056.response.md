Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1`, and `sum` is `n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value.
- The current value of `sum` is `n * n`.
- After the update, `sum` becomes `n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `r`) remain unchanged.
