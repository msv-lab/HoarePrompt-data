Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 2.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the sequence, so the `print` statement will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `n` is a positive integer, the range will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
- The `print` statement will output these integers separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**

This means the output will be a sequence of integers starting from 1 and ending at `n`, with each integer separated by a space. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is a positive integer.
