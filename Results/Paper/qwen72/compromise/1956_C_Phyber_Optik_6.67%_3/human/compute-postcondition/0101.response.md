Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is either 0 or 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `j` is `n + 2`, `r` is 2, and `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `sum` is `n + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.***
