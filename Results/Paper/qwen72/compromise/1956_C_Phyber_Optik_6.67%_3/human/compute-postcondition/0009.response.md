The value of `sum` is incremented by the product of `i` and `n`. The initial value of `sum` is 0, and `i` is 1, so `sum` becomes `n`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is `n`, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.**
