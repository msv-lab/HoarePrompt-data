Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum possible sum of the matrix is achieved when every element in the matrix is the maximum possible value, which is \( n \). Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

The provided program, however, does not correctly compute the maximum sum or the operations needed to achieve it. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The program uses a loop to compute the sum, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. It attempts to add the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to the total sum if a condition is met, and otherwise adds \( i \times n \). This does not correspond to the maximum possible sum of the matrix.

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations**:
   - The program prints \( n + r \) operations, where \( r \) is determined by a condition inside the loop. This does not guarantee that the number of operations will be no more than \( 2n \).

3. **Incorrect Operation Types and Values**:
   - The program prints operations of type 1 for the first \( n \) iterations and operations of type 2 for the remaining \( r \) iterations. The values and permutations printed do not align with the problem's requirements for maximizing the sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Compute the maximum sum as \( n^3 \).
- Print exactly \( 2n \) operations, alternating between row and column operations, each using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to ensure all elements are set to \( n \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(n, 0, -1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(n, 0, -1))
```

Given the issues in the provided program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
