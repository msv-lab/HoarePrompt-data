### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \). Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n^3 \).

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - The correct approach to maximize the sum is to fill the entire matrix with the value \( n \).
   - This can be done by performing \( n \) Type 1 operations to set each row to the permutation \( [n, n, \ldots, n] \) and \( n \) Type 2 operations to set each column to the permutation \( [n, n, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each \( i \), it checks if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is greater than \( i \times n \).
     - If true, it sets \( r \) to \( i \) and adds \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) to \( \text{sum} \).
     - If false, it adds \( i \times n \) to \( \text{sum} \).
   - It then prints \( \text{sum} \) and \( n + r \) as the number of operations.
   - It prints \( n + r \) operations:
     - For the first \( n \) operations, it prints Type 1 operations, setting each row \( j \) to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - For the next \( r \) operations, it prints Type 2 operations, setting each column \( j \% n \) to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) is incorrect. The maximum sum should be \( n^3 \), but the code does not achieve this.
   - The number of operations \( n + r \) is not necessarily the correct number of operations to maximize the sum.
   - The operations themselves are not optimal for maximizing the sum. Filling the matrix with permutations of \( 1 \) to \( n \) does not necessarily maximize the sum.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the program is attempting to fill the matrix with permutations of \( 1 \) to \( n \), which is not the optimal approach.
   - The state of the program at the end of each test case is not aligned with the goal of maximizing the sum to \( n^3 \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as required by the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
