### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func()` is defined to solve a problem involving input strings and counting occurrences of the character '1'.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (which is not used in the logic) and a string `a`.

3. **Counting '1's**:
   - It counts the number of '1's in the string `a` using `a.count('1')`.

4. **Condition Checks**:
   - If the count of '1's is `0`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If the count of '1's is greater than `2` and the count is even, it prints 'YES'.
   - If the count of '1's is exactly `2`, it checks if the two '1's are adjacent. If they are not adjacent, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - For all other cases, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Logical Flow**:
   - The function correctly handles the different conditions based on the count of '1's.
   - The adjacency check for exactly two '1's is also correctly implemented.

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The function reads input from `input()` and prints the result to the console, which is consistent with typical problem-solving in competitive programming or similar contexts.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when the count of '1's is `0` or when there are exactly two '1's that are not adjacent.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is logically correct and handles all the specified conditions as described in the problem. There are no apparent issues with the code.

### Correctness:
**True**
