### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**:
   - The function `func` does not take any parameters and does not return any value.
   - It reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `a` from the user input.
   - The variable `n` is not used in the function, which is fine if it is not needed for the logic.

3. **Count '1's in the String**:
   - The function counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `a` using `a.count('1')`.

4. **Conditional Checks**:
   - If the count of '1's is 0, it prints 'YES'.
   - If the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'.
   - If the count of '1's is exactly 2 and the two '1's are not adjacent, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **State After Function Execution**:
   - The variables `start` and `end` are not modified by the function, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - The variables `n`, `a`, and `count` are redefined in each iteration of the loop and are undefined after the loop, which is expected behavior.

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The function reads input from the user and prints the result for each test case, which is the intended behavior.

### Correctness:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It handles all the specified conditions and prints the correct output for each test case. The state of the program before and after the function call is consistent with the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
