### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is defined with two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are expected to be integers.
   - The problem description states that `start` and `end` are integers where `0 <= start <= end`.

2. **Current Directory and Subfolders:**
   - The function correctly uses `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory.
   - It then uses `os.scandir(current_dir)` to list all entries in the current directory and filters out only the directories using `if f.is_dir()`.
   - The subfolders are stored in the list `subfolders`.

3. **Folder Name Check:**
   - For each subfolder, the function checks if the folder name is a digit and if it falls within the specified range `[start, end]`.
   - This is done using `folder_name.isdigit()` and `start <= int(folder_name) <= end`.

4. **HTML File Generation:**
   - If the folder name is within the range, the function lists all `.html` files in that folder using `os.listdir(folder)`.
   - It then prints the number of HTML files in the folder.
   - For each HTML file, it generates two new files: one with `-ac.py` appended to the base name and another with `-wa.py` appended.
   - These files are created using `open(ac_file, 'w').close()` and `open(wa_file, 'w').close()`.
   - The function prints the paths of the generated files.

5. **Main Block:**
   - The main block specifies the range `start_range = 1951` and `end_range = 1980`.
   - It calls the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start_range, end_range)`.

6. **Annotated Program:**
   - The annotated program is unrelated to the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. It appears to be a separate program that reads input and processes it to determine if a string meets certain conditions.
   - The annotated program does not affect the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

### Conclusion:
The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function correctly implements the problem description. It checks the folder names, lists HTML files, and generates the required files. The annotated program is not part of the function and does not impact its correctness.

### Correctness:
**True**
