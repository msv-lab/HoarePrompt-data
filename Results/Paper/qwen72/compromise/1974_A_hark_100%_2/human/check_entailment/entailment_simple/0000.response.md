### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Logic for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 of the 2x2 icons (since a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and a screen has 15 cells, the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen is 2).
   - This value is stored in `bxsfory`.

3. **Logic for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program then calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. It does this by subtracting the space occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total space available on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is intended to adjust the number of 1x1 icons based on the space left after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be `x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining space on the screen is `15 - 4 * (y // 2)`.
   - The program then calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)` and stores it in `bxsfory1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct.
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is correct.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0, which is correct.

5. **Error in the Formula**:
   - The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x - bxsfory * 11` to correctly account for the space occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - This error can lead to incorrect results for some test cases, especially when `x` is large and `y` is non-zero.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the formula used to calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. This can result in incorrect output for some test cases.
