Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens needed for the icons. Specifically, the calculation for `x` after accounting for the 2x2 icons is incorrect. The program subtracts the number of 2x2 icons that can fit in one screen (multiplied by 15, which is the total number of 1x1 cells in a screen) from `x`, but it should instead subtract the number of 1x1 cells that are occupied by the 2x2 icons (which is 4 cells per 2x2 icon).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)  # Number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
            x = x - bxsfory * 4  # Subtract the number of 1x1 cells occupied by 2x2 icons
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)  # Number of screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))  # Only 2x2 icons, so calculate screens needed for them
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))  # Only 1x1 icons, so calculate screens needed for them
        else:
            print(0)  # No icons, so no screens needed

func_1()
```

This corrected version properly accounts for the space occupied by the 2x2 icons and then calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The original program incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x`, which would imply that each 2x2 icon occupies 15 cells, which is not correct. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so the correct adjustment is `x = x - bxsfory * 4`.
