You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a pair of integers (n, k) and a list of integers a. For each test case, it calculates the number of ships that can be completely destroyed by the Kraken, given that the Kraken can perform up to k attacks. The function reads the input for each test case, updates the durability of the ships by simulating the attacks, and prints the number of ships that have been reduced to zero durability. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of test cases `T` is 0, and the final state of the program includes the updated list of ship durabilities `a`, the indices `l` and `r` indicating the positions of the first non-zero elements from the left and right respectively, and the count `ans` of ships that have been destroyed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the Kraken attacks the ships an odd number of times and the remaining ships are not evenly distributed. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the scenario where the Kraken attacks the last ship and then the first ship, but the remaining attacks are not enough to sink both ships.

Example Input:
```
1
4 3
1 2 4 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this example, the Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0, and then attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 2. The Kraken then attacks the first ship again, but it has already sunk. The program incorrectly counts the last ship as sunk because it does not properly handle the remaining attacks when the number of attacks is odd.
