Output State: **`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 unless `a[0]` is 0, in which case `l` is 1 or 2 if `a[l]` was 0. `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2`. `ans` is 1 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2 or 3 if `a[l]` was 0. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**
