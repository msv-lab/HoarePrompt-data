Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is incremented by 1, `ans` is now 1, 2, or 3, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, and `k` is now `k - (mi * 2)`. Otherwise, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, and `k` is now `k - (mi * 2)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so if `r` was `n - 1`, it is now `n - 2`. If `r` was `n - 2`, it is now `n - 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
