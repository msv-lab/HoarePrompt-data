Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[l]` is decremented by `mi`, which is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
