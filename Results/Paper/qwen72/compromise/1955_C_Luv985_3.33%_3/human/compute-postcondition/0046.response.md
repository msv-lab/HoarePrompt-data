Postcondition: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
