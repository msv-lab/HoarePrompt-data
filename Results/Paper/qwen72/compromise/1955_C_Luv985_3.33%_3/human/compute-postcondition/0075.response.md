Output State: **`T` is 0, `n` is an integer converted from the first string from the input, `k` is an integer converted from the second string from the input, `a` is a list of strings from the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `T` is 0, `n` is an integer converted from the first string from the input, and `k` is an integer converted from the second string from the input.
- The code `a = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to `a`.
- The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `a` is a list of strings derived from the input.
