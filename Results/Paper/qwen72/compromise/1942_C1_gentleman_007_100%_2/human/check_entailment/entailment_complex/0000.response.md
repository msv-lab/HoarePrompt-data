### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with `n` sides, using `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and up to `y` additional vertices chosen by you. In this version, `y = 0`, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to count the number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie. The initial count is `x - 2` because a triangle can be formed by choosing 3 vertices, and the remaining vertices can form additional triangles.
   - The program then checks for specific conditions where additional triangles can be formed:
     - If two consecutive chosen vertices are 2 units apart, an additional triangle can be formed.
     - If the last chosen vertex is `n - 1` and the first chosen vertex is `1`, an additional triangle can be formed.
     - If the last chosen vertex is `n` and the first chosen vertex is `2`, an additional triangle can be formed.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - It then reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

5. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 to Function 18**: These functions are not directly used in the main logic of the program. They are either helper functions or unused in the context of this problem.
   - **Function 19**: This function is not used in the main logic and is incomplete (returns `mid` which is not defined).
   - **Function 20**: This function is not used in the main logic and is for computing the integer part of the square root of a number.
   - **Function 21**: This function is not used in the main logic and is for modular exponentiation.
   - **Function 22**: This function is not used in the main logic and is for computing the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two lists.
   - **Function 23**: This function is not used in the main logic and is for finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a list.
   - **Function 24 and Function 25**: These functions are not used in the main logic and are for depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) in a graph, respectively.

6. **Main Program**:
   - The main program correctly initializes the number of triangles as `x - 2`.
   - It correctly checks for additional triangles based on the conditions provided.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The main logic of the program is correct and meets the problem description. The additional functions are not used in the main logic and do not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem.

**Correctness: **True****
