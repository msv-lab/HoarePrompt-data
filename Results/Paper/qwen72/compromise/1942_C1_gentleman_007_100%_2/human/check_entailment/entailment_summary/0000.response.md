### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by cutting diagonals from a subset of vertices in a regular polygon. Given the constraints, particularly \( y = 0 \), we can only use the vertices that Bessie has already chosen.

The provided code snippet is a part of the solution and is responsible for processing each test case. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) (where \( y \) is always 0).
   - It reads the \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie and stores them in a list `arr`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles is set to \( x - 2 \). This is because a polygon with \( x \) vertices can be divided into \( x - 2 \) triangles by connecting all vertices with diagonals.

3. **Additional Triangle Calculation:**
   - The code then checks for additional triangles that can be formed by considering the vertices in `arr`:
     - It checks if there are any pairs of consecutive vertices in `arr` that are exactly two positions apart (i.e., \( \text{arr}[i-1] + 2 = \text{arr}[i] \)). If such pairs exist, it increments the triangle count by 1 for each pair.
     - It also checks for specific edge cases where the last vertex in `arr` is \( n - 1 \) and the first vertex is 1, or the last vertex is \( n \) and the first vertex is 2. These edge cases can form additional triangles, and the triangle count is incremented accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - The code prints the maximum number of triangles that can be formed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Initial Triangle Count:**
  - The initial triangle count \( x - 2 \) is correct because a polygon with \( x \) vertices can be divided into \( x - 2 \) triangles by connecting all vertices with diagonals.

- **Additional Triangle Count:**
  - The additional triangle count checks for pairs of vertices that are exactly two positions apart. This is a valid approach because such pairs can form additional triangles.
  - The edge cases where the last vertex is \( n - 1 \) and the first vertex is 1, or the last vertex is \( n \) and the first vertex is 2, are also correctly handled. These edge cases account for the possibility of forming additional triangles that wrap around the polygon.

- **Constraints and Validity:**
  - The code handles the constraints \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \) appropriately.
  - The input vertices are sorted, which is necessary for the additional triangle count checks.

The provided code snippet correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake based on the given problem description and constraints. The additional functions listed are not directly used in the main logic of the problem, and the main logic itself is correct.
