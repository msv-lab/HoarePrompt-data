The function `func_21` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `mod`. `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns the remainder of `a` raised to the power of `b` divided by `mod`. After the function concludes, `a` is the remainder of `a` raised to the power of `2^k` divided by `mod` (where `k` is the number of times `b` was right-shifted), `b` is 0, and `mod` remains unchanged. The final state of the program is such that the function has computed and returned the result of `a` raised to the power of the initial `b` modulo `mod`.
