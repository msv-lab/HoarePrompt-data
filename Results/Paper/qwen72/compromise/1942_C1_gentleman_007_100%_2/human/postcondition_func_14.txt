The function `func_15` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns a list `f` containing `n + 1` elements. Each element in the list is the factorial of its index modulo `mod`. The `mod` operation is applied twice in the code, but effectively, it results in the same value as applying it once.
