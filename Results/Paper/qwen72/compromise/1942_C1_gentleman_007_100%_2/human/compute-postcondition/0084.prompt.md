You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are lists of integers or strings, and both are non-empty.
def func_22(a, b):
    dp = [([0] * (len(b) + 1)) for _ in range(len(a) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(a) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(b) + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` and `b` remain non-empty lists of integers or strings. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where each element is initialized to 0. For each `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. The value of `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is `len(b)`.
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` and `b` remain non-empty lists of integers or strings, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where each element is initialized to 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` that are also in `b` in the order they appear in `a`.
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the reverse of the string `s`, which is formed by joining the elements of `l` together, where `l` contains the elements of `a` that are also in `b` in the order they appear in `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two non-empty lists `a` and `b` of integers or strings, and returns the reverse of a string formed by joining the elements of `a` that are also in `b`, in the order they appear in `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the reverse of the string `s`, which is formed by joining the elements of `l` together, where `l` contains the elements of `a` that are also in `b` in the order they appear in `a`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
