Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` will have been processed completely. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` will be set to `True`, and these nodes will be appended to `q` in the order they were processed. `q` will contain at least one element, and `ver` will be the first element that was removed from `q` before the loop started.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, every node in the list `graph[ver]` will have been checked. If a node was unvisited (i.e., `vis[node]` was `False`) at the beginning, it will now be marked as visited (`vis[node]` will be `True`), and it will have been added to the queue `q` in the order it was processed. The queue `q` will still contain at least one element, and `ver` will be the first element that was removed from `q` before the loop started.
