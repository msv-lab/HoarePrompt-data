You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, and graph is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices. vis is a list of integers where vis[i] is 0 if vertex i has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `ver` will be the last vertex processed by the loop, and `q` will be an empty deque. The `vis` list will have been updated so that `vis[ver]` is `1` for every vertex `ver` that was processed, indicating that all reachable vertices from the initial `ver` have been visited. The `graph` dictionary or list of lists will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph and returns a list of adjacent vertices that have not been visited yet.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
