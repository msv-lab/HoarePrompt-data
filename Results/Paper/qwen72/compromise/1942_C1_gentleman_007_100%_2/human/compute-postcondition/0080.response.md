Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` and `b` remain non-empty lists of integers or strings, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where each element is initialized to 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` that are also in `b` in the order they appear in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` and `j`**: The loop continues to decrement `i` and `j` until both are 0. This means that by the time the loop finishes, `i` and `j` will both be 0.
- **`a` and `b`**: These lists remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`dp`**: This 2D list is populated based on the initial conditions provided. The loop itself does not modify `dp` directly, so its state remains as described in the initial conditions.
- **`l`**: The list `l` accumulates elements from `a` that are also in `b` and are part of the longest common subsequence. The loop appends these elements to `l` in reverse order, so the final `l` will contain these elements in the order they appear in `a`.
