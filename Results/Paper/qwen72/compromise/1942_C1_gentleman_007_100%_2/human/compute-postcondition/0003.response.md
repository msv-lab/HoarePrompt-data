The only object in the loop head is the deque `q`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `q`. If `len(q)` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `q` is a deque containing the integer `ver`, which means `len(q)` is 1. Since `len(q)` is 1, the loop will certainly execute at least once.

State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, `q` is a deque containing the integer `ver`**
