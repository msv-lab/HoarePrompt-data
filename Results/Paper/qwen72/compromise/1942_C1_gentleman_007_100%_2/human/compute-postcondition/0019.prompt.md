Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node. `node` is the first node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `False`), `q` now contains `node` at the end and `node` has been visited (`vis[node]` is `True`). Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and `q` does not contain `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, and `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least two nodes. `node` is the second node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `False`), `q` now contains `node` at the end and `vis[node]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and `q` does not contain `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, and `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least three nodes. `node` is the third node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `False`), `q` now contains `node` at the end and `vis[node]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and `q` does not contain `node`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
