#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. The new string `s` is formed by mapping each unique character in `b` to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter, where the characters are sorted in ascending order and mapped to letters starting from the end of the alphabet. The original string `b` and the `char_map` dictionary used for the mapping remain unchanged.
