Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. The function `func_1` creates a mapping from each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in reverse order of the alphabet, but it should map to the characters in the reverse order of the sorted set of `b` itself, not the entire alphabet.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

In this corrected version, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of the unique characters in `b`. The `char_map` dictionary is then constructed to map each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character in the same list. This ensures that the decoding process correctly reverses the encoding algorithm.
