Correctness: **False**

The program has a couple of issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Default Value for `defaultdict`**:
   - The `defaultdict` is initialized with `default_value`, which is not defined in the program. It should be initialized with a function that returns the default value, such as `lambda: 0`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Minimum Number of Problems**:
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of problems needed is incorrect. The program should check how many problems of each difficulty level are missing to meet the requirement of `m` rounds, and then sum these missing problems.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize defaultdict with int, which defaults to 0
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1  # Increment the count of each difficulty level
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]  # Calculate the number of missing problems for each difficulty level
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization of `defaultdict`**:
  - `defaultdict(int)` initializes a dictionary where the default value for any key is `0`.
- **Counting Problems**:
  - The loop `for i in range(n): d[s[i]] += 1` counts the number of problems of each difficulty level.
- **Calculating Missing Problems**:
  - The loop `for val in 'ABCDEFG':` iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
  - If the count of a difficulty level is less than `m`, it calculates the number of additional problems needed and adds it to `ans`.

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for the given problem description.
