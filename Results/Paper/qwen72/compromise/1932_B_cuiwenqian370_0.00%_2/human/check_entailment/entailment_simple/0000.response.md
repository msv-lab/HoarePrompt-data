Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a scenario where the Chaya tribe is waiting for n signs of the apocalypse, each occurring periodically. The goal is to find the year when the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program provided, however, does not correctly implement the logic to solve this problem. Instead, it seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to finding the longest sequence of valid signs in a list.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a list of strings (`path`) where each string is either `'@'` (indicating a valid sign) or `'*'` (indicating an invalid sign).
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of valid signs that can be found in a sequence, but this is not relevant to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs.
   - The function does not use the periodicities of the signs (`a_i`), which are crucial for solving the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It incorrectly assumes that the input for each test case is a single string (`path`), which is not the case. The input for each test case should be a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - The function calls `func_1` with a single string, which is not the correct input format for the problem.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_i`.
2. Calculate the year when the n-th sign will occur by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, starting from the first sign and incrementing the year based on the periodicity of the next sign.

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
import sys
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(n, a):
    year = a[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        year = lcm(year, a[i])
    return year

def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
        index += 1
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, a))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It is designed to solve a different problem and does not use the periodicities of the signs to determine the year when the n-th sign will occur.

Correctness: **False**
