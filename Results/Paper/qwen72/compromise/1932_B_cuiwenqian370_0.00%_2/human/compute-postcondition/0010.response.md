The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function uses or accesses a variable `t` and a list `data` within its execution. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `data` is a list of strings containing the input data for all test cases. The function returns the processed results based on the input data for the test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of strings `data` containing input data for `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and returns the results of processing these test cases.**
