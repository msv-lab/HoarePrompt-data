The `data` variable is updated to a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`. The initial state specifies that `data` is a list of strings containing the input data for all test cases, and now it contains the split input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.**
