### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided Python program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, m, nums)`
1. **Total Digits Calculation**:
   - `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`: This line correctly calculates the total number of digits in all the numbers in the list.
2. **Count of Trailing Zeros**:
   - `cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`: This line correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts these counts in descending order.
3. **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
   - `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`: This loop subtracts the number of trailing zeros for every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros. The idea is to simulate Anna's optimal moves, where she would reverse the digits of the numbers with the most trailing zeros first. However, this approach is not entirely correct. Anna's optimal move is to reverse the digits of the number with the most trailing zeros, but the subtraction of trailing zeros should be done for each number, not just every second one. This is because reversing a number with trailing zeros can significantly reduce the number of digits in the final concatenated number.
4. **Determine Winner**:
   - `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`: This line checks if the total number of digits after Anna's optimal moves is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). This is the correct condition to determine the winner.

#### Function 2: `zerocnts(num)`
1. **Convert to String**:
   - `num = str(num)`: This correctly converts the number to a string.
2. **Count Trailing Zeros**:
   - `tot = 0`: Initializes a counter for trailing zeros.
   - `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1): if num[i] != '0': break; tot += 1`: This loop correctly counts the number of trailing zeros by iterating from the end of the string until a non-zero digit is encountered.

### Correctness Verification
1. **Total Digits Calculation**:
   - The total number of digits in the list is correctly calculated.
2. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
   - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in each number.
3. **Optimal Moves**:
   - The original assessment suggests that Anna's optimal strategy is to reverse the digits of the numbers with the most trailing zeros first. However, the implementation in `func_1` only subtracts every second trailing zero count, which is incorrect. Anna should reverse the digits of the number with the most trailing zeros, and this should be done for each number, not just every second one.
4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The final condition to determine the winner is correct.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is partially correct in its logic but incorrect in its implementation. The loop that subtracts trailing zeros should subtract the trailing zeros for each number, not just every second one. This is because each number with trailing zeros can be reversed independently, and the total number of digits should be adjusted accordingly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate Anna's optimal moves by subtracting trailing zeros for each number. This oversight can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.
