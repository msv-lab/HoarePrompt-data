### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when there is only one integer left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final integer is not less than \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - It calculates the total number of digits in the list `nums`.
     - It then counts the number of trailing zeros in each integer using the `zerocnts` function.
     - The counts of trailing zeros are sorted in descending order.
     - It subtracts the counts of trailing zeros at even indices from the total number of digits.
     - Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the resulting value is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\); otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
   - **`zerocnts`**:
     - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer.
     - It iterates from the end of the string representation of the number and counts zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The total number of digits in the list `nums` is calculated correctly using `sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.
   - The `zerocnts` function correctly counts the trailing zeros in each number.
   - The counts of trailing zeros are sorted in descending order, which is a reasonable step to ensure that the largest counts are considered first.
   - The subtraction of trailing zeros at even indices from the total number of digits is intended to simulate the effect of Anna's moves on the total digit count.
   - The final check `if tot >= m + 1` is used to determine if Sasha can win by making the final number have at least \(m + 1\) digits.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - Anna's optimal strategy is to reverse numbers to minimize the number of digits that can be concatenated by Sasha.
   - Sasha's optimal strategy is to concatenate numbers to maximize the number of digits in the final number.
   - The logic in `func_1` attempts to simulate this by reducing the total digit count based on Anna's moves and then checking if the remaining digit count is sufficient for Sasha to win.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the list has only one number.
   - The function correctly processes the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions and the logic they implement seem to correctly follow the problem description and the rules of the game. The approach of counting trailing zeros and subtracting them from the total digit count is a reasonable heuristic to determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
