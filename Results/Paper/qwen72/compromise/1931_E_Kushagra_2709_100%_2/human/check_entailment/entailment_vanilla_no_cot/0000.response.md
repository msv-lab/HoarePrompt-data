Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not fully capture the optimal play strategy for both Sasha and Anna. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the total number of digits in the list and then subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the largest elements in pairs, but this approach does not correctly model the game's rules or the optimal strategy for winning.

### Issues:
1. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
   - The function `zerocnts` calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the optimal play. The game involves reversing digits and concatenating numbers, which can change the number of digits significantly.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - The game's optimal strategy is more complex than just subtracting trailing zeros. Anna can reverse any number, and Sasha can concatenate any two numbers. The goal is to determine if Sasha can create a number with at least \(10^m\) digits after Anna's moves. This requires a more nuanced approach to consider the possible outcomes of each move.

3. **Concatenation and Reversal**:
   - The solution does not account for the fact that reversing a number can change its length, and concatenating two numbers can create a number with a different length. The total number of digits in the list is not sufficient to determine the winner without considering these operations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:
- **Anna's Move**: Reversing a number can change its length, but it does not affect the total number of digits in the list.
- **Sasha's Move**: Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, which reduces the number of elements in the list by one but increases the total number of digits.
- **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits. This means that the total number of digits in the list after all moves must be at least \(m + 1\).

The correct solution should:
- Calculate the total number of digits in the list.
- Determine if Sasha can create a number with at least \(10^m\) digits by concatenating the remaining numbers after Anna's optimal moves.

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    # Calculate the total number of digits in the list
    total_digits = sum(len(str(num)) for num in nums)
    
    # Anna's optimal move is to reverse the smallest number, which does not change the total number of digits
    # Sasha's optimal move is to concatenate the two largest numbers, which reduces the number of elements by 1
    # The game ends when there is only one number left in the list
    
    # If the total number of digits is already greater than or equal to m + 1, Sasha wins
    if total_digits >= m + 1:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Anna'

# Function to count trailing zeros (not needed in the correct solution)
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot

# Example test cases
test_cases = [
    (2, 2, [14, 2]),
    (3, 5, [9, 56, 1]),
    (4, 10, [1, 2007, 800, 1580]),
    (4, 5, [5000, 123, 30, 4]),
    (10, 10, [6, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 10, 9, 10, 7]),
    (1, 1, [6]),
    (1, 1, [10]),
    (8, 9, [1, 2, 9, 10, 10, 2, 10, 2]),
    (4, 5, [10, 10, 10, 10])
]

# Run the test cases
for n, m, nums in test_cases:
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))
```

This solution correctly determines the winner based on the total number of digits in the list, which is the key factor in the game's outcome.
