Reasoning:
The program `func_1` is designed to solve the problem efficiently by precomputing the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `2 * 10^5` and storing these values in a list `values`. This precomputation allows the program to handle each test case in constant time by simply looking up the precomputed value.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `inf` is set to `2 * 10^5 + 1` to ensure the list `values` has enough space to store the sums up to `2 * 10^5`.
   - `values` is initialized as a list of zeros with length `inf`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to `inf - 1` (i.e., 1 to `2 * 10^5`).
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting `i` to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.
   - It then updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i - 1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`. This way, `values[i]` stores the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits from 1 to `i`.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the sums of the digits from 1 to `n`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(2 * 10^5) time, which is feasible given the constraints.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by a simple list lookup, making the program efficient even for the maximum number of test cases (10^4).

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly computes the sum of the sums of the digits for each integer from 1 to `n` and stores these values in the `values` list.
   - The output for each test case is the correct sum as required by the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
