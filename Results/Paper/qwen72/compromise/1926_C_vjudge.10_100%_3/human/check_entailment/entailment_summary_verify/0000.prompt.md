You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. It then prints the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it has printed the required sums for each test case. The final state of the program includes the variable `t` being the number of test cases, `inf` being 200001, and `values` being a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive for all `i` from 1 to `inf - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program initializes `t` to the number of test cases.
   - It creates an array `values` of size `2 * 10^5 + 1` to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each number up to `2 * 10^5`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `2 * 10^5` and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` array.
   - For each number `i`, it converts `i` to a string, iterates over each character, converts it back to an integer, and sums these integers to get `sum_value_digits`.
   - It then updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i-1]` and `sum_value_digits`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each test case, it reads the input `value` and prints `values[value]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `value`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - It also handles the upper limit `n = 2 * 10^5` correctly.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(2 * 10^5 * log(2 * 10^5)) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - Each query runs in O(1) time, which is within the 0.5 seconds time limit per test case.

Since the program meets all the requirements and handles all potential cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
