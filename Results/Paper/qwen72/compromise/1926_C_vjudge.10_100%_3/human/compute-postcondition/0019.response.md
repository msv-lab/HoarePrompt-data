The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the string `str(i)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t + 1`, and `x` is the second character of `str(i)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next character in the string `str(i)`.

If `i` is `t + 1`, and `x` is the second character, then for the next iteration, `x` will be the third character of `str(i)` (if it exists).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[i]` now equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `i` is `t + 1`, `x` is the third character of `str(i)`**
