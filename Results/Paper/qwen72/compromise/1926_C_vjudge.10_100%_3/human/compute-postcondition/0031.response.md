Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is now equal to `values[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of `i` for all `i` from `t + 1` to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `n`, `x` is the last digit of `n`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial input integer `t` remains unchanged.
- The integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `inf` remains 200001.
- The list `values` is now populated such that each element from index `t + 1` to `n` is the sum of the previous element and the sum of the digits of the current index.
- The variable `i` is now `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations up to `n`.
- The variable `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `n`.
- The variable `x` is the last digit of `n`.
