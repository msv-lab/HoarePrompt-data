The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` updates the value of `sum_value_digits` by adding the integer value of the first character of the string representation of `i` to it. Given the initial state, let's break down the impact:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case.
- `inf` is 200001.
- `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, with `values[i]` now equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.
- `i` is `t + 1`.
- `x` is the first character of `str(i)`.
- `sum_value_digits` is 0.

The code snippet updates `sum_value_digits` by adding the integer value of `x` to it. Since `x` is the first character of `str(i)`, and `i` is `t + 1`, the value of `x` is the first digit of the string representation of `t + 1`.

Let's calculate the specific value of `x`:
- If `t` is 1, then `i` is 2, and `x` is '2'.
- If `t` is 2, then `i` is 3, and `x` is '3'.
- If `t` is 3, then `i` is 4, and `x` is '4'.
- And so on...

Therefore, `sum_value_digits` becomes `int(x)`, which is the integer value of the first digit of `t + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[i]` now equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `i` is `t + 1`, `x` is the first character of `str(i)`, `sum_value_digits` is the integer value of the first digit of `str(t + 1)`**.
