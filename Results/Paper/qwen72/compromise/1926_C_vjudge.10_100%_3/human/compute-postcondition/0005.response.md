The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the string representation of `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be a positive integer, as its string representation will contain at least one character, which will allow the loop to iterate over each character.

Given that `i` is already 1, which is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `x` will take on the value of each character in the string representation of `i` during each iteration of the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` will be the first character of the string representation of `i`**
