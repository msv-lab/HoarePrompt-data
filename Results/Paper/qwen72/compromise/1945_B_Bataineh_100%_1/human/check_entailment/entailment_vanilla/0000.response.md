### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the launch frequencies of the two installations and the visibility duration of the fireworks, respectively.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` conditions to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - **Case 1:** `if m < a and m < b:`
     - If the visibility duration `m` is less than both launch frequencies `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2. This is because each installation can only launch one firework within the visibility duration of `m + 1` minutes.
   - **Case 2:** `elif m < a and m > b:`
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // b`. This is because the first installation can only launch one firework within `m + 1` minutes, but the second installation can launch multiple fireworks within `m + 1` minutes.
   - **Case 3:** `elif m < b and m > a:`
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // a`. This is because the second installation can only launch one firework within `m + 1` minutes, but the first installation can launch multiple fireworks within `m + 1` minutes.
   - **Case 4:** `else:`
     - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is because both installations can launch multiple fireworks within `m + 1` minutes.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the program is designed to handle different scenarios based on the relationship between `m`, `a`, and `b`.
- The conditions are correctly structured to cover all possible cases:
  - When `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, only one firework from each installation can be visible at the same time.
  - When `m` is greater than one of the frequencies but less than the other, the installation with the higher frequency can launch multiple fireworks within the visibility duration.
  - When `m` is greater than or equal to both frequencies, both installations can launch multiple fireworks within the visibility duration.

### Verification:
- **Case 1:** `6 7 4`
  - `m < a` and `m < b` are both true, so the output is `2`.
- **Case 2:** `3 4 10`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true, so the output is `10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7`.
- **Case 3:** `7 8 56`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true, so the output is `56 // 7 + 56 // 8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17`.
- **Case 4:** `5 6 78123459896`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true, so the output is `78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630`.
- **Case 5:** `1 1 1`
  - `m < a` and `m < b` are both false, so the output is `1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.
- **Case 6:** `1 1 1000000000000000000`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true, so the output is `1000000000000000000 // 1 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002`.
