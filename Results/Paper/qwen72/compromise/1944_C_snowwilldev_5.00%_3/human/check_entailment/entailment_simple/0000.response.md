### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. This is a correct approach to keep track of how many times each element appears.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program iterates through the range `[0, N-1]` and checks the count of each element `i` in the array `a`.
   - If an element `i` appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), Alice can choose it to maximize the MEX, and Bob will avoid it to minimize the MEX.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of elements that appear exactly once.
   - The program prints the current index `i` and breaks the loop if either:
     - `t` is greater than or equal to 2 (meaning there are at least two unique elements that appear exactly once, which Alice can use to her advantage).
     - `cnt[i] == 0` (meaning the current index `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, which is the MEX).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all elements are unique or all elements are the same.

5. **Optimality:**
   - The program's logic is based on the idea that Alice will always choose elements that appear exactly once to maximize the MEX, and Bob will avoid these elements to minimize the MEX.
   - This strategy is optimal because it ensures that the smallest possible MEX is achieved by the time the game ends.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
