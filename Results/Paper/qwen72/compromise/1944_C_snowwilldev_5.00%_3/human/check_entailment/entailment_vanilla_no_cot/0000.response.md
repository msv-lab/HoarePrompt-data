Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and the optimal strategy for both players. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Elements**: It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - The key insight is that Alice and Bob will play optimally by focusing on the smallest integers first. Alice will try to include the smallest integers that appear only once in `a` to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to remove the smallest integers that appear only once to minimize the MEX.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks the count of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears only once, Alice will include it in `c` and Bob will remove it, incrementing a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 (meaning two integers that appear only once have been processed) or if an integer `i` does not appear in `a`, the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
