Output State: **`tc` is `t-1`, `N` is the last input integer greater than 0, `i` is the index at which the loop broke or `N-1` if the loop completed all iterations, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and contains the count of each integer in the last list `a`, `t` is the number of unique elements in the last list `a` that appear exactly once up to the point where the loop breaks, and `a` is the last list of integers input by the user.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`tc`**: This variable will be `t-1` because the loop runs `t` times, and `tc` is incremented at the start of each iteration.
- **`N`**: This will be the last input integer `N` provided for the final test case.
- **`i`**: This will be the index at which the loop broke due to either `t` reaching 2 or `cnt[i]` being 0. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `N-1`.
- **`cnt`**: This will be a defaultdict containing the count of each integer in the last list `a` that was input by the user.
- **`t`**: This will be the number of unique elements in the last list `a` that appear exactly once, up to the point where the loop breaks. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `t` will be the total number of unique elements that appear exactly once in `a`.
- **`a`**: This will be the last list of integers input by the user for the final test case.
