Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and contains the count of each integer in the list `a` up to index `N-1`, `t` is the number of times an integer at index `i` in the list `a` has a count of 1, up to the point where the loop breaks. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2, or the count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 0, the loop breaks and prints `i`. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations and `t` will be the total number of times an integer at index `i` in the list `a` has a count of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once up to the point where the loop breaks, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `N-1` and `t` will be the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once. If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0 at any iteration, the loop breaks and `i` will be the index at which the loop broke.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is the value of `N-1`, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each element in `a`, `t` is the number of times an element with a count of 1 was encountered in `a`, and `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. The loop will break if `t` reaches 2 or if an element in `a` has a count of 0, and the value of `i` at which this happens will be printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
