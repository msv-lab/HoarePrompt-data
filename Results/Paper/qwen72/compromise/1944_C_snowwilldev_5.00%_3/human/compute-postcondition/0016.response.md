Postcondition: **`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `tc` is 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and contains the count of each integer in the list `a` up to index `N-1`. The count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 1, and `t` is 1. However, the current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2, or the count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 0.**
