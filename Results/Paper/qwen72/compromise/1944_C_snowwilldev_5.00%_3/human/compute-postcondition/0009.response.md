Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tc` is 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt[a[0]]` is 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[2]]` by 1.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[2]` is the third element in the list `a`.
- The initial value of `cnt[a[2]]` is not specified, so it is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
