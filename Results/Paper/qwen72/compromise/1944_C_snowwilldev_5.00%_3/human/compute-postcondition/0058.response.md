Postcondition: ***`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `tc` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues normally.***
