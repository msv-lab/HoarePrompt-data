Output State: **`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains `{a[0]: 2, a[2]: 1}`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once up to the point where the loop breaks, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `2` in the list `a` by 1 in the `cnt` defaultdict. Since `i` is 2, the element `a[2]` is accessed and its count in `cnt` is increased by 1. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
