Output State: **`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `tc` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.**

The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
