The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `p` (a list of distinct integers), `s` (a list of two integers representing starting positions), and `k` (a positive integer representing the number of turns). It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` observed during the loop execution, where `cur` is the cumulative sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop, `k` is the remaining number of turns (which could be 0), and `a[s]` is the element of the list `a` at the position `s` where the loop terminates. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `p`, but it updates the position `s` and the number of turns `k` as it progresses through the loop. The list `vis` is used to track visited positions, and its elements are set to 1 for the positions visited during the loop.
