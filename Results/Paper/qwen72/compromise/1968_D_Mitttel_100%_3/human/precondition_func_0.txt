a and p are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where each element of p is a distinct integer from 1 to n, and each element of a is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). s is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n. k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game.
