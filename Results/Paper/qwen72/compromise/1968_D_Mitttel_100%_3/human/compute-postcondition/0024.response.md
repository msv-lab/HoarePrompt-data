The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`. 

- `a` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9.
- `p` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of `a` and `p`.
- `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, where each position is between 1 and n.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns in the game, with a value between 1 and 10^9.

The function returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` observed during the loop execution, where:
- `cur` is the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop.
- `k` is the remaining number of turns, which could be 0.
- `a[s]` is the element of the list `a` at the position `s` where the loop terminates.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers, a list `p` of distinct integers, a list `s` of two starting positions, and a positive integer `k` representing the number of turns. It returns the maximum value of the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop plus the product of the remaining number of turns and the element of `a` at the final position.**
