To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`.

1. **`not vis[s]`**: This condition checks if the element at index `s` in the `vis` list is not marked as visited (i.e., `vis[s]` is `0` or `False`). If `vis[s]` is `True` (or `1`), the loop will not execute again.

2. **`k > 0`**: This condition checks if `k` is greater than 0. If `k` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` and `p` remain unchanged.
- `s` is updated to `p[s]`.
- `k` is decreased by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `mx` is updated to `max(0, cur + k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, cur + k * a[P_S])`.
- `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S]`.
- `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`k`**: Since `k` is decreased by 1, it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 0.
2. **`vis[s]`**: The variable `s` is updated to `p[s]` in each iteration. For the loop to execute again, `vis[s]` must be `0` or `False` after the update. If `vis[s]` is `1` (or `True`), the loop will not execute again.

### Adjustments:
- **`k`**: Ensure that `k` is greater than 0.
- **`vis[s]`**: Ensure that `vis[s]` is `0` or `False` after the update `s = p[s]`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0, and `vis[s]` must be `0` or `False` after the update `s = p[s]`.

State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(0, cur + k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, cur + k * a[P_S])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S]`, `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1, and `vis[s]` must be `0` or `False`**.
