The variables in the loop head are `vis[s]` and `k`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust these variables accordingly.

1. **`vis[s]`**: The loop condition checks if `vis[s]` is `False`. If `vis[s]` is `False`, the loop can proceed. At the end of the last iteration, `vis[s]` was set to `True` (since `vis[s]` is updated to 1). Therefore, `vis[s]` needs to be reset to `False` for the loop to execute again.

2. **`k`**: The loop condition also checks if `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` was greater than 0 and decreased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, `k` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `vis[s]` must be `False`.
- `k` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(mx, cur + (k-1) * a[s])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s]`, `vis[s]` must be `False`**
