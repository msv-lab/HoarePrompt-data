Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Adjustment of Arrays `a` and `p`:**
   - The program adjusts the elements of arrays `a` and `p` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is incorrect because the elements of `p` should remain as they are (they are indices of the permutation), and the elements of `a` should not be adjusted at all.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Score:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` over `k` turns. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the permutation. It only updates the maximum score `mx` based on the current position and the number of remaining turns, which can lead to incorrect results if the player is in a cycle.

3. **Cycle Detection and Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` should detect cycles in the permutation and calculate the score accordingly. If a player is in a cycle, the score should be calculated by considering the total score gained within the cycle and the number of times the cycle can be repeated within the remaining turns.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the function `func_1` should:
1. Detect if the player is in a cycle.
2. Calculate the total score gained within the cycle.
3. Determine the number of complete cycles that can be repeated within the remaining turns.
4. Calculate the score for the remaining turns after the complete cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    score = 0
    cycle_start = -1
    cycle_score = 0
    cycle_length = 0
    
    while k > 0:
        if vis[s] == 0:
            vis[s] = 1
            score += a[s]
            if cycle_start == -1:
                cycle_start = s
            cycle_score += a[s]
            cycle_length += 1
            s = p[s]
            k -= 1
        else:
            break
    
    if cycle_start != -1 and cycle_length > 0:
        full_cycles = k // cycle_length
        remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remaining_turns):
            score += a[s]
            s = p[s]
    
    return score

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation indices to 0-based
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program now correctly detects if the player is in a cycle and calculates the score for the complete cycles and the remaining turns.
2. **Correct Array Adjustment:**
   - Only the permutation array `p` is adjusted to 0-based indexing, not the array `a`.

This corrected approach should handle all the test cases correctly.
