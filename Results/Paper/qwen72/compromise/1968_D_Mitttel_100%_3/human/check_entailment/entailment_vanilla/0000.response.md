### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing. This is necessary because Python lists are 0-based.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` of length `n` with all elements set to 0 to keep track of visited positions.
   - The while loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and `k` is greater than 0.
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining `k` turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves the player to the next position `p[s]`.
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx`.

4. **Comparing Scores:**
   - The program calls `func_1` twice, once for Bodya and once for Sasha, to get their respective maximum scores.
   - It then compares the scores and prints the result:
     - "Draw" if both scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the maximum score in `func_1` is based on the idea that a player can either stay at the current position or move to the next position in the permutation. The function correctly tracks the score and the number of turns remaining.
- The use of the `vis` list ensures that the function does not get stuck in an infinite loop if the permutation contains cycles.
- The maximum score is updated by considering the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns, which is a valid strategy since the player can always choose to stay.

### Potential Issues:
- **Index Adjustment:**
  - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1. However, it also subtracts 1 from the elements of `a`, which is incorrect. The elements of `a` should remain as they are, only the indices should be adjusted.
  - Corrected code should be:
    ```python
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
    ```

- **Cycle Handling:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly handles cycles by using the `vis` list, but it does not explicitly handle the case where the player is stuck in a cycle and has to make the best decision within the cycle.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the corrected program is used.
- **False** if the original program is used due to the incorrect adjustment of the `a` array.

Given the original program, the correctness is **False**. However, with the corrected program, the correctness is **True**.
