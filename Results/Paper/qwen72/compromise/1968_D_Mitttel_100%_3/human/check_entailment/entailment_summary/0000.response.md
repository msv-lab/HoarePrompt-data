Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case. It also adjusts the indices of the starting positions and the permutation and array elements to be 0-based, which is a good practice in Python.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player from a given starting position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current cumulative score.
   - It initializes `vis` to a list of zeros, which will track the visited positions to avoid infinite loops in the permutation.
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it marks the current position as visited, updates the maximum score `mx` to be the maximum of the current maximum score and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns (`cur + k * a[s]`).
   - It then adds the score at the current position to `cur` and moves to the next position `p[s]`, decrementing `k` by 1.
   - The loop terminates when either the current position is revisited or the number of turns `k` is exhausted.
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx` that the player can achieve.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The main loop of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha with their respective starting positions and the number of turns `k`.
   - It then compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where the permutation contains cycles, which it does by using the `vis` list to track visited positions.
   - The program should handle the case where the number of turns `k` is very large, which it does by decrementing `k` and updating the score in each iteration.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints "Draw" if both players have the same score, "Bodya" if Bodya has a higher score, and "Sasha" if Sasha has a higher score.

6. **Performance**:
   - The program should be efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it only iterates through the permutation and array elements up to `k` times, and the use of the `vis` list ensures that it does not get stuck in infinite loops.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
