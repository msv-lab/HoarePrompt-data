### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustments:**
   - The program correctly parses the input and adjusts the starting positions `pb` and `ps` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-indexed positions.
   - The permutation `p` and the array `a` are also adjusted by subtracting 1, which is incorrect because the elements of `p` and `a` should remain as they are. The elements of `p` should be in the range [1, n] and the elements of `a` should be in the range [1, 10^9].

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - The function maintains a list `vis` to track visited positions, which is a good approach to avoid infinite loops in case of cycles in the permutation.
   - The loop correctly updates the current score `cur` and the remaining turns `k` while moving to the next position `p[s]`.
   - The variable `mx` is used to track the maximum score that could be achieved by the player, which is a good approach to handle the case where the player might stay in a cycle and maximize their score.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - After computing the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`, the program correctly compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The adjustment of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 is incorrect and should be removed. The elements of `p` should remain in the range [1, n] and the elements of `a` should remain in the range [1, 10^9].
   - The function `func_1` should not modify the elements of `a` and `p` by subtracting 1. Instead, it should use the original values.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the adjustment of `p` and `a`, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False****

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, remove the adjustments to `p` and `a` by subtracting 1. The correct version of the program should look like this:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s] - 1  # Adjust p[s] to 0-indexed
    return mx
```

This version correctly handles the input and ensures that the elements of `p` and `a` remain in their original ranges.
