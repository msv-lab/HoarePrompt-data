Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not solve the problem as described. The functions defined in the program do not align with the requirements of the problem, which involves determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be cut from a regular polygon with given vertices. The functions in the program seem to be related to various algorithms and operations such as prime factorization, greatest common divisor, prefix sums, and graph traversal, but none of these functions are used in a way that would solve the specific problem of maximizing the number of triangular pieces from a polygon with selected vertices.

To solve the problem, you would need to focus on the geometry of the polygon and the combinatorial aspects of choosing vertices to form non-intersecting triangles. The program should take the number of sides of the polygon, the vertices already chosen by Bessie, and then determine how to maximize the number of triangles by potentially adding more vertices (though in this version, `y = 0`, so no additional vertices can be chosen).

The correct approach would involve:
1. Reading the input and parsing the test cases.
2. For each test case, identifying the vertices that can form non-intersecting triangles.
3. Calculating the maximum number of such triangles that can be formed with the given vertices.
4. Outputting the result for each test case.

The provided program does not perform these steps, and the functions it defines are not relevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
