The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `ver`, using an external adjacency list `graph` and a visited list `vis`. After the function concludes, all vertices reachable from `ver` that were not previously visited are marked as visited in `vis`, and their order of processing is printed to the console. The `stack` used for the DFS is empty, and the `vis` list reflects the updated visited status of all nodes.
