The function `func_22` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-empty lists of integers. The function returns a string that is the reverse of `s`, where `s` is formed by concatenating the elements of list `l` (which contains the elements of `a` that contribute to the common subsequence between `a` and `b` as determined by the `dp` table) converted to strings.
