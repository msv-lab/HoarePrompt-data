The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` still contains elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must still contain at least one element, and `node` will now be the second element in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `node` has been visited (`vis[node]` is `True`) and `node` is appended to `q`. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and is not appended to `q`.**
