Output State: **`q` has the same number of elements as before the operation, `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `node` is the first node in `graph[ver]`, and `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `False`).**

The code `q.append(node)` adds the `node` to the end of the list `q`, so the number of elements in `q` is now the same as it was before the operation that removed an element. All other conditions remain unchanged.
