Output State: **`ver` is now the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed and `node` appended to the right end, `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable, `vis[ver]` is 1, and `vis[node]` is 1.**

The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, updating the state of the `vis` dictionary. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
