Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and `q` is a deque with all the nodes that were reachable from the initial `ver` and not previously visited, appended to it. Each of these nodes has been marked as visited in the `vis` list (i.e., `vis[node]` is set to 1). The `ver` variable holds the value of the last node processed from the deque `q`.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the deque `q` contains all the nodes that were reachable from the initial `ver` and were not already visited. Each of these nodes has been marked as visited in the `vis` list. The `ver` variable now holds the value of the last node that was processed from the deque `q`.
