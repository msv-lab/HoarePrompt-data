Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` that contribute to the common subsequence between `a` and `b` as determined by the `dp` table.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `i` and `j` will both be 0, indicating that the loop has traversed all the elements of the lists `a` and `b`. The list `l` will contain the elements from `a` that form a common subsequence with `b`, as determined by the values in the `dp` table. The `dp` table itself remains unchanged, with its last row and last column still holding their initial non-zero values.
