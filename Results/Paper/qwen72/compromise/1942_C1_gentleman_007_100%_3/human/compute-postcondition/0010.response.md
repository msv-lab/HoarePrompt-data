Postcondition: ***`ver` is now the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is appended to the right end of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable, and `vis[ver]` is 1.***
