Functionality: ** The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `num` where `num >= 2` and returns a list containing all prime numbers from 2 to `num` (inclusive). The function also updates two lists, `Highest_Prime` and `Lowest_Prime`, where `Highest_Prime[i]` is the highest prime factor of `i` and `Lowest_Prime[i]` is the lowest prime factor of `i` for all `i` from 2 to `num`. However, these lists are not returned and are only used internally within the function. After the function concludes, the input parameter `num` remains unchanged. **
