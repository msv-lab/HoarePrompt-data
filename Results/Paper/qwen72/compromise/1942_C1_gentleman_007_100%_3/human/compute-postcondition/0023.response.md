The only objects in the loop head are `node`, `graph`, and `ver`. The loop will execute if `graph[ver]` is a non-empty list. Since the state before the loop starts mentions that `q` has one less element than before and `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q`, we need to ensure that `graph[ver]` contains at least one node for the loop to execute. The state of `vis` is not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

State: **`q` has one less element than before, `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `node` is the first node in `graph[ver]`**
