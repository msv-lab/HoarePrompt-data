Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is now the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is now the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is appended to the right end of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable, and `vis[ver]` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed. `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `vis[ver]` is 1, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is appended to the right of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed. `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `vis[ver]` is 1, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is appended to the right of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
