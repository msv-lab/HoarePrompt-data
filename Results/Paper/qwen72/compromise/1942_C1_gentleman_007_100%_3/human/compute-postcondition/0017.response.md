Output State: **`ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed and `node` appended to the right, `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `vis[ver]` is 1, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is 1.**

The code sets `vis[node]` to 1, marking `node` as visited. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
