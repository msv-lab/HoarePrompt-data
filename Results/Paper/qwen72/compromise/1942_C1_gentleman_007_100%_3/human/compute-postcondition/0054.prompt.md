Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each entry represents the adjacency list of a vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, and `q` is a deque containing the value `ver`.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has finished executing, and `q` is a deque with all the nodes that were reachable from the initial `ver` and not previously visited, appended to it. Each of these nodes has been marked as visited in the `vis` list (i.e., `vis[node]` is set to 1). The `ver` variable holds the value of the last node processed from the deque `q`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` has no elements left, `ver` is the last element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, and all nodes that were in `q` initially and their neighbors (that were not already visited) are now marked as visited in the `vis` list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` has been fully processed. For each element `node` in `graph[ver]`, if `vis[node]` was initially `False`, it is now `True`, and `node` has been appended to `q`. If `vis[node]` was initially `True`, `node` remains unvisited and is not appended to `q`. The list `q` now contains all the unvisited neighbors of `ver` that were processed during the loop, in the order they were appended.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
