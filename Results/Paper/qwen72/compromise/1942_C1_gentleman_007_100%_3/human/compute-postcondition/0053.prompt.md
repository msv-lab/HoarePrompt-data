Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` has one fewer element at the front, `ver` is now the element that was second in `q` before the operation, all nodes that were in `q` initially and their neighbors (that were not already visited) are now marked as visited in the `vis` list.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `node` has been visited (`vis[node]` is `True`) and `node` is appended to `q`. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and is not appended to `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `node` has been visited (`vis[node]` is `True`) and `node` is appended to `q`, so `q` now contains `node` at the end of its list. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and is not appended to `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least 3 elements, and `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `vis[node]` is updated to `True`, `node` has been visited, and `node` is appended to `q`, so `q` now contains `node` at the end of its list. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains `False`, `node` remains unvisited, and `node` is not appended to `q`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
