Postcondition: **`n = 0`, `h = (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1) + (n - k + 1) // 1`, `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`, and `h < k`.**

In natural language: `n` is 0, `h` is calculated as `(n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1) + (n - k + 1) // 1`, `costs` is a list containing the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`, and the current value of `h` is less than `k`.
