To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`.

1. **`costs`**: This is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. For the loop to execute, `costs` must be a non-empty list. Given the initial state, `costs` is already non-empty because it contains two elements.

2. **`i`**: This variable will take on the values of the elements in `costs` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first element of `costs`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k.
- Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k.
- `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.

The loop will execute if `costs` is non-empty, which it is. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to the first element of `costs`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k, n is greater than or equal to k, `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0, `i` is `n - k + 1`**
