You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable, as the function definition does not specify any parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each coordinate x_i and y_i is an integer such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: The loop will print the smaller of the two squared distances between the diagonally opposite corners of the square for each test case. After all iterations, the variables `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, but these values are not retained or meaningful outside the loop. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of the square for each test case.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
