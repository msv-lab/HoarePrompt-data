You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first m elements of list `a`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the first m elements of list `a` and list `b`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same. `a` and `b` remain the same. `cb` remains the same. `ca` contains the frequency of each element in the sorted last `m` elements of list `a`. `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the last `m` elements of list `a` and list `b`. `ans` is the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
