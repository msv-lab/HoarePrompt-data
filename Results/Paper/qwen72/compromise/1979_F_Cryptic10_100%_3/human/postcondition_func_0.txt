The function operates in an interactive environment and does not accept any explicit parameters. It handles multiple test cases, each defined by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a complete undirected graph from which (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function can make at most n queries to the interactor to determine the structure of the graph. For each test case, the function outputs a Hamiltonian path, which is a sequence of vertices that visits each vertex exactly once. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and a Hamiltonian path has been output for each test case.
