Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers removed from `vx` during the loop execution. Each tuple in `ops` represents a pair `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` depending on the value of `v2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`int(input())` must be greater than 2:** This is a necessary condition for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`_` is a throwaway variable:** This variable is not used in the final output state and can be ignored.
- **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers:** The loop continues to remove elements from `vx` until `len(vx)` is 2 or less. Since the loop condition is `len(vx) > 2`, the loop will stop when `len(vx)` is exactly 2.
- **`ops` is a list containing tuples of integers removed from `vx` during the loop execution:** Each iteration of the loop either adds a single tuple `(v1, v2)` to `ops` if `v2` is greater than 0, or adds two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to `ops` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. The final `ops` list will contain all the tuples generated during the loop execution.
