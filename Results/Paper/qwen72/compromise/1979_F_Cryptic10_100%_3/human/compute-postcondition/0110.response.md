Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1` and the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. `p2` is an empty list if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain at least two tuples. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements. `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` appends `v1` to `p2` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, otherwise it appends `v1` to `p1`.
- If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`, and `p2` remains an empty list.
- If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p2`, and `p1` remains unchanged.
- The values of `ops`, `v1`, `v2`, `vx`, and `v3` are not affected by this code snippet.
