To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `len(vx) > 2`.

### Initial State:
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`
- `ops` is an empty list
- `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`
- `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(vx) > 2`.
2. **Current State of `vx`**: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`.
3. **Adjustment Needed**: For the loop to execute, `vx` must contain more than 2 elements. Since `vx` contains integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `vx`. The condition `len(vx) > 2` will be satisfied if `int(input())` is greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`**
