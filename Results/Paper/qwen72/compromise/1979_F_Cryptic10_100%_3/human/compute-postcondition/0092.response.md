Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(v1, v2)`. `vx` has one element removed, which was `v1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`.
- `v1` and `v2` retain their values as assigned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
- `p1` and `p2` are not affected and remain unchanged.
- `vx` has one element removed, which was `v1`, so the length of `vx` is reduced by 1.
