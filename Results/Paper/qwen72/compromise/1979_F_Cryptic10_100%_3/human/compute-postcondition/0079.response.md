The only variable in the loop head is `vx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `vx`. If the length of `vx` is greater than 2, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), and `ops` is an empty list. For the loop to execute the first time, the length of `vx` must be greater than 2. This means the input integer must be greater than 2.

State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `ops` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) and the input integer must be greater than 2.**
