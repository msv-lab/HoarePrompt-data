Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` and `int(input())` respectively, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus the new `v1` (and minus `v3` if the new `v2` is less than or equal to 0), `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if the new `v2` > 0, or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if the new `v2` <= 0, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all new `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to the new `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all new `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to the new `v2`, `vx` no longer contains the new `v1` and must have more than 2 elements.**

Explanation:
- The code `vx.remove(v1)` removes the value of `v1` from the set `vx`.
- The initial state specifies that `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus the new `v1` (and minus `v3` if the new `v2` is less than or equal to 0). After removing `v1`, `vx` will no longer contain `v1`.
- The condition that `vx` must have more than 2 elements remains valid.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
