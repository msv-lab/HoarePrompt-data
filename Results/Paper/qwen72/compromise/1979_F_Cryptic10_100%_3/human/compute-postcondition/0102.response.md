Output State: **`v3` is assigned the value returned by `q(0)`, and the second value returned by `q(0)` is ignored. `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `v2` > 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `vx` has two elements removed, the first being `v3` and the second being `v1`. If `v2` is 0 or less, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `vx` has two elements removed, the first being `v3` and the second being `v1`, and `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`. `vx` must have at least 2 elements if `v2` > 0, or at least 2 elements if `v2` is 0 or less, to ensure `len(vx) > 2` for the next iteration.**
