Let's break down the task step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 2. Let's denote this value as `n`.
2. `_` is a throwaway variable, which means it is not used in the final output.
3. `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `n`.
4. `ops` must contain at least as many tuples as the number of iterations.
5. `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`.
6. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Set `vx`**:
   - `n` is an integer greater than 2.
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the range 1 to `n`. Let's denote these integers as `a` and `b`. For example, if `n = 5`, `vx` could be `{2, 4}`.

2. **List `p1`**:
   - `p1` starts with the 2 integers from `vx`. So, if `vx = {2, 4}`, `p1` starts as `[2, 4]` or `[4, 2]` (the order is not specified).
   - For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops`, if `p1[-1]` (the last element of `p1`) is not equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`.

3. **List `p2`**:
   - `p2` starts empty.
   - For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops`, if `p1[-1]` (the last element of `p1`) is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.

4. **Combining `p1` and `p2`**:
   - `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`.
   - `p1[::-1] + p2` concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.

5. **Formatting the Output**:
   - `' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))` converts each element in the concatenated list to a string and joins them with a space.
   - The final output is formatted as `! [space-separated elements]`.

### Example:
Let's assume `n = 5` and `vx = {2, 4}`. Suppose `ops` is `[(1, 4), (3, 2), (5, 1)]`.

- `p1` starts as `[2, 4]`.
- For the first tuple `(1, 4)`, `p1[-1]` is `4`, which matches `v2`. So, `1` is appended to `p2`.
- For the second tuple `(3, 2)`, `p1[-1]` is `4`, which does not match `v2`. So, `3` is appended to `p1`. Now `p1` is `[2, 4, 3]`.
- For the third tuple `(5, 1)`, `p1[-1]` is `3`, which does not match `v2`. So, `5` is appended to `p1`. Now `p1` is `[2, 4, 3, 5]`.

- `p1[::-1]` is `[5, 3, 4, 2]`.
- `p2` is `[1]`.

- The concatenated list `p1[::-1] + p2` is `[5, 3, 4, 2, 1]`.

- The final output is `! 5 3 4 2 1`.

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the structure of the code, the output will be a string starting with `!` followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order and then the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces.

Output: **! [space-separated elements of p1 in reverse order followed by space-separated elements of p2]** (where `p1` contains the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, and `p2` contains all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`).
