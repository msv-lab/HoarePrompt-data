Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.**

Explanation:
- `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.
- `_` remains 1.
- `vx` is now a set containing all integers from 1 to `int(input())`.
- `ops` is now an empty list.
- `p1` and `p2` retain their definitions based on the initial state, but since `ops` is now an empty list, `p1` will still contain the 2 integers from `vx` and no additional values, and `p2` will still be an empty list.
