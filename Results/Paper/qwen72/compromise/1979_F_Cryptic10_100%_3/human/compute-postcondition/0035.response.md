The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1` and `v2`, and the list `ops`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `ops`. The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must contain at least one more tuple that hasn't been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, and `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the second-to-last tuple in `ops`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple that hasn't been processed, which means `ops` must contain at least three tuples. The next tuple to be processed will be the last tuple in the original `ops` list (which is the first tuple in the reversed list).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `ops` must contain at least three tuples.
- `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the last tuple in the original `ops` list.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and `v1` is appended to it, `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the last tuple in `ops`.**
