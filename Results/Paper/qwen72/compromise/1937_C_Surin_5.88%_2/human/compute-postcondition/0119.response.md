Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 2) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is now 2, and the rest of the initial state remains the same.
