Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`**

Explanation: The code snippet `g = 0` sets the variable `g` to 0. Since `g` was already 0 in the initial state, the value of `g` remains unchanged. All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `v1`, `i`, and `prev`) retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state.
