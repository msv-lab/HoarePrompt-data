The `sys.stdout.flush()` command forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered data is written immediately to the terminal or output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `prev` is 0, `i` is 1**.
