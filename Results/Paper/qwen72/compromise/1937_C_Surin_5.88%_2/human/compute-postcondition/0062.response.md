Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 1, `r` is the user input, and the current value of `r` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 1) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `v1` is now 1, while all other initial conditions remain valid.
