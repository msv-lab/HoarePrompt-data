Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 1.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string in the format `! {prev} {v1}`.
- `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.
- `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`.

### Explanation:
- If there were any inputs that were `>`, `prev` will be the last value of `i` where this condition was met.
- If there were any inputs that were `<`, `v1` will be the last value of `i` where this condition was met.
- If no inputs were `>`, `prev` will be 0.
- If no inputs were `<`, `v1` will be 0.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the values of `prev` and `v1` in the specified format.

Output: **! {prev} {v1} (where prev is the last value of i where the input was >, or 0 if no input was >, and v1 is the last value of i where the input was <, or 0 if no input was <)**
