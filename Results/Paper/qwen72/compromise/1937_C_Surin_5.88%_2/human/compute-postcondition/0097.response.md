Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 3, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 3) to `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `prev` is now 3.
