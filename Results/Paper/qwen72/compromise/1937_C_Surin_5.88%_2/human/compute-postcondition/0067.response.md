The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `v1`, `v2`, `i`, `prev`, `kp`, `n`, and `g` remain unchanged.**
