Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`
   - `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins
   - `prev` is 0

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1`: Since the loop has just started and no input has been processed yet, `v1` is 0.
   - `i`: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
   - `prev`: `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will substitute the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` into the formatted string.
   - The string will be: `? 0 1 0 0`

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **? 0 1 0 0**
