Output State: **After the loop completes all its iterations, `kp` is `t-1` (where `t` is the total number of test cases), `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<` for the final test case, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1` for the final test case, and `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>` for the final test case, or 0 if no input was `>`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `kp` will have reached one less than the total number of test cases (`t-1`), since the loop starts with `kp` at 0 and increments it by 1 for each iteration. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer for the final test case. The variable `g` remains 0 throughout the loop. The variable `v1` will be the last index `i` where the input was `<` during the final test case, or 0 if no input was `<`. The variable `i` will be `n-1` for the final test case, as the loop iterates up to `n-1`. The variable `prev` will be the last index `i` where the input was `>` during the final test case, or 0 if no input was `>`.
