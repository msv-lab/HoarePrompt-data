Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.**

### Explanation:
- **`kp`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`g`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`v1`**: This variable is determined based on the user inputs. If all inputs were `<`, `v1` will be `n-1`. If any input was `>`, `v1` will be the last value of `i` where the input was `>`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`prev`**: This variable tracks the last value of `i` where the input was `>`. If no input was `>`, `prev` remains 0. If there was at least one input that was `>`, `prev` will be the last value of `i` where this occurred.
