To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Variables in the `print` statement:**
   - `v1`: This variable depends on the input conditions. If all inputs were `<`, then `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, it is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.
   - `i`: This is explicitly given as 2.
   - `prev`: This depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1; otherwise, `prev` is 0.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the possible values:

- **`v1`**: Since the exact sequence of inputs is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `v1`. However, we know it could be either `n-1` or some other value of `i` where the input was `<`.
- **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 2.
- **`prev`**: This depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1; otherwise, `prev` is 0.

Since we don't have the exact sequence of inputs or the value of `r`, we can only describe the output in terms of these conditions.

Output: **? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the last value of i where the input was <, or n-1 if all inputs were <, and prev is 1 if r is >, otherwise 0)**
