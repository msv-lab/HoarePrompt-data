Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.**

### Explanation:
- **`kp`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`v1`**: After the loop completes, `v1` will hold the last value of `i` where the input was `<`. If no input was `<`, `v1` remains 0.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`prev`**: Remains the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
