Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`. The loop has executed `n-1` times, and the output buffer has been flushed for each iteration. `prev` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignment of `prev` to 0.
