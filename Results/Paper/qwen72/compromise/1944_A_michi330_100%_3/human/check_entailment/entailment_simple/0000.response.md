### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Logic for Determining Reachable Islands:**
   - The program checks if `k` (the number of bridges that can be destroyed) is greater than or equal to `n - 1` (the minimum number of bridges needed to isolate island 1 from all other islands).
   - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1` because Everule can only visit island 1 (since all other islands can be isolated by destroying `n - 1` bridges).
   - If `k < n - 1`, it prints `n` because Everule can still visit all `n` islands (since it's not possible to isolate island 1 by destroying fewer than `n - 1` bridges).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k = 0` (no bridges are destroyed) correctly by printing `n`.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is the maximum possible value (`n * (n - 1) / 2`), which isolates island 1 from all others, correctly by printing `1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program is logically correct and handles all the given constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
