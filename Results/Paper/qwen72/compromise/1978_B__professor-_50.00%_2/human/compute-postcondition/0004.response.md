Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`). Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The result is calculated as follows: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a`; if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`; otherwise, it prints `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n). After processing all test cases, the function completes and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case are no longer retained. **
