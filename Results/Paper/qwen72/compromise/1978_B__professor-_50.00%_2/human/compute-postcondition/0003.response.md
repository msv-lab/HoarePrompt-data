The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in its signature, but based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters, likely in the form of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function returns different outputs based on the values of these parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters, including `t` (number of test cases) and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` (all integers). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
