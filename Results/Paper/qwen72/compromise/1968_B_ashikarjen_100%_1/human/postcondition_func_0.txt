The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates and prints the maximum length `k` of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. The function does not return any value.
