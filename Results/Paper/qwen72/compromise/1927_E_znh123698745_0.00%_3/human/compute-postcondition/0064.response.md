The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value at the index `a[0]` of the list `array` to the list `answer`.

- `a[0]` is 1.
- `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `array[1]` is the second element of `array`, which is 2 (since the first element is 1).

Therefore, the value 2 is appended to `answer`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
