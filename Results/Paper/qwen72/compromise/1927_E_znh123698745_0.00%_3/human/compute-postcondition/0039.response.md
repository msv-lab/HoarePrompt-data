Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then `answer` is a list that includes the element at the index `a[-1]` from `array`, and the last element of `array` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `answer` is a list with an additional element `array[a[0] - 1]` appended to it.***
