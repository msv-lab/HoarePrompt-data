Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `answer` has one additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] + 1`.** 

In natural language: The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is still an integer greater than 3, `i` is still 3, and `answer` still has one additional element, which is `array[a[0]]` (but note that `a[0]` has now been incremented).
