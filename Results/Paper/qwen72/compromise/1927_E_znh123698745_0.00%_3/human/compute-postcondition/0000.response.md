The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` and `k` does not directly affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the initial state provided. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and k is even, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
