The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, and the list `array`. However, the loop head only modifies `i` and checks the condition against `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive**
