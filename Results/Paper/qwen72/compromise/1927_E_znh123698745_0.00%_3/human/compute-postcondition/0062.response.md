The code `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a`. Initially, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1. After the code is executed, the last element of `a` is decremented by 1, changing it from -1 to -2. The other variables `n`, `i`, `answer`, and `array` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
