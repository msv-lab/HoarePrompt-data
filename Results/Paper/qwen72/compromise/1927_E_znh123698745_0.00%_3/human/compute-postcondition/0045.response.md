Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, and `answer` has a new element appended which is the value of `array[a[-1] + 1]`. Otherwise, `answer` is a list that now includes the element at index `a[0]` of `array`, which has been incremented by 1.***
