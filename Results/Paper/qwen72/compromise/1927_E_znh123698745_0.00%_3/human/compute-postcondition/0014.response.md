Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the last element of `array`.** 

The code appends the last element of `array` to the list `answer`. Since `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the last element of `array` is `n`. Therefore, `answer` now contains the value `n`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `array`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
