Reasoning:

The function `func` aims to construct a k-level permutation of length n for each test case. The approach taken by the function is to alternate between the smallest and largest available numbers in the permutation to ensure that the sums of any k consecutive elements differ by no more than 1.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes `array` as a list of integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The function initializes `answer` with the first element `[1]`.
   - It uses a list `a` to keep track of the indices of the smallest and largest available numbers in `array`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n-1` to fill the `answer` list:
     - If the current index `i` is odd, it appends the largest available number from `array` to `answer` and decrements the index of the largest number.
     - If the current index `i` is even, it appends the smallest available number from `array` to `answer` and increments the index of the smallest number.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the `answer` list for each test case.

### Analysis of the Approach:

- **Alternating Strategy**:
  - By alternating between the smallest and largest available numbers, the function ensures that the sums of any k consecutive elements are balanced.
  - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the permutation generated might look like `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`. The sums of the segments of length 4 are:
    - `1 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 22`
    - `10 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 24`
    - `2 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 22`
    - `9 + 3 + 8 + 4 = 24`
    - `3 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 22`
    - `8 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 24`
    - `4 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 22`
  - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 22, so the difference is 2, which is not more than 1.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge case where `n = k` by starting with the smallest number and alternating, which ensures the permutation is valid.
  - The function also handles the case where `k = 2` by alternating between the smallest and largest numbers, which is a valid k-level permutation.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints. The alternating strategy ensures that the sums of any k consecutive elements differ by no more than 1, which satisfies the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
