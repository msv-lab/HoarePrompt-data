### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, and \( n-2 \) edges are removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query asks for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex not connected to it.
   - The graph is guaranteed to have a Hamiltonian path under these constraints.

2. **Interactive Query Process:**
   - The function `func_1(d)` sends a query to the interactor asking for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex not connected to it.
   - The interactor responds with a pair of integers \((v, u)\), where \( v \) is the vertex with the minimum degree that is at least \( d \), and \( u \) is the vertex with the minimum number that is not connected to \( v \).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func_2(n)` initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
   - For each degree \( d \), it makes a query using `func_1(d)`.
   - If the interactor returns \( v = 0 \), it means no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) exists, and the loop continues.
   - If a valid vertex \( v \) is found, it is added to the path, and removed from the set of remaining vertices.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once by removing it from the set of remaining vertices after it is added.
   - The loop over degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0 ensures that we start with the highest possible degree and work our way down, which helps in finding the correct vertex \( v \) that can be part of the Hamiltonian path.
   - The interactor's response guarantees that the selected vertex \( v \) is the one with the minimum degree and the minimum number, and the vertex \( u \) is the one with the minimum number not connected to \( v \).
   - The algorithm makes at most \( n \) queries, as required by the problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( n = 2 \), the graph is a single edge, and the algorithm will correctly find the Hamiltonian path with one query.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the graph will have one edge removed, and the algorithm will correctly find the Hamiltonian path with two queries.
   - For larger \( n \), the algorithm will continue to work as described, ensuring that the path is Hamiltonian.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the algorithm to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the interactive queries as described. It adheres to the constraints and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
