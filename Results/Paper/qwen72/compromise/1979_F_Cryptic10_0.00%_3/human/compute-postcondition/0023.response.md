Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
- The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `remaining_vertices`, and `path` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `path` includes `v` remains valid if it was true before the `continue` statement.
- The program continues to the next iteration of the loop, so the state of the loop or if statement is also unchanged.
