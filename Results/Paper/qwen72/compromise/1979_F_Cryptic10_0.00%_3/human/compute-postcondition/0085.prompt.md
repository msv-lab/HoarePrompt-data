Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is -1, `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v`, `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v` but still contains at least one vertex, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one vertex.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration, and `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one vertex. If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v` but still contains at least one vertex, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not 0 and not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one vertex.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, and `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration, and `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one vertex. If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v` and has one fewer vertex, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not 0 and not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one vertex. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
