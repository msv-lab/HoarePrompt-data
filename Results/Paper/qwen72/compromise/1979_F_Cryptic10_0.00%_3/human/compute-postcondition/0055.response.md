Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set. `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex. The loop or the next statement after the break is exited.**

The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged, and `v` is still removed from `remaining_vertices`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the loop or the next statement after the break.
