Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` now includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The initial state remains unchanged except for the control flow, which is now outside the loop or if statement.
