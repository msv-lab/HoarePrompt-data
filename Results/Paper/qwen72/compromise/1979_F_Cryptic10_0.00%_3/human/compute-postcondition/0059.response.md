To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `d` and `n`.

1. **Variable `d`**: The loop initializes `d` to `n - 1` and decrements it until it reaches -1. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to -1. This is always true for `n` in the given range (2 <= n <= 10^5), because the smallest value `n` can take is 2, making `n - 1` equal to 1, which is greater than -1.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2, which is already given in the state.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `path` and `remaining_vertices` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the state provided mentions that `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex, which is a condition that should be maintained but does not affect the loop's ability to start.

Given these considerations, the state can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex**
