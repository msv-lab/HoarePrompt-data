The only variables in the loop head are `d` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts with `d` being `n - 1` and decrements `d` until it reaches `-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. However, given the state before the loop, `n` is already defined such that `2 <= n <= 10^5`. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once as long as `n` is within this range.

To ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to set `d` to `n - 1` and confirm that `n` is within the specified range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`**
