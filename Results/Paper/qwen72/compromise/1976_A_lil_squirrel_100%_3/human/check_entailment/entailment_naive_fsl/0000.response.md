Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Condition 1**: The program implicitly checks that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods. If a character is neither a digit nor a lowercase letter, it will not be added to the `letters` or `digits` lists, and the program will still correctly determine the password's strength based on the remaining conditions.

2. **Condition 2**: The program ensures that there is no digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Condition 3**: The program checks if all digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version. If they are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Condition 4**: The program checks if all letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version. If they are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

The program handles all edge cases, such as:
- Passwords with only letters.
- Passwords with only digits.
- Passwords with a mix of letters and digits.
- Passwords of length 1.
- Passwords where letters and digits are intermixed but still meet the conditions.

Given the problem description and the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
