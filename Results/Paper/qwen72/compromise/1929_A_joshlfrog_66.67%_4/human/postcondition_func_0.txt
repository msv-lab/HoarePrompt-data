The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading an integer `l` and a list of `l` integers from the input. For each list, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The function does not return any value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is not affected by the function.
