### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after the array has been rearranged.
   - The beauty of the array is given by the formula: \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The maximum difference between any two elements in the array is \((\max(a_i) - \min(a_i))\).
   - By placing the largest and smallest elements next to each other, we can achieve the maximum possible difference for each pair of consecutive elements.
   - However, the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) can be simplified to \((\max(a_i) - \min(a_i)) \times (n - 1)\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(l\) and the elements of the array \(nums\).
   - It initializes two variables \(x\) and \(y\) to track the maximum and minimum elements in the array, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array to update \(x\) and \(y\) with the maximum and minimum values found.
   - Finally, it prints the difference \(x - y\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
   - However, the program only prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the correct approach to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - The maximum beauty should be \((\max(a_i) - \min(a_i)) \times (n - 1)\), but the program only computes \(\max(a_i) - \min(a_i)\).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined by the problem. It only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

Final: **False**
