Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This ensures that the input is clean and ready for processing, which is essential for the problem.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` and a `balance` variable set to 0. It iterates over the string `s` and for each character:
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to `prefix_balance`.
   - It updates the `balance` by incrementing it if the character is '(', and decrementing it if the character is ')'.
   This step correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence and stores it along with the character's position and the character itself.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom key `(x[0], -x[1])`. This key ensures:
   - The list is sorted by the prefix balance in ascending order.
   - If two characters have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in descending order.
   This sorting step is crucial and correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list. This is done using a list comprehension to extract the characters from the sorted tuples and then joining them into a single string. This step is also correct.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(s)`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string. The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output for the given example.

Given the annotations and the step-by-step reasoning, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input and output as required. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
