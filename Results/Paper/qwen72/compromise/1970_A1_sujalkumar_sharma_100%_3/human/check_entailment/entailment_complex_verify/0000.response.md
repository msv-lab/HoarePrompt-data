Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is consistent with the problem statement, which guarantees that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` and a balance counter `balance` set to 0. It then iterates over each character in the string `s` and appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to `prefix_balance` for each character. The balance is incremented if the character is '(', and decremented if the character is ')'. This correctly computes the prefix balance for each character in the input string.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom key. The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, where `x[0]` is the prefix balance and `-x[1]` is the negative of the position index. This ensures that the list is sorted first by prefix balance in ascending order, and then by position in descending order, which is exactly as described in the problem statement.

4. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list. The characters are extracted from the third element of each tuple in the list, which corresponds to the original character in the input string.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(s)`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character**: The program will correctly handle a single character input, as the prefix balance will be 0 for both '(', and ')', and the position will determine the order.
   - **Equal Numbers of Opening and Closing Parentheses**: The program will correctly handle a string with equal numbers of opening and closing parentheses, as the sorting and concatenation will ensure the output is a valid balanced parentheses sequence.

7. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: The program has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step, where \(n\) is the length of the input string. This is efficient enough for the given constraint of \(n \leq 500,000\).
   - **Space Complexity**: The program uses additional space for the `prefix_balance` list, which is \(O(n)\). This is also within acceptable limits for the given constraint.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation and handles all specified cases and constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
