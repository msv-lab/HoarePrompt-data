### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is responsible for making a query to the interactor.
   - It constructs a query string in the format `"? a b c d"` and prints it with `flush=True` to ensure the query is sent immediately.
   - It then reads the response from the interactor, which is expected to be one of `"<"`, `">"`, or `"="`.
   - The function returns this response.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is designed to find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
   - **Finding the Maximum Item**:
     - The first loop iterates over the range `[1, n)`, comparing the bitwise OR of the current maximum item (`max_item_idx`) with itself against the bitwise OR of the current index (`i`) with itself.
     - If the response is `"<"`, it means `p_i` is larger than `p_max_item_idx`, so `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
     - The second loop iterates over the range `[0, n)`, comparing the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` against the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and the current index (`i`).
     - If the response is `"<"`, it means `p_i` is a better candidate for `pair_idx`, so `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
     - If the response is `"="`, it means `p_i` and `p_pair_idx` are equal, so an additional query is made to compare `p_pair_idx` with `p_i` directly.
     - If the additional query returns `">"`, it means `p_i` is a better candidate for `pair_idx`, so `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - **Outputting the Result**:
     - After the loops, the function prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.

### Analysis:
- **Finding the Maximum Item**:
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum item in the permutation `p` by comparing `p_i` with `p_max_item_idx` using the bitwise OR operation.
  - This is a valid approach because the bitwise OR of an item with itself is the item itself, and the comparison will correctly identify the larger item.

- **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
  - The second loop aims to find the index `pair_idx` such that `p_max_item_idx ⊕ p_pair_idx` is maximized.
  - The loop compares `p_max_item_idx | p_pair_idx` with `p_max_item_idx | p_i` to determine if `p_i` is a better candidate for `pair_idx`.
  - If the bitwise OR values are equal, an additional query is made to compare `p_pair_idx` with `p_i` directly.
  - This approach is correct because the bitwise OR operation can help identify the relative sizes of the items, and the additional query ensures that the correct index is chosen when the OR values are equal.

- **Query Count**:
  - The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
  - The second loop makes at most `n` queries (one for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`).
  - The total number of queries is `2n-1`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

- **Output**:
  - The final output is in the correct format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and uses the allowed number of queries to find a pair of indices such that the bitwise XOR of the corresponding elements in the permutation is maximized. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
