The function `func_1` accepts four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p`. It prints a query string formatted as `"? {a} {b} {c} {d}"` to the console and then returns the user's input as a string. The user's input is expected to be a string formatted similarly, but the function does not enforce this format.
