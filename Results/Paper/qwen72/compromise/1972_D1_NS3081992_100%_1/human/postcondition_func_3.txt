The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing `rows_number` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_3()`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned list has `rows_number` instances of whatever `func_3()` returns, and `rows_number` remains unchanged.
