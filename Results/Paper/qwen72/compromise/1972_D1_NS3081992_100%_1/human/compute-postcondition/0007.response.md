Functionality: ** The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It decrements `k` by the total of (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list `a` up to index `n-1` where a[i] is less than `m`. After processing, the function returns 1 if `k` is non-negative, otherwise it returns -1. The list `a`, integer `n`, and positive integer `m` remain unchanged, while `k` is modified as described. **
