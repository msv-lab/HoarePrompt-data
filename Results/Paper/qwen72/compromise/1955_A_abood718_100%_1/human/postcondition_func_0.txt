The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on the following conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2` (as an integer); if `A` is odd, it prints `(A // 2) * C + B`. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` provided before the function call. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
