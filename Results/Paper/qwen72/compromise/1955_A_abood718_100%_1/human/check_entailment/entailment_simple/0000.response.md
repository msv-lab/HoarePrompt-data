Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case. This is appropriate for the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case, which represent `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. This is correct as per the problem's input format.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. The program prints `A * B` which is the total cost for `A` yogurts at the regular price. This is correct.
   - **Case 2**: If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even and the promotion price is cheaper or equal to the regular price for two yogurts, the program prints `int(A * C / 2)`. This is the total cost for `A` yogurts bought in pairs at the promotion price. This is correct.
   - **Case 3**: If `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost for the maximum number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (`X = A // 2`), and then adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price (`B`). The program prints `X * C + B`. This is correct.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum cost to buy `A` yogurts. This matches the problem's output requirement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `A` is 1 (odd) by printing `B`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `A` is 2 (even) by printing `C` if `C` is cheaper than `2 * B`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `A` is greater than 2 and both even and odd scenarios.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
