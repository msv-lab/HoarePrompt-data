Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly decodes the encoded string as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Test Cases**: The program processes each test case by:
   - Reading the length of the encoded string `n`.
   - Reading the encoded string `b`.

3. **Decoding Function**: The function `func_1` performs the decoding:
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - It constructs a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list.
   - It decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the decoded string for each test case.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles the constraints appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
