### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the length `n` and encoded string `b` for each test case.
   - The index `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list, ensuring that the program processes each test case correctly.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
     - `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` correctly creates a sorted list of unique characters in the encoded string `b`.
     - This step ensures that the auxiliary string `r` is constructed as required, with characters in alphabetical order.
   - **Character Mapping:**
     - `char_map = {}` initializes an empty dictionary to store the character mappings.
     - The loop `for i in range(len_unique):` iterates over the unique characters and maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in the list.
     - `char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` correctly sets up the symmetric mapping.
   - **Decoding:**
     - `decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)` constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding value in `char_map`.
     - This step ensures that the decoding process is performed as described in the problem statement.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly prints the decoded strings for each test case after processing all test cases.

4. **Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**
   - **Single Character Strings:**
     - For a single character string, `unique_chars` will contain only one character, and the symmetric mapping will map that character to itself. This is correct according to the problem description.
   - **Strings with Repeated Characters:**
     - The program handles repeated characters correctly by mapping each occurrence to its symmetric counterpart.
   - **Empty Input:**
     - The problem guarantees that the input will be valid and non-empty, so the program does not need to handle empty strings.
   - **Performance:**
     - The program's time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step, which is efficient enough given the constraints \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all specified inputs and edge cases. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` correctly, creates the symmetric character mapping, and decodes the string as required.

Final: **True**
