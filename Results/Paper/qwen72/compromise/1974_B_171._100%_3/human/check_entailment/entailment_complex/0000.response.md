Reasoning:

The program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a sorted list of unique characters from the original string and then replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric counterpart in this sorted list.

### Key Points to Check for Correctness:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the length `n` and encoded string `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
     - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` and extracts the unique characters, sorts them, and stores them in `unique_chars`.
   - **Character Mapping:**
     - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in the list.
   - **Decoding:**
     - The function then decodes the string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding value in `char_map`.
   - **Return Value:**
     - The decoded string is returned.

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the decoded string for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Example Test Case:**
  - For the input `encoded = "serofedsoc"`, the unique characters are `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']`.
  - The symmetric mapping is:
    - 'c' -> 's'
    - 'd' -> 'r'
    - 'e' -> 'o'
    - 'f' -> 'f'
    - 'o' -> 'e'
    - 'r' -> 'd'
    - 's' -> 'c'
  - Applying this mapping to the encoded string `serofedsoc` results in `codeforces`, which is the correct output.

- **Other Test Cases:**
  - The program should handle other test cases similarly, ensuring that the unique characters are correctly mapped and the decoding is performed as described.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as expected and performs the decoding correctly for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
