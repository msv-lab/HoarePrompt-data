Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, and `mexsize` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mexsize = 1` updates the value of `mexsize` to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `mexsize` was the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`, but now it is explicitly set to 1. The conditions regarding `t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, and `maxsize` remain valid as they were not affected by the code snippet.
