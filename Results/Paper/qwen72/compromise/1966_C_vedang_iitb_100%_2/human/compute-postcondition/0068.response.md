The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function will return some form of output for each test case, likely related to the number of stones in the piles.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
