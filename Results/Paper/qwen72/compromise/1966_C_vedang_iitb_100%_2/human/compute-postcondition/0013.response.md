Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input with at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`. If `sz` is 1, `mexsize` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.***
