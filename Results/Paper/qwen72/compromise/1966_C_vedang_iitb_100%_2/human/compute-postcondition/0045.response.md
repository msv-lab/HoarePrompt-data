The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 1, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the condition holds as is. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the condition also holds as is.**
