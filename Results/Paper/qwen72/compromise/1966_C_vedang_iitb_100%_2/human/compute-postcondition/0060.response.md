Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least three elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, and `sz` is the third element of `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.***
