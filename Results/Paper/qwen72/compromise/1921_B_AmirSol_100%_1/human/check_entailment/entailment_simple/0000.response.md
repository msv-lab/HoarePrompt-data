Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (denoted by `s1`) into the desired state (denoted by `s2`). The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The key insight is that the minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two values. This is because:
- If more cats need to be added than removed, the extra cats must be added one by one.
- If more cats need to be removed than added, the extra cats must be removed one by one.
- If the number of cats to add and remove is the same, each cat can be moved from a box where it needs to be removed to a box where it needs to be added, or the cats can be added and removed independently.

The function correctly counts the number of positions where a cat needs to be added and the number of positions where a cat needs to be removed. It then returns the maximum of these two counts, which is the correct minimum number of operations required.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
