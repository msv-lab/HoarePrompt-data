The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The function returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It returns the maximum number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, either by `s1` having '0' and `s2` having '1', or by `s1` having '1' and `s2` having '0'.**
