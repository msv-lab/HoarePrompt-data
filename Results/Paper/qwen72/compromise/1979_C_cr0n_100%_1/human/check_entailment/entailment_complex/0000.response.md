Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2()`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It is used to find the LCM of the multipliers `k_i` in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - **Calculating LCM**:
     - It initializes `den` with the first element of `vals`.
     - It iterates over `vals` and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current element `x`.
   - **Calculating Bets**:
     - It computes `vprod` where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
     - It then calculates `den` as `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - **Checking Validity**:
     - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating no valid distribution of coins.
     - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **LCM Calculation**:
     - The LCM of the multipliers is calculated correctly using `func_1`.
   - **Bets Calculation**:
     - The bets are calculated as `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
     - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(vprod)`.
     - The condition for a valid distribution is that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - **Validation**:
     - The program checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0`.
     - If this condition is met, the distribution is valid, and the program prints the bets.
     - If the condition is not met, the program prints `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`), the LCM will be the same as the multiplier, and the sum of the bets will be equal to `N * (den // r)`, which will not satisfy the condition `den > sum(vprod)`.
   - For other cases, the program should correctly find a valid distribution if one exists.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for each test case.
   - It handles the edge case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.

Correctness: **True**
