Postcondition: **`den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `vals` minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`, `vals` remains unchanged, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of the original `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`, and `den` is greater than 0.**
