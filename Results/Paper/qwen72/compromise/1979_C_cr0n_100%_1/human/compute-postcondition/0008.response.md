Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `vals` minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`.
   - `vals` remains unchanged.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of the original `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state.
   - It simply prints the integer `-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a constant value `-1`, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
