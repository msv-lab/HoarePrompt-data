The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one integer, and `num` should be the first integer in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
