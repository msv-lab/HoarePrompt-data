You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the minimum of `k` and the number of times that integer appears in `arr`. The function ensures that no value in the dictionary exceeds `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the operations is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
1 1 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
- The input consists of 5 cards, where 3 cards have the number 1 and 2 cards have the number 2.
- According to the problem description, you can choose 3 cards with the same number (in this case, the 3 cards with the number 1) and exchange them for 2 cards with any number. After this operation, you will have 2 cards with the number 2 and 2 new cards, resulting in a total of 4 cards.
- You can then choose 2 cards with the number 2 and exchange them for 1 card with any number. After this operation, you will have 3 cards left.
- Since you can perform the operation again with the 3 cards, you can exchange them for 2 cards, resulting in a total of 2 cards left.
- However, the program incorrectly outputs 5, which is the initial number of cards.

The issue lies in the logic that checks the frequency of the cards and the conditions for performing the operations. The program does not correctly simulate the process of exchanging cards and minimizing the number of cards left.
