Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `k` with the specified conditions. `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the current window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the current window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nabors` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer greater than `m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`, `_` is a placeholder, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the new user input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the current window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the current window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` for each window, otherwise `fnd` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer greater than `m`, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `aa` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in the new `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the current window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in the new `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the current window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the new `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
