Output State: **The program returns True.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is calculated as `k * b + (n - k) * a`.
- The return statement checks if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.
- Since `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), and `a` and `b` are positive integers, the expression `k * b + (n - k) * a` will always be less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.
- This is because the maximum value `ans` can take is when `k` is either 0 or `n`, and in both cases, `ans` will be equal to `n * a` or `n * b`, which are both less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.
- Therefore, the program always returns True.
