### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob has `n` buns to sell.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the optimal `k`.
   - The binary search is performed on the range `[0, n]`.
   - The function `func_1(k, a, b, n)` is used to determine if the chosen `k` is valid.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the total profit if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - It then checks if this total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.
   - The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not the correct condition to determine the optimal `k`. Instead, the function should return the maximum profit directly.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is used to find the maximum `k` that satisfies the condition.
   - However, the condition used in `func_1` is incorrect for determining the optimal `k`.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the profit for each `k` and keep track of the maximum profit.

5. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be to compare the profit for the current `k` with the maximum profit found so far.
   - The function should return the maximum profit directly, and the binary search should be used to find the `k` that maximizes this profit.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum `k` found during the binary search.
   - However, the problem requires the maximum profit, not the value of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect condition in the binary search and does not correctly calculate the maximum profit. The function `func_1` should return the profit for a given `k`, and the main loop should keep track of the maximum profit found.

### Correctness:
**False**
