Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The binary search approach used in the program is unnecessary and the logic within `func_1` is flawed. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the profit for a given `k`, but it incorrectly checks if the profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the condition we need to maximize the profit.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the profit for different values of `k` and find the maximum profit. The profit calculation should be based on the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This program iterates over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and calculates the profit for each value of `k`. It then prints the maximum profit found. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the correct maximum profit is calculated for each test case.
