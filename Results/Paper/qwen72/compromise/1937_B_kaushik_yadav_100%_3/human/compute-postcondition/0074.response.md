To determine what will be printed by the `print(counter)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop.
   - `j` is the last index of `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`).
   - `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.

2. **Understanding the Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to `len(a) - 2`, which means it starts at the second-to-last index of `a`.
   - `counter` is incremented for each consecutive match between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]`.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - The `print(counter)` statement will output the value of `counter`, which is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` starting from the second-to-last index of `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `counter`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of consecutive matches between the characters of `a` and `b` as described.

Output: **counter (where counter is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` starting from the second-to-last index of `a`)**
