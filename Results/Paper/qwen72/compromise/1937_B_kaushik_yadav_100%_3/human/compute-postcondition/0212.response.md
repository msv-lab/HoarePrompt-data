Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty and have at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is 1, `work` is either True or False depending on the loop conditions. If the third character of `a` (i.e., `a[j + 1]`) is equal to the first character of `b` (i.e., `b[j]`), `counter` is 3 or 2. If the third character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
