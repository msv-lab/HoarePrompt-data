Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is set to read input from `stdin` using the `readline` method. The initial state remains unchanged except for the method used to read input. The function will still accept multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `t` is now assigned the value of an integer read from `stdin` using the `readline` method.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `j` is the last index of `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last comparison, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters in `a` starting from the second character that match the corresponding characters in `b` (or reset to 1 if a '0' in `a` matches a '1' in `b`), `work` is either True or False depending on the loop conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
