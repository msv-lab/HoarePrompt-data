Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` or `b` followed by the second character of `a` and the character `a[i]`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented to 2 and `work` is False. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented to 2 and `work` remains True. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, the second character of `b` is appended to `ans` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
