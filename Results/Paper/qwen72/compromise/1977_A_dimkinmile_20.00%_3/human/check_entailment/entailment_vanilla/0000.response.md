Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

3. **Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic is based on the idea that if `n` is at least as large as `m`, Nikita can always achieve a tower with exactly `m` cubes by putting `m` cubes on the tower in `m` moves and then doing nothing in the remaining `n - m` moves.
   - However, this logic is incomplete. The problem requires that Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, and the tower starts with zero cubes. Therefore, the number of moves `n` must be at least `m` and the difference `n - m` must be even to ensure that the tower can end up with exactly `m` cubes.

5. **Missing Condition**:
   - The program does not check if the difference `n - m` is even. This is crucial because if `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n - m`.

Correctness: **False**
