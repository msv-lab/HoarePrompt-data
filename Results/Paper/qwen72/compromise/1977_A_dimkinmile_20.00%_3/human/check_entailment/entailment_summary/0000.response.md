Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine if it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't consider the nature of the moves. Specifically, the number of moves `n` must be at least as large as the number of cubes `m` and must also be of the same parity (both even or both odd) for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes. This is because each move can only add or remove one cube, and the parity of the number of moves will determine the final parity of the number of cubes in the tower.

For example:
- If `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the program correctly outputs "Yes" because Nikita can add 3 cubes in 3 moves.
- If `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" because it's impossible to add 4 cubes in 2 moves.
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the program correctly outputs "Yes" because Nikita can add 3 cubes and then remove 2 cubes (or add 4 cubes and remove 1 cube).

The correct logic should check if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `n` and `m` have the same parity.

Correctness: **False**
