Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

3. **Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic is incomplete. The program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, but it does not consider the parity of `n - m`.
   - The problem requires that Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, and the tower starts with zero cubes. Therefore, for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move changes the height of the tower by 1, and starting from 0, the height of the tower will be even after an even number of moves and odd after an odd number of moves.

5. **Missing Condition**:
   - The program does not check if `n - m` is even. This is a crucial condition that must be met for the tower to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - For example, in the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program incorrectly prints "No" because it only checks `n >= m`. However, the correct answer should be "No" because `n - m = 2 - 4 = -2` is even, but `n < m` is not sufficient to determine the result.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n - m`.

Final: **False**
