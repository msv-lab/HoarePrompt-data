The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least one integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `results` is an empty list, which does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `test_cases` must have at least one integer, and `x` will be the first integer in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `results` is an empty list**
