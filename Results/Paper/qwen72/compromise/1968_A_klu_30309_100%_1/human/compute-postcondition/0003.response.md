Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**

The variable `best_y` is now assigned the value 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
