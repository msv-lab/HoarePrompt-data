Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list and must be at least 4, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
- The value of `x` is the first integer in the list `test_cases` and must be at least 4.
- `y` is `x - 3`.
- `current_sum` is calculated as `gcd_val + y`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.
- The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`) are not affected by this code snippet.
