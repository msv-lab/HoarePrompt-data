Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `best_y` is `x - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`.
- Since `y` is already `x - 2`, `best_y` is also `x - 2`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
- The initial state is fully preserved, with the only change being the explicit assignment of `best_y` to `x - 2`.
