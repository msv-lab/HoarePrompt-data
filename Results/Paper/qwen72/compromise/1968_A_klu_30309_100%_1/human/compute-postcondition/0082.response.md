Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each integer in `test_cases`, where `best_y` is 1 for each integer in `test_cases`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged. The `results` list will contain the value of `best_y` for each integer in `test_cases`. According to the loop, `best_y` is always set to 1 for each `x` in `test_cases` because the loop breaks after the first iteration of the inner loop, where `y` is `x - 1`. This means that the first value of `y` is always the one that is appended to `results`, and since the loop breaks immediately, `best_y` is always 1. Therefore, the `results` list will contain the value 1 for each integer in `test_cases`.
