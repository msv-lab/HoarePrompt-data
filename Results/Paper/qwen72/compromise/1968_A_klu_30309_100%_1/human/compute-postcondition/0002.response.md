Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0.** 

The variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
