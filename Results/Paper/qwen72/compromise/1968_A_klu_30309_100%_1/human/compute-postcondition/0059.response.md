Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y` (which is 1), `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
- Since `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` will be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.
