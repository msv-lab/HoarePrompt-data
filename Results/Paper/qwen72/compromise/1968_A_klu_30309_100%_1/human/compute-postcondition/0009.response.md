Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `y` starts at `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation:
- `best_y` is assigned the value of `y`.
- The value of `y` is `x - 1`.
- Therefore, `best_y` is now `x - 1`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
