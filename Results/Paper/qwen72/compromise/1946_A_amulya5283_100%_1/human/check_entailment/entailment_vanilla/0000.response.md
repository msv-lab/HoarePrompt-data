### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
   - An operation consists of increasing any element of the array by 1.
   - The median is defined as the middle element of the sorted array for odd lengths, and the middle element of the first half of the sorted array for even lengths.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then sorts the array and calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
     - For odd `n`, `mdx` is the middle index.
     - For even `n`, `mdx` is the last index of the first half.
   - This calculation is correct for finding the median index in a sorted array.

4. **Operation Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of operations.
   - It then iterates from `mdx` to `n-1` and checks if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.
   - If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, it increments `res` by 1.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not actually count the operations needed to increase the median. Instead, it counts the number of elements equal to the current median in the second half of the array.

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - To increase the median, we need to find the smallest element in the second half of the sorted array that is greater than the current median and calculate the number of operations required to make the current median equal to this element.
   - The correct approach would be to find the next greater element in the sorted array and calculate the difference between this element and the current median.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. It incorrectly counts the number of elements equal to the current median in the second half of the array, which does not solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
