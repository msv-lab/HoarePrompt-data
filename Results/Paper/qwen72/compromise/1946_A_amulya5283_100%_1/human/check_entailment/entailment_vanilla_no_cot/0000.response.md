Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the way it calculates the number of operations required to increase the median. Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Median Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the median index `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` for an array of length `n`. This is correct for both even and odd lengths.

2. **Operation Counting**: The program then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array and increments the result `res` for each element that is equal to the median. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the actual number of operations needed to increase the median. Instead, it counts the number of elements that are equal to the median, which is not the same as the number of operations required to increase the median.

3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
   - Identify the median element.
   - Determine the smallest number greater than the median that can be used to increase the median.
   - Calculate the number of operations required to make the median element equal to this next number.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            median = a[mdx]
            next_val = median + 1
            while mdx < n and a[mdx] == median:
                next_val += 1
                mdx += 1
            if mdx == n:
                print(1)
            else:
                operations = next_val - median
                print(operations)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Median Calculation**: The median index `mdx` is correctly calculated as `n // 2` for an array of length `n`.
2. **Next Value Calculation**: The program determines the smallest number greater than the median that can be used to increase the median. This is done by incrementing `next_val` until it finds a value that is not equal to the median.
3. **Operation Counting**: The number of operations required to increase the median is calculated as `next_val - median`.

This corrected program should correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
