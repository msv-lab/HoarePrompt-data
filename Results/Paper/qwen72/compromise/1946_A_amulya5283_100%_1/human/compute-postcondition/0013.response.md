Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `res` is 1, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`, and the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`.** 

The value of `res` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
