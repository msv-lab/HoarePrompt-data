Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `t`, `n`, or `a`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.***
