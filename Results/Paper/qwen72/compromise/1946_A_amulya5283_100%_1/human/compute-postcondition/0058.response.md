The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`, if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 2, otherwise `res` is 1.
