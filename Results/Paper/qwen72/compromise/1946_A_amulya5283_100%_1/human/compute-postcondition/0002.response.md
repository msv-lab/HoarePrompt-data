Output State: **`t` is an input integer and `t` must be greater than 0, `t` is now `t - 1`**. 

This means that the value of `t` has been decreased by 1, but it still needs to be greater than 0. If `t` was initially 1, it is now 0, and if it was greater than 1, it is now one less than its initial value.
