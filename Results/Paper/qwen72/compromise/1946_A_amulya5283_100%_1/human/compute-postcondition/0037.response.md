The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `i`) remain unchanged. Since `res` was initially 0 or 1, it is now 1 or 2, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a` and must be at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is 1 or 2 depending on the previous iteration's condition.**
