Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` set to 0, `n` set to the last input integer, and `a` set to the last sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, the function prints 1 for that test case. If `n` is greater than 1, the function prints the number of elements in `a` from the median index to the end of the list that are equal to the median value. **
