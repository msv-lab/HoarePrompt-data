Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the last index of the list `a`, which is `n - 1`. The variable `res` will have been incremented for each element from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that is equal to the element at index `mdx`. Thus, `res` will hold the count of how many elements in the list `a` from `mdx` to `n - 1` are equal to `a[mdx]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
