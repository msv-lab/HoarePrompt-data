Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
