To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `mdx` is less than `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer minus 3 (this variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is the length of the sorted list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `res` is 0 (this variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

Let's break it down:
1. **`i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop and starts at `mdx`.
2. **`mdx`**: This variable is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute, `mdx` must be less than `n`.
3. **`n`**: This variable represents the length of the list `a`.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `mdx` must be less than `n`.
- `i` will start at `mdx`.

Let's verify the condition:
- If `n` is 0, `mdx` will be `-1` (since `0 // 2 + 0 % 2 - 1 = -1`), and the loop will not execute.
- If `n` is 1, `mdx` will be `0` (since `1 // 2 + 1 % 2 - 1 = 0`), and the loop will execute once.
- If `n` is 2, `mdx` will be `0` (since `2 // 2 + 2 % 2 - 1 = 0`), and the loop will execute twice.
- If `n` is 3, `mdx` will be `1` (since `3 // 2 + 3 % 2 - 1 = 1`), and the loop will execute twice.
- If `n` is 4, `mdx` will be `1` (since `4 // 2 + 4 % 2 - 1 = 1`), and the loop will execute three times.
- If `n` is 5, `mdx` will be `2` (since `5 // 2 + 5 % 2 - 1 = 2`), and the loop will execute three times.

From the above, we can see that for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Additionally, `i` will start at `mdx`, which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` starts at `mdx`.

State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a` and must be at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` starts at `mdx`**
