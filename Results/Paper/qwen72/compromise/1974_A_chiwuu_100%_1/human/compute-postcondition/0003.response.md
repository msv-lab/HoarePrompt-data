The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function might internally handle or generate test cases involving integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 99, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value without additional information. However, we can infer that the function is likely designed to process these test cases and return some result based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.**
