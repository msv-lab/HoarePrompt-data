You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password, and digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password. The variable n remains unchanged.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password, and digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password. The variable n remains unchanged. The list letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password, and digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password. The variable n remains unchanged. The list letters is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the lists `letters` or `digits`, and the variable `n` remains unchanged. The loop checks for the condition where a letter is followed by a digit in the string `password`. If this condition is met at any point, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes all iterations without finding such a pattern, the function will not return anything explicitly, and the output state will be the same as the initial state.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the loop completes all iterations without finding a letter followed by a digit in the string `password`. If a letter is followed by a digit at any point, the function returns 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions:

1. **Character Type Check**: The program separates the characters into two lists, `letters` and `digits`, which ensures that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Sorting Check**: It checks if the `letters` and `digits` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
3. **Order of Characters**: It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter in the password. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

The program handles all potential edge cases, including:
- Passwords with only letters.
- Passwords with only digits.
- Passwords with both letters and digits, ensuring that letters are sorted before any digits.
- Passwords of different lengths (from 1 to 20).

Given these checks, the program should work correctly for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
