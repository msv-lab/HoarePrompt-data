The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `len(password) - 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute, the expression `len(password) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(password)` must be at least 1. However, since the loop iterates up to `len(password) - 1`, `len(password)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

Before the loop starts, the variable `i` is not yet defined, so it should start at 0. The lists `letters` and `digits` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `len(password)` must be at least 2**
