Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input `2 6`. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the 2x6 rectangle into two 2x3 rectangles and then form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 rectangle. However, the program does not correctly identify this case and outputs "no" instead of "yes".

The issue lies in the logic used to determine if another rectangle can be formed. The conditions in the program are not correctly capturing the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true for any non-zero difference between `a` and `b`, which is incorrect. The correct logic should check if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even, as this would allow Bob to cut the rectangle and form a different one.
