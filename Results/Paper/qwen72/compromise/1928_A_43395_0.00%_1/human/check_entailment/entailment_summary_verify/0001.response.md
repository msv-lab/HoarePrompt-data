### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He wants to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, which can be rotated and moved.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The output should be "Yes" if Bob can form a different rectangle, otherwise "No".

3. **Conditions for Forming a Different Rectangle**:
   - If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can always form a different rectangle by cutting the even side in half and rearranging the resulting rectangles.
   - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because cutting an odd side will result in non-integer sides, and cutting an even side is not possible.

4. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \) for each test case.
   - The first condition checks if both \( a \) and \( b \) are even. If so, it prints "yes". This condition is correct.
   - The second condition checks if \( (a - b == -a, a) \) or \( (b - a == -b, b) \). This condition is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. It should be removed.
   - The third condition checks if \( (a - b) \% 2 \) is greater than 0 or less than 0. This condition is always true for any non-zero \( a \) and \( b \), making it redundant.
   - The fourth condition prints "no" if none of the above conditions are met. This condition is correct.

5. **Corrected Program**:
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can form a different rectangle.
     - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it contains redundant and incorrect conditions. The corrected program provided above is the correct implementation of the logic needed to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
