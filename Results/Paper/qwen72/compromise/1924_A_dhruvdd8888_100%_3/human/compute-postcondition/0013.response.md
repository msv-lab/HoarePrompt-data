To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `us`. The loop will execute if `us` is not empty, as it will iterate over each element in `us`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` remains unchanged
- `m` remains unchanged
- `s` remains unchanged
- `us` remains unchanged
- `win` is an empty set
- `ans` contains the characters that were the `k`-th unique characters from `us` found in `s` in the order they appeared
- `ps` is the number of times a `k`-th unique character from `us` was found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `us` to ensure it is not empty. The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `us` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` must be a non-empty set, `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains the characters that were the `k`-th unique characters from `us` found in `s` in the order they appeared, `ps` is the number of times a `k`-th unique character from `us` was found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is the first element of `us`**
