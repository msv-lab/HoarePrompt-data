Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `n`: Remains unchanged (its value is not specified).
   - `k`: Remains unchanged (its value is not specified).
   - `m`: Remains unchanged (its value is not specified).
   - `s`: Remains unchanged (its value is not specified).
   - `us`: Remains unchanged (its value is not specified).
   - `win`: An empty set.
   - `ans`: Contains the characters that were the `k`-th unique characters from `us` found in `s` in the order they appeared.
   - `ps`: The number of times a `k`-th unique character from `us` was found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.

2. **Code snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement is not using any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **NO**
