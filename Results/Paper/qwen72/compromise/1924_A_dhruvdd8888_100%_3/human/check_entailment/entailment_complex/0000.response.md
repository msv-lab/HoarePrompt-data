### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, and then reads the string `s`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It also initializes an empty set `win` and an empty list `ans` to keep track of the characters found and the answer, respectively.

2. **Processing the String `s`:**
   - The function iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it adds `i` to the set `win`.
   - If the set `win` contains all `k` unique characters, it appends `i` to the list `ans`, increments `ps` by 1, and clears the set `win`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - After processing the string `s`, the function checks if `ps` (the number of times a `k`-th unique character was found) is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO'.
   - It then tries to find a character in `us` that is not in `win` and constructs a string that consists of the characters in `ans`, the first unique character from `us` that is not in `win`, and then pads with `a` characters to reach a total length of `n`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Subsequence Check:**
   - The function is not correctly checking if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The current logic only checks if there are at least `n` occurrences of a `k`-th unique character, which is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Construction of the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The function attempts to construct a missing subsequence by appending a character not in `win` and padding with `a` characters. This approach may not always produce a valid missing subsequence.
   - The correct approach would be to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
