### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It maintains a set `win` to track the characters in the current window.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and adds characters to `win` if they are in `us`.
   - When `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the current character to `ans` and clears `win`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - If the length of `ans` is at least `n`, it prints "YES" and returns.
   - If not, it prints "NO" and then constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` by:
     - Finding a character in `us` that is not in `win`.
     - Appending this character to `ans` and padding the rest with 'a' to make the string length `n`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
   - The program's logic for checking subsequences is flawed. It only checks if the current window contains all `k` characters, but it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - The set `win` is cleared after each successful addition to `ans`, which means it does not maintain a continuous subsequence check.

2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program constructs a missing subsequence by appending a character not in `win` and padding with 'a'. This approach is not guaranteed to produce a valid missing subsequence.
   - For example, if `s` is "abb" and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program might incorrectly output "aa" as a missing subsequence, even though "aa" is not a valid subsequence of "abb".

3. **Logical Flow:**
   - The function `func_1` is called within a loop, but the loop itself is not defined. This will cause a runtime error because `func_1` is not defined before it is called.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
