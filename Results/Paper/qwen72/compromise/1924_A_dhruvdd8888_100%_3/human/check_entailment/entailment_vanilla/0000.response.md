### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input.
   - It reads the string `s` of length `m`.
   - It creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It initializes an empty set `win` and an empty list `ans` to keep track of the subsequences and the answer, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `ps` to count the number of valid subsequences.

3. **Subsequence Checking:**
   - The program iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it adds `i` to the set `win`.
   - If the set `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends `i` to the list `ans`, increments the counter `ps`, and clears the set `win`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - If the counter `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints `YES` and returns.
   - If the counter `ps` is less than `n`, it prints `NO`.
   - It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`:
     - It finds a character `i` in `us` that is not in `win`.
     - It appends this character to the list `ans` and fills the rest of the string with 'a' characters to make it of length `n`.

### Issues and Incorrectness:

1. **Subsequence Checking Logic:**
   - The logic for checking subsequences is flawed. The program only checks if a set of `k` characters can be found in the string `s` and then clears the set. This does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked as subsequences.
   - For example, in the string `abba` with `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program will only find the subsequences `ab` and `ba` but will not check for `aa` and `bb`.

2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program constructs a missing subsequence by appending a character not in `win` and filling the rest with 'a'. This approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid missing subsequence.
   - For example, if `s = "abb"` and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program might incorrectly construct `aa` as a missing subsequence, even though `aa` is not a valid subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness:
- **Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly check all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It also does not construct a valid missing subsequence in the case where the answer is `NO`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
