The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` and `t` are integers where `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `t = 1`. `edges` is a list that will be populated with pairs of integers `(u, v)` where `1 <= u, v <= n`, representing the edges of a tree. `start` is an integer where `1 <= start <= n`, representing the starting node for the game.

The function returns the result of the game based on the starting node and the structure of the tree defined by the edges.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `start`. It returns the result of a game that starts from the node `start` in a tree defined by the edges, where `n` is the number of nodes, `t` is a fixed integer set to 1, and `edges` is a list of pairs representing the tree's edges.**
