The function `func_1` accepts a tree represented as a list of lists `nodes`, an integer `start` (1 ≤ start ≤ n) representing the starting node, and an integer or None `parent` representing the parent node. It returns a list of distances from the starting node to all its descendants in the tree, where each distance is incremented by 1. If the starting node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is its parent), the function returns a list containing the single element 0. The `nodes`, `start`, and `parent` variables remain unchanged.
