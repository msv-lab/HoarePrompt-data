Postcondition: ***`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (before any changes) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. `D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, `n`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa` retain their previous values. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next elements in the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`, respectively, and these slices must have at least one more element. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then either `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 (regardless of the value of `D[out_aa]`), or `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.***
