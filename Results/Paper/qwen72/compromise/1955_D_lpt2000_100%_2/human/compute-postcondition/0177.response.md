Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (before the increment) was greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` > 0; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`) retain their previous values.**
