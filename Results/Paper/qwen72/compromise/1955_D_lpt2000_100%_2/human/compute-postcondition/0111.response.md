Output State: **`fnd` remains the same or is incremented by 1 depending on the condition, `D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, and `n` remain the same, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state.
