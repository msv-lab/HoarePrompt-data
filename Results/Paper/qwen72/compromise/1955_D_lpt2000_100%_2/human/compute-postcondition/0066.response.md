Output State: **`aa` is a list of strings representing the input elements, `fnd` will be the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `D`, `E`, and `C` will reflect the final state of the counters after processing all elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`, `pairs_in_D` will be the sum of the values in `D` after the final iteration, `nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `bb` is a list of strings representing the input elements split from the user input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency count of the first `m` elements in `aa`.**
