Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `nabors` must be greater than 0, `aa` is a list of strings representing the input values, `bb` is a list of strings from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution, `fnd` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution, `fnd` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively, and both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one more element each. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
