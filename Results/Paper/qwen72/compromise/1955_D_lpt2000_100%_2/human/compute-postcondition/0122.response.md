To determine what will be printed by the `print(fnd)` statement, we need to understand the value of the variable `fnd` based on the initial state provided. However, the initial state does not provide any specific details about the variable `fnd` or how it is initialized or modified. 

Given the lack of specific information about `fnd`, we can only make a general statement about what will be printed.

Output: **fnd (where fnd is the value of the variable fnd after all iterations of the loop)**

If more context or details about the initialization and modification of `fnd` were provided, we could give a more precise answer. For example, if `fnd` was initialized to a specific value or modified in a specific way within the loop, we would be able to describe its final value more accurately.
