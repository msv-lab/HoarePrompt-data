Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input and then calls the `solve` function that many times. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the `solve` function has been executed a number of times equal to the integer input read from `sys.stdin`. No other variables are affected by the execution of `func_1`. **
