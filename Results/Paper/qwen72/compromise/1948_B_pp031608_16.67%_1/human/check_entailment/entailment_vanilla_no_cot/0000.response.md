Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine if the array can be made sorted by performing the specified operations. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Usage of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list is already sorted. However, it is called before and after the loop, which is not the correct approach to determine if the array can be sorted by the operations.
   - The program should check if the array can be sorted by performing the operations, not just if it is already sorted.

2. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - The program only applies the operation to elements that are greater than 10 and are out of order with the next element. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted.
   - The program should consider all possible ways to apply the operation to elements greater than or equal to 10 to see if the array can be sorted.

3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through the array and applies the operation only once per element, which is not enough to ensure the array can be sorted.
   - The loop should continue applying the operation until no more changes can be made or the array is sorted.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Apply the operation to all elements greater than or equal to 10.
- After applying the operation, check if the array is sorted.
- If the array is not sorted, repeat the process until no more changes can be made or the array is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        new_arr = []
        changed = False
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                new_arr.extend([num // 10, num % 10])
                changed = True
            else:
                new_arr.append(num)
        arr = new_arr
        if not changed:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version will:
- Continuously apply the operation to all elements greater than or equal to 10.
- Check if the array is sorted after each application.
- Stop if no more changes can be made or if the array is sorted.
