### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `list1` itself.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if it is already sorted.
   - If it finds an element that is out of order and greater than 10, it performs the operation of splitting that element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.
   - This function is used to determine if the array is sorted after any operations.

4. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program only checks and performs the operation on the first out-of-order element it finds.
   - This approach is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted by performing the operation any number of times. The program should continue to perform the operation until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - However, it does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - After the first iteration, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` (12 is split into 1 and 2).
  - The array is now sorted, so the program correctly prints `Yes`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - The program only checks the first out-of-order element (12 and 28).
  - It does not consider the possibility of splitting 28 into 2 and 8, which would make the array `[12, 2, 8, 5]`.
  - The array is not sorted, so the program prints `No`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted, so the program correctly prints `Yes`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not continue to perform the operation on all elements that need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only checks and splits the first out-of-order element it finds, which is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
