The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. The state of `num` will be set to the first element of `arr` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple.
- `n` is the first element of the first tuple.
- `x` is the second element of the first tuple.
- `y` is the third element of the first tuple.
- `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is 0.
- `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.

To ensure the loop can execute, `arr` must have at least one element. The variable `num` will be set to the first element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
