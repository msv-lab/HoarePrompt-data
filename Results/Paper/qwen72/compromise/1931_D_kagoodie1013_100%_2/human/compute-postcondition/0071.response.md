Output State: **The program returns the list `results` which contains the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`. The `count` value for each tuple represents the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once for that tuple, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in the `arr` of that tuple.**
