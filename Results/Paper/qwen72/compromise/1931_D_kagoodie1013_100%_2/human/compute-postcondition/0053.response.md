Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value found in the dictionary `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If this key is not present in the dictionary, `0` is used as the default value.
- The values of `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, and `r_y` remain unchanged.
- The specific value by which `count` is incremented depends on the values of `r_x` and `r_y` and whether they form a key in `residue_map`. If they do, `count` is increased by the corresponding value in the dictionary; otherwise, it is increased by `0`.
