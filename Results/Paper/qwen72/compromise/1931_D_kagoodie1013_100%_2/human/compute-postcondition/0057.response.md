Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is now `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r_x` is updated to be the result of `-num % x`.
- The value of `num` remains the second element of `arr`.
- The value of `r_y` remains the result of `num % y`.
- The value of `current_key` is updated to be a tuple containing the new `r_x` and the unchanged `r_y`.
- The value of `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- The value of `residue_map[current_key]` is updated to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`.
- The initial state of `arr` and the conditions for `num`, `r_y`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged.
