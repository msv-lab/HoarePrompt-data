The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, and `num` is the first element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` will be the second element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is now `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`**
