Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`, such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`, such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**
