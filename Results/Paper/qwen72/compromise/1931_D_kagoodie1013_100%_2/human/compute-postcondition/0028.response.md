Output State: **`arr` is a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is equal to `-num % x`.** 

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `-num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `r_x`. The list `arr` and the variable `num` remain unchanged. The value of `r_x` depends on the specific values of `num` and `x`.
