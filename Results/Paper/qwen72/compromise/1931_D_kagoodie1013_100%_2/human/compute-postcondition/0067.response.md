Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is now `-num % x`, `r_y` is now `num % y`, `current_key` is now `(num % x, num % y)`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((num % x, num % y), 0)`, `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is now `residue_map.get((num % x, num % y), 0) + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` updates the value of `residue_map` at the key `current_key` by incrementing it by 1.
- `current_key` is defined as `(num % x, num % y)`, so the key being updated in `residue_map` is `(num % x, num % y)`.
- The previous value of `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` was `residue_map.get((num % x, num % y), 0)`, which means it was either the existing value at that key or 0 if the key did not exist.
- After the update, `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is now `residue_map.get((num % x, num % y), 0) + 1`.
- The values of `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` remain unchanged.
- The value of `count` was previously increased by `residue_map.get((num % x, num % y), 0)`, and this remains valid as the code snippet does not affect `count`.
