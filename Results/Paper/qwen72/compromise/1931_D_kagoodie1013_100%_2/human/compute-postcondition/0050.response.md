The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list with `len(arr)` elements, and `num` is the last element of `arr`. To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` should be the first element of `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
