Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains a list with at least 1 element.
- `num` remains the first element of `arr`.
- `r_x` is still the result of `-num % x`.
- `r_y` is still the result of `num % y`.
- `current_key` is now a tuple containing the values of `r_x` and `r_y`.
- `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, which means it is incremented by the value found in `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)`, or by 0 if that key is not present in `residue_map`.
