The value of `count` is incremented by the value found in `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If the key `(r_x, r_y)` is not present in `residue_map`, `count` is incremented by 0. The values of `r_x` and `r_y` remain `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively, and the list `arr` and the variable `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `r_y` is equal to `num % y`, `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map[(r_x, r_y)]` if the key exists, otherwise `count` is unchanged.**
