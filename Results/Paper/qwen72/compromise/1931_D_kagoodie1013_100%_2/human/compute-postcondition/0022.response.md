Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and has `len(arr)` elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once, `residue_map` contains keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value for each key is the number of times that pair has been encountered, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The `n`, `x`, and `y` values are still the first, second, and third elements of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- The `arr` list is the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and has `len(arr)` elements.
- The `results` list remains empty.
- The `count` variable holds the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered more than once during the loop.
- The `residue_map` dictionary contains keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value for each key is the number of times that specific pair has been encountered.
- The `num` variable is the last element of `arr`.
- The `r_x` variable is the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `r_y` variable is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `current_key` variable is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
