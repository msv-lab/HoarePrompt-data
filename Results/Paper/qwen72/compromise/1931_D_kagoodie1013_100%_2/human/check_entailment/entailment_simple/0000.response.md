Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A beautiful pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is defined such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it into test cases, and then calls `func_1` to compute the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The function `func_1` uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) where:
- \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\)
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\)

For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program:
1. Computes the residues \(r_x\) and \(r_y\).
2. Increments the count by the number of times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been encountered before.
3. Updates the `residue_map` with the current pair \((num \mod x, num \mod y)\).

However, there is a subtle issue with the computation of \(r_x\). The correct computation for \(r_x\) should be:
- \(r_x = (x - num \mod x) \mod x\)

This is because \(-num \mod x\) can result in a negative value, which is not the intended behavior for residue calculations. The correct way to ensure \(r_x\) is non-negative is to use \((x - num \mod x) \mod x\).

Given this, the program is not correctly computing \(r_x\) in all cases, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
