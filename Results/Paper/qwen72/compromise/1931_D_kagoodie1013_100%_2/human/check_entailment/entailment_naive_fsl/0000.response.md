Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`, and efficiently counts the pairs that meet the criteria of being beautiful. The program processes the input correctly, handles multiple test cases, and outputs the correct number of beautiful pairs for each test case. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
