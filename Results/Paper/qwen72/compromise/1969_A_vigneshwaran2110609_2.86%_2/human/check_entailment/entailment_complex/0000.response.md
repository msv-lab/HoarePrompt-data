### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x` which represents the number of friends.
   - It then reads a list `l` of `x` integers, where each integer `l[i]` represents the best friend of the `i`-th friend.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The function iterates over the list `l` and checks if there is any index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`.
   - This condition checks if the best friend of the `i`-th friend is also the best friend of the `l[i]`-th friend, forming a mutual best friend pair.

3. **Output**:
   - If the condition is met for any index, the function prints `2` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that Monocarp can send invitations to at least 2 friends to ensure they both come.
   - If the condition is never met, the function prints `3`, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come.

### Issues:
- **Test Case Handling**: The function reads `n` as the number of test cases but does not handle the test cases correctly. It should read `t` as the number of test cases and use `t` in the outer loop.
- **Variable Naming**: The variable `n` in the outer loop is used to store the number of test cases, but it should be `t` to match the problem description.
- **Loop Variable Overwriting**: The inner loop uses the same variable `i` as the outer loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior. It is better to use a different variable for the inner loop.
- **Mutual Best Friend Pair**: The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is incorrect. It should be `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` to correctly check if the best friend of the `i`-th friend is also the best friend of the `l[i]`-th friend.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):  # Iterate over each test case
        x = int(input())  # Number of friends
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))  # List of best friends
        
        flag = False
        for i in range(x):  # Iterate over each friend
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:  # Check if the best friend of the i-th friend is also the best friend of the l[i]-th friend
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program correctly handles the test cases and checks the mutual best friend condition. It prints `2` if there is a mutual best friend pair and `3` otherwise, which matches the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.)
