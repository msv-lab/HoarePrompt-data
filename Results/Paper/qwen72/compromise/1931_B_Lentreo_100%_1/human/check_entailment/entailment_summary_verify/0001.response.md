### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the amounts of water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour any amount of water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container after the operations will be the mean of the initial amounts, which is `mean = total // n`.
   - The operations can only move water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean of the amounts of water.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` between the current amount of water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the containers with lower indices to balance the containers with higher indices, and thus, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in the containers `nums`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with `nums` as the argument.
   - In `func_1`:
     - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, the problem guarantees that the sum is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
     - It calculates the mean amount of water.
     - It initializes a variable `curr` to track the cumulative difference.
     - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current amount of water and the mean.
     - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it returns 'NO' because it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
     - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the key idea of tracking the cumulative difference.
   - The function will return 'NO' if at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, which is the correct behavior.
   - The function will return 'YES' if the cumulative difference never becomes negative, which is also correct.
   - The redundant check for divisibility by `n` does not affect the correctness of the program, as the problem guarantees that the sum is always divisible by `n`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by only pouring from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

Final: **True**
