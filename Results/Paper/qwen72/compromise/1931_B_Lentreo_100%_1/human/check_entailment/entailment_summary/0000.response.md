Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if it is possible to equalize the water levels in all containers by pouring water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks this by calculating the mean water level and then iterating through the list to ensure that the cumulative deviation from the mean does not become negative. If it does, it means that at some point, it would be impossible to balance the water levels without violating the condition that water can only be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one.

However, there is a subtle issue in the problem statement and the function's implementation:
- The problem states that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, and the function checks this condition. This check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`.
- The function correctly calculates the mean and checks the cumulative deviation from the mean. If the cumulative deviation becomes negative, it means that the water in the containers cannot be balanced using the allowed operations.

Given the execution summary, the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
