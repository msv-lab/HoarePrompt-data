Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**. This indicates that the condition where the sum of the integers in the list `nums` is divisible by the length of the list `n` is not met, despite the initial state suggesting it should be. However, the code snippet directly returns 'NO' without performing any calculations or checks, so the output is 'NO' regardless of the initial state.
