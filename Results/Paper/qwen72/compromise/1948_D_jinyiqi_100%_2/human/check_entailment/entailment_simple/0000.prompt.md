Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as an argument, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), which is not shown in the function definition provided.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `k` is `n - 2`. If the loop has found a sequence of `j` consecutive pairs of characters where each pair either contains a question mark or the characters in the pair are equal, then `count` is `j` and the program has printed `j * 2` and returned. Otherwise, `count` is less than `j` and the program has not printed anything or returned.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: - The `print(0)` statement will print the integer 0.
