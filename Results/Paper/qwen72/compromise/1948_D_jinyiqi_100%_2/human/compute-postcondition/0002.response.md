The only objects in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and the range parameters. The loop will execute if `n // 2` is greater than 0. This means that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to have a valid range to iterate over.

- `j` will start at `n // 2` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 1.
- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2, and `j` starts at `n // 2`.

State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is `n // 2`**
