Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 3; `j` is `n // 2`; `k` is 1. If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the same conditions on `s`, `n`, `j`, `k`, and `count`.***
