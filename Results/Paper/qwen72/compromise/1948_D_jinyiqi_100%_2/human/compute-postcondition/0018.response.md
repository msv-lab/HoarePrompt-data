Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine the value of `count` and what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a list of characters from an input string, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - The length of the input string (and thus the list `s`) is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 3.
   - `j` is `n // 2`, which means `j` is the integer division of `n` by 2.
   - `k` is 1.

2. **Conditions for `count`:**
   - If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

3. **Determine the value of `count`:**
   - `k` is 1.
   - `j` is `n // 2`.
   - We need to check the conditions for `s[1]` and `s[1 + j]`.

   Let's consider the possible scenarios:
   - If `s[1]` is a question mark, `count` is 2.
   - If `s[1 + j]` is a question mark, `count` is 2.
   - If `s[1]` is equal to `s[1 + j]`, `count` is 2.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, `count` is 0.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.

Given the conditions, `count` can only be 0 or 2. Since `count` is not equal to `j`, and `j` is at least 1 (because `n` is at least 3), `count` cannot be `j`.

Therefore, the possible values for `count` are:
- 0: If `s[1]` is not a question mark, `s[1 + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[1]` is not equal to `s[1 + j]`.
- 2: If any of the conditions for `s[1]` or `s[1 + j]` are met.

The print statement `print(count * 2)` will print:
- `0 * 2 = 0` if `count` is 0.
- `2 * 2 = 4` if `count` is 2.

Since the exact values of `s[1]` and `s[1 + j]` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **0 or 4 (where 0 is printed if `s[1]` is not a question mark, `s[1 + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[1]` is not equal to `s[1 + j]`; and 4 is printed if any of the conditions for `s[1]` or `s[1 + j]` are met)**
