The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where `1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18`. It then prints a result based on the following conditions for each test case:
- If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it prints `2`.
- If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, it prints `2 + m // b`.
- If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, it prints `2 + m // a`.
- If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.

After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the results for each test case have been printed to the console.
