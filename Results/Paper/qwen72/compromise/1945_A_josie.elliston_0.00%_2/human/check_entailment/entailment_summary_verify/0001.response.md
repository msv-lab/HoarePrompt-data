### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None` because it's impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts and universals.
   - If the above condition is satisfied, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts, the number of tents needed is exactly the number of introverts.
   - **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts, the number of tents needed is `ceil(extroverts / 3)`.
   - **All Universals:** If there are only universals, the number of tents needed is `ceil(universals / 3)`.
   - **Mixed Cases:** The function should handle cases where there are a mix of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 2 (2 extroverts + 1 universal in 1 tent, 2 universals in 1 tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 2:** `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts + 1 universal in 1 tent, but 1 universal is not enough to form a tent with 4 extroverts)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 3:** `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts + 2 universals in 2 tents)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 4:** `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 1 (1 extrovert + 1 universal in 1 tent, but 1 universal is not enough to form a tent with 1 extrovert)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 5:** `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 3 (3 extroverts in 1 tent, 2 universals in 1 tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 6:** `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 (19 tents)
     - Extroverts: 7 (7 extroverts + 18 universals in 7 tents, 11 universals in 4 tents)
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28
   - **Test Case 7:** `0 0 0`
     - No participants, so no tents are needed.
     - Total tents: 0
   - **Test Case 8:** `7 0 0`
     - Introverts: 7 (7 tents)
     - No extroverts or universals.
     - Total tents: 7
   - **Test Case 9:** `0 24 0`
     - No introverts or universals.
     - Extroverts: 24 (24 / 3 = 8 tents)
     - Total tents: 8
   - **Test Case 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 tents)
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 / 3 = 333333333.33, rounded up to 333333334 tents)
     - Universals: 1000000000 (1000000000 / 3 = 333333333.33, rounded up to 333333334 tents)
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts and universals) = 1333333334

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function correctly checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3.
  - If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts plus the number of universals is at least 3.
  - If the above condition is satisfied, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3.
  - This logic is correct for the given problem constraints.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function correctly handles the case where `func_1` returns `None` by returning -1.
  - It correctly adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` when `func_1` returns a valid number of tents.
  - This logic is also correct for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases. It ensures that the number of tents is minimized while respecting the preferences of introverts, extroverts, and universals. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
