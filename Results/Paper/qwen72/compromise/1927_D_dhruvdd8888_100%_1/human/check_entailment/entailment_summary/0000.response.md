Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the `func_1` function.
   - Within `func_1`, the program reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Array Processing**:
   - The program appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases where the last segment of identical numbers extends to the end of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to identify segments of consecutive identical numbers and stores these segments in the `arr` list. Each segment is represented as a tuple `(start, end, value)`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` of the first segment that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if a valid pair of indices exists within the range `[l, r]`:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l` and the segment does not extend beyond `r`, it prints the indices of the segment boundaries.
     - If the segment starts at `l` and extends beyond `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)` because no valid pair exists.
     - If the segment starts before `l` and ends before `r`, it prints the indices of the segment boundaries.
     - If no valid segment is found, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the last segment of identical numbers extends to the end of the array by appending `-1` to `nums`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where no valid pair of indices exists within the query range.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the required indices or `(-1, -1)` for each query, as specified in the problem description.

However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Use of `min(eli, LA)`**:
  - The use of `min(eli, LA)` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. If `eli` is greater than `LA`, it means the segment does not exist within the range, and the program should handle this case appropriately.
  
- **Incorrect Conditions**:
  - The conditions for checking if a valid pair exists are not correctly formulated. Specifically, the conditions for checking if the segment starts at `l` and extends beyond `r` or if the segment starts before `l` and ends before `r` are not clear and can lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands. The logic for determining the valid pairs of indices needs to be revised to ensure it correctly handles all query cases.

Correctness: **False**
