Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Function Call and Definition Mismatch**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop for each test case, but it is defined after the loop. This is not a syntax error, but it is unconventional and can be confusing.
   - The function `func_1()` should be defined before it is called.

2. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**:
   - The `bisect_left` function is used to find the leftmost position where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - However, the `arr` list is not sorted in a way that `bisect_left` can be used effectively. The `arr` list contains tuples of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, but the `bisect_left` function is being called with a tuple `(l, 0, 0)`, which does not match the structure of the elements in `arr`.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Query Handling**:
   - The logic for handling the queries is flawed. The program attempts to find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` within the range `[l, r]` by using the `arr` list, but the conditions and the way it checks for the existence of such a pair are incorrect.
   - For example, the condition `if s > l` is not sufficient to determine if there are different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For instance, if the array `nums` contains all the same elements, the program might not correctly identify that no different pair exists within the query range.

5. **Appending `-1` to `nums`**:
   - The program appends `-1` to the `nums` list to handle the end of the array. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results if the array already contains `-1`.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach to solve this problem would involve:

1. **Preprocessing the Array**:
   - Preprocess the array to identify the first and last occurrence of each unique value in the array. This can be done using a dictionary or a list of lists.

2. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, check if there are at least two different elements in the range `[l, r]` using the preprocessed information.
   - If such a pair exists, output the indices. If not, output `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Preprocess the array to store the first and last occurrence of each value
    first_occurrence = defaultdict(int)
    last_occurrence = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        if nums[i] not in first_occurrence:
            first_occurrence[nums[i]] = i + 1
        last_occurrence[nums[i]] = i + 1
    
    # Process each query
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        found = False
        for value, first in first_occurrence.items():
            last = last_occurrence[value]
            if first < l and last >= r:
                print(first, last)
                found = True
                break
            if first >= l and first <= r and last >= l and last <= r and first != last:
                print(first, last)
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            print(-1, -1)

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version preprocesses the array to store the first and last occurrence of each value, and then efficiently handles each query by checking if there are at least two different elements in the given range.
