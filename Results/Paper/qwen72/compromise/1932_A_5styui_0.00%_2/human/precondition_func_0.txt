The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters. The string consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters, representing empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns, respectively. It is guaranteed that the first cell of each path is empty.
