Output State: **`s` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2.**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so if `s` was initially 0, it is now 1. If `s` was initially 1, it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
