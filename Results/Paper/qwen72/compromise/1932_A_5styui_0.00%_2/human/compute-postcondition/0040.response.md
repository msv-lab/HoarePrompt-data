Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000), `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string, and `j` is the last index of `b` (i.e., `len(b) - 1`).**

The value of `b` is now a new input string, and `j` is updated to be the last index of this new string `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
