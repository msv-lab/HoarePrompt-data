To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **`s`**: This variable is defined as the number of '@' characters in the string `b`.
2. **`t`**: This is an input integer with a range of 1 to 1000. However, `t` is not used in the `print` statement.
3. **`a`**: This is a variable that is greater than 2. It is not used in the `print` statement.
4. **`i`**: This is a variable set to 2. It is not used in the `print` statement.
5. **`d`**: This is a new input integer. It is not used in the `print` statement.
6. **`b`**: This is a new input string. The value of `s` depends on the number of '@' characters in this string.
7. **`j`**: This is the last index of the string `b`, which is `len(b) - 1`. It is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the number of '@' characters in the string `b`.

Since the exact value of `b` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe `s` based on the given information.

Output: **s (where s is the number of '@' characters in the string b)**
