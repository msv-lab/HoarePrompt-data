Let's break down the provided Python code snippet step by step to understand what it will print based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Each of the four integers \(p_i\) in the test cases is an integer such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - The code starts by reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - This is done using `int(input())`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the code reads a line of input containing four integers \(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3\).
   - These integers are read using `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input line into four parts and converts each part to an integer.

3. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - For each integer \(x\) in the list of four integers, the code calculates the expression:
     \[
     3 \times \left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + (x \mod 2) \times (i < 3)
     \]
   - Here, `x // 2` is the integer division of \(x\) by 2.
   - `x % 2` is the remainder when \(x\) is divided by 2.
   - `(i < 3)` is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if \(i\) is less than 3, and 0 otherwise.

4. **Summing the Results:**
   - The results of the above expression for each integer \(x\) are summed up.
   - This sum is then divided by 3 using integer division (`// 3`).

5. **Converting to String and Joining:**
   - The result of the division is converted to a string.
   - This string is added to a list of results for each test case.
   - The list of results is joined into a single string with each result separated by a newline (`\n`).

### Final Output:
- The code will print the results of the above calculations for each test case, each on a new line.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `t = 2` (two test cases).
- For the first test case, the input is `10 11 12 13`.
  - \(p_0 = 10\), \(p_1 = 11\), \(p_2 = 12\), \(p_3 = 13\).
  - The calculation for each \(p_i\):
    - \(p_0\): \(3 \times (10 // 2) + (10 \mod 2) \times (0 < 3) = 3 \times 5 + 0 \times 1 = 15\)
    - \(p_1\): \(3 \times (11 // 2) + (11 \mod 2) \times (1 < 3) = 3 \times 5 + 1 \times 1 = 16\)
    - \(p_2\): \(3 \times (12 // 2) + (12 \mod 2) \times (2 < 3) = 3 \times 6 + 0 \times 1 = 18\)
    - \(p_3\): \(3 \times (13 // 2) + (13 \mod 2) \times (3 < 3) = 3 \times 6 + 1 \times 0 = 18\)
  - Sum: \(15 + 16 + 18 + 18 = 67\)
  - Result: \(67 // 3 = 22\)
- For the second test case, the input is `5 6 7 8`.
  - \(p_0 = 5\), \(p_1 = 6\), \(p_2 = 7\), \(p_3 = 8\).
  - The calculation for each \(p_i\):
    - \(p_0\): \(3 \times (5 // 2) + (5 \mod 2) \times (0 < 3) = 3 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 = 7\)
    - \(p_1\): \(3 \times (6 // 2) + (6 \mod 2) \times (1 < 3) = 3 \times 3 + 0 \times 1 = 9\)
    - \(p_2\): \(3 \times (7 // 2) + (7 \mod 2) \times (2 < 3) = 3 \times 3 + 1 \times 1 = 10\)
    - \(p_3\): \(3 \times (8 // 2) + (8 \mod 2) \times (3 < 3) = 3 \times 4 + 0 \times 0 = 12\)
  - Sum: \(7 + 9 + 10 + 12 = 38\)
  - Result: \(38 // 3 = 12\)

### Final Output:
- The code will print the results of the above calculations for each test case, each on a new line.

Output: **22
12** (where each line represents the result of the calculation for each test case)
