Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the largest integers `i` such that \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from the initial `x - 1` without making `x` negative, and `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`x` is 0**: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not zero. Each iteration subtracts \(2^i - 1\) from `x`, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq x + 1\). Eventually, `x` will be reduced to 0, and the loop will terminate.
- **`subseq_lens` is a list containing the largest integers `i` such that \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from the initial `x - 1` without making `x` negative**: During each iteration, the value of `i` is appended to `subseq_lens` if \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from `x` without making `x` negative. This list will contain the sequence of the largest integers `i` found in each iteration.
- **`mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution**: The variable `mx` is updated to the maximum value of `i` found in each iteration. By the end of the loop, `mx` will hold the largest integer `i` that was ever appended to `subseq_lens`.
