Reasoning:

1. **Objective**: The objective is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation involves either setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum sum as follows:
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is 1.
   - For \( n > 1 \), the sum is calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \).

   Let's break down the formula:
   - \( i^2 - (i-1)^2 = 2i - 1 \).
   - Therefore, the formula becomes \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i \).
   - Simplifying further, \( (2i - 1) \times i = 2i^2 - i \).
   - The sum is then \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \).

   This formula correctly calculates the maximum possible sum for the matrix. The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and the sum of the squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \). Using these, the sum can be verified to be correct.

3. **Operations**:
   - The program prints \( 2n \) operations for each test case.
   - For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs:
     - A Type 1 operation on row \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - A Type 2 operation on column \( n - j + 1 \) with the same permutation.

   These operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \). This is a valid and efficient way to maximize the sum of the matrix, as each element in the matrix will be one of the integers from 1 to \( n \), and each integer will appear exactly \( n \) times in the matrix.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It also prints the operations in the required format, ensuring that the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of both the sum calculation and the operations performed.

Correctness: **True**
