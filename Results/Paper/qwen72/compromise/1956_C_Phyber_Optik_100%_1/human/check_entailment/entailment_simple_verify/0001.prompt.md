You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        
        print(sum, n + n)
        
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, the variable `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500. The loop prints the value of `sum` and `2 * n` for each test case, followed by two lines of output for each `j` from 1 to `n`, each line containing `1` or `2`, `n - j + 1`, and a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `sum` for each test case is calculated as the sum of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`, and then printed along with `2 * n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix.
   - We can perform two types of operations: Type 1 (assign a permutation to a row) and Type 2 (assign a permutation to a column).
   - The maximum possible sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) repeated \( n \) times.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum using the formula \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \).
   - It prints the calculated sum and \( 2n \) (the number of operations).
   - It then performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation in the program is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i
     \]
   - Simplifying the term inside the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
     \]
   - Expanding the sum:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This can be further simplified:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - The sum of squares from 2 to \( n \) is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 - 1^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1
     \]
   - The sum of integers from 2 to \( n \) is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i - 1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Substituting these back:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 3n(n+1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n + 2 - 3)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n - 1)}{6}
     \]
   - This is not the correct formula for the maximum sum, which should be:
     \[
     \text{sum} = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]

4. **Operations:**
   - The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This ensures that each row and each column will contain the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is the correct approach to maximize the sum.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect.
   - However, the operations performed are correct and will indeed maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because the sum calculation is wrong. The correct sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), not the sum calculated by the provided formula. Despite this, the operations performed are correct and will maximize the sum of the matrix.
