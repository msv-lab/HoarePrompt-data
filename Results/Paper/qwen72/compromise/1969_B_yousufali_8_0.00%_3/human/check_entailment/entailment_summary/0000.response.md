### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function reads a binary string from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and calculates a cost based on the number of '1's and the positions of '0's in the string.
     - The cost is calculated by summing `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1', where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far.
     - The function then prints the calculated cost.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, processing each test case individually.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**:
     - `func_2` correctly handles the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
     - The cost calculation in `func_1` is based on the number of '1's and the positions of '0's. However, this approach does not correctly implement the cyclic shift cost calculation.
     - The problem requires us to consider the minimum cost to make the string sorted, which involves finding the optimal substrings to cyclically shift.
     - The current implementation in `func_1` does not account for the optimal substrings and their lengths, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `10`, the correct output is `2` (cyclic shift the whole string).
   - For the input `0000`, the correct output is `0` (the string is already sorted).
   - For the input `11000`, the correct output is `9` (as described in the problem statement).
   - For the input `101011`, the correct output is `5` (as described in the problem statement).
   - For the input `01101001`, the correct output is `11` (as described in the problem statement).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
   - The function `func_1` should instead find the optimal substrings to shift and calculate the total cost based on the lengths of these substrings.

### Correctness: **False**
