You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, but it reads a binary string from input, converts it into a list of integers, and calculates the cost to sort the string. The input string should consist only of '0's and '1's and should have a length of at least 2.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `n` is the number of '1's in the input string, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1' in the input string, and `n` is the number of '1's in the input string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a binary string from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and calculates a cost based on the number of '1's and the positions of '0's in the string. It prints the calculated cost, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1', where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: No variables are passed to the function func_2, `t` is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` holds the integer value that was input by the user, and `func_1` has been called `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the input and output requirements as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` reads the string `s` as a list of integers using `input().split()`, which is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. Additionally, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the string is already sorted, and it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```

The expected output is:
```
2
0
9
5
11
```

However, the program will fail to produce the correct output because it incorrectly parses the input and does not implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the string. The function `func_1` should instead read the input as a string and correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the string.
