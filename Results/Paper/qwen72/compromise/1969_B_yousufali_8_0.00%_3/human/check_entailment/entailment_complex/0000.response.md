Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, `func_2` calls `func_1`.

2. **String Conversion**:
   - `func_1` reads a binary string and converts it into a list of integers. However, the input is read using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for this problem. The input should be read as a single string without splitting, as the binary string does not contain spaces.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost to sort the binary string by counting the number of '1's (`n`) and adding `n + 1` to the cost (`ans`) for each '0' that follows at least one '1'.
   - This logic is based on the idea that each '0' that follows a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '1' to the left of the '0', and the cost of such a shift is the length of the substring being shifted, which is `n + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the calculated cost for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost should be 0, which the function correctly handles.
   - If the string has a mix of '0's and '1's, the function calculates the cost based on the number of '1's and the positions of '0's, which aligns with the problem description.

However, the input handling in `func_1` is incorrect. The binary string should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers. The current implementation splits the input, which will not work correctly for a single binary string without spaces.

Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))  # Corrected to read the string as a single input and convert to list of integers
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    print(ans)
```

Given the incorrect input handling in the original `func_1`, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
