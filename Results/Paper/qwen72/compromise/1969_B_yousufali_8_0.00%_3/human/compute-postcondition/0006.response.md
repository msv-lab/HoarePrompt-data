The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a binary string from the input, which should consist only of '0's and '1's and have a length of at least 2. The function then converts this binary string into a list of integers and calculates the cost to sort the string. The function returns the calculated cost.

Functionality: **The function reads a binary string from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and returns the cost to sort the string.**
