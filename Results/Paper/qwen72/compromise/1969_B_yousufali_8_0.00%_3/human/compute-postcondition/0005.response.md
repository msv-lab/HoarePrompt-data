To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is the number of '1's in the input string.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1'.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - For each '0' in the input string that comes after at least one '1', we add `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - `n` is the count of '1's in the entire string.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose the input string is `"11010010"`.
   - `n` is the number of '1's in the string, which is 4.
   - We need to find each '0' that follows at least one '1' and add `n + 1` (which is 5) to `ans` for each such '0'.
   - The positions of '0's that follow at least one '1' are at indices 2, 4, 5, and 7.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be calculated as: \( 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 \).

4. **General Case**:
   - If the input string has `m` '0's that follow at least one '1', and `n` is the number of '1's in the string, then `ans` will be \( m \times (n + 1) \).

5. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1'.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1' in the input string, and `n` is the number of '1's in the input string)**
