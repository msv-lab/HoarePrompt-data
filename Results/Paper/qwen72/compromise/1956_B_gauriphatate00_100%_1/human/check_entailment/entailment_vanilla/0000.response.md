### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player (you and Nene) gets n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize your score, you should try to play cards that have a duplicate in your hand as early as possible. This way, when you play the second card with the same number, you will score a point.
   - Nene, being optimal, will try to play cards that do not have duplicates in your hand first, to minimize your chances of scoring points.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, n)` to compute the maximum score you can get.
   - The function `func_1`:
     - Initializes a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
     - Iterates through the integers from 1 to n.
     - For each integer, if it appears exactly twice in your hand, you can score 1 point by playing both cards.
     - The function returns the total score.

4. **Correctness of the Strategy:**
   - The function correctly identifies the integers that appear twice in your hand.
   - However, it does not consider the optimal strategy of Nene. The function assumes that you can always play both cards of the same integer and score a point, which is not always true if Nene plays optimally.

5. **Optimal Play Consideration:**
   - If you have two cards of the same integer, Nene can play the matching card from her hand before you play the second card, thus preventing you from scoring a point.
   - Therefore, the function should account for the fact that Nene will play optimally to minimize your score.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To get the correct maximum score, you should only count the integers that appear exactly once in your hand. If an integer appears twice, Nene will play the matching card before you can score a point with the second card.
   - The correct maximum score is the number of unique integers in your hand.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not account for Nene's optimal play, which means it may overestimate your score.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
