Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the integer `n` and the list `a` of integers. This matches the problem description.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function `func_1` creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. This is a correct approach to determine how many times each integer appears in your hand.

3. **Calculating Maximum Score**: The function then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer appears exactly twice in your hand (i.e., `count_a[num] == 2`). If it does, it increments the `max_score` by 1. This logic is based on the idea that if you have both cards of a particular integer, you can score a point for that integer by playing the second card after Nene has played the first card.

4. **Optimal Play**: The problem states that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the function `func_1` only considers the maximum number of points you can score, assuming you play optimally. The function does not explicitly model Nene's optimal play, but it correctly calculates the maximum points you can score under the assumption that Nene will play optimally.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for each test case after processing all of them.

Given the problem constraints and the optimal play assumption, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score. Nene's optimal play is implicitly considered because if you have both cards of a particular integer, you can always score a point for that integer, regardless of how Nene plays.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
