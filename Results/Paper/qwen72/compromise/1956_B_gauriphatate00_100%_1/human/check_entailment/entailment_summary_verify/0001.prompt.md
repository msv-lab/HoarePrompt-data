You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(a, n)
    results.append(result)
for res in results:
    print(res)

def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
    max_score = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                max_score += 1
    return max_score



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns the count of integers in the range from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player (you and Nene) gets n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize your score, you should try to play cards that have a duplicate in your hand as early as possible. This way, when you play the second card with the same number, you will score a point.
   - Nene, being optimal, will try to play cards that do not have duplicates in your hand first, to minimize your chances of scoring points.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, n)` to compute the maximum score you can get.
   - The function `func_1`:
     - Initializes a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
     - Iterates through the integers from 1 to n.
     - For each integer, if it appears exactly twice in your hand, you can score 1 point by playing both cards.
     - The function returns the total score.

4. **Correctness of the Strategy:**
   - The function correctly identifies the integers that appear twice in your hand.
   - However, it does not consider the optimal strategy of Nene. The function assumes that you can always play both cards of the same integer and score a point, which is not always true if Nene plays optimally.

5. **Optimal Play Consideration:**
   - If you have two cards of the same integer, Nene can play the matching card from her hand before you play the second card, thus preventing you from scoring a point.
   - Therefore, the function should account for the fact that Nene will play optimally to minimize your score.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To get the correct maximum score, you should only count the integers that appear exactly once in your hand. If an integer appears twice, Nene will play the matching card before you can score a point with the second card.
   - The correct maximum score is the number of unique integers in your hand.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not account for Nene's optimal play, which means it may overestimate your score.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
