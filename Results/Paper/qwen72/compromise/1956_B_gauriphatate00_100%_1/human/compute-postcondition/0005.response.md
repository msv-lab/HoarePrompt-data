To determine the output state, let's break down the loop and its effects on the variables:

1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
2. For each number `num` in this range, it checks if `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a`.
3. If `num` is in `count_a` and its value is 2, it increments `max_score` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.
- `max_score` is 0.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.

The loop will count how many integers in the range from 1 to `n` appear exactly twice in the list `a`.

Output State: **`max_score` is the number of integers in the range from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged.**
