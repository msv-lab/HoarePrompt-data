Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input as specified. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. The program then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears more frequently. If the counts are equal, it prints 'B', which is consistent with the problem's requirement to print the character that appears most frequently.

The program also handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `t` is within the specified range and that each string is of length 5. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is as expected, with the correct output for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
