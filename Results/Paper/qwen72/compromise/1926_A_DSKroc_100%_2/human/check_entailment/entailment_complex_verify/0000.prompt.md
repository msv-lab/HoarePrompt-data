You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed, `q` is equal to `t - 1`, `s` is the last input string, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the number of 'A' characters in the last input string is greater than the number of non-'A' characters. Otherwise, the number of 'A' characters in the last input string is less than or equal to the number of non-'A' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine which character, 'A' or 'B', appears more frequently in each string of length 5. It reads the number of test cases, iterates through each test case, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, and prints the character that appears more frequently. The program handles all specified constraints and edge cases, such as strings with equal counts of 'A' and 'B', and strings composed entirely of one character. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
