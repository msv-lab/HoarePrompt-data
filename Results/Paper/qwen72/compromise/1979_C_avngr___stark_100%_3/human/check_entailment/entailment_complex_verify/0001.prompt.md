You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of a and b, divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). After the function concludes, the input variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer that represents the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, and the list is non-empty.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the initial length of the list, `result` is the final result after applying `func_1` to all elements of `numbers` in sequence.
    return result
    #The program returns the final result after applying `func_1` to all elements of the list `numbers` in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of sequentially applying the function `func_1` to all elements in the list. The input list `numbers` remains unchanged after the function execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th winning outcome is `x_i * k_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome and `k_i` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - We need to ensure that for all `i`, `sum(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) < x_i * k_i`.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The multipliers `k_i` are integers between 2 and 20.
   - The number of outcomes `n` is between 1 and 50.
   - The number of test cases `t` can be up to 10^4.

3. **Solution Strategy**:
   - To ensure that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - The LCM of the multipliers will give us a number that, when divided by each `k_i`, gives a common base for the bets.
   - We can then distribute the bets such that the total sum of bets is just less than the LCM, ensuring that the return for any winning outcome is greater than the total bet.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - **func_2(numbers)**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the LCM of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - If the LCM is less than or equal to the sum of the multipliers, it is impossible to distribute the coins as required, and we return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, we can distribute the coins such that each bet `x_i` is equal to `LCM // k_i`. This ensures that the total sum of bets is less than the LCM, and the return for any winning outcome is greater than the total bet.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same, the LCM will be that number, and the total sum of bets will be `n * (LCM // k_i)`. If `n * (LCM // k_i) >= LCM`, it is impossible to satisfy the condition, and we return `-1`.
   - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be larger, and we can always find a distribution that satisfies the condition.

7. **Code Implementation**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The main logic to distribute the coins and check the condition is missing, but the functions are correct.

Given the above reasoning, the provided functions are correct, but the main logic to solve the problem is not included. Therefore, the program as a whole is incomplete and incorrect.
