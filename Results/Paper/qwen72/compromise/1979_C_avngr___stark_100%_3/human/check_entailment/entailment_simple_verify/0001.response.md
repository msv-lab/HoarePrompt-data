Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th winning outcome is `x_i * k_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome and `k_i` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - We need to ensure that for all `i`, `sum(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) < x_i * k_i`.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The multipliers `k_i` are integers between 2 and 20.
   - The number of outcomes `n` is between 1 and 50.
   - The number of test cases `t` can be up to 10^4.

3. **Solution Strategy**:
   - The solution uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to find a common base for the bets.
   - The LCM of the multipliers will give us a number `m` such that when divided by each `k_i`, the result is a common base for the bets.
   - We can then distribute the bets such that each bet `x_i` is equal to `m // k_i`.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - **func_2(numbers)**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the LCM of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - If the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is greater than or equal to the LCM `m`, it is impossible to distribute the coins as required, and we return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, we can distribute the coins such that each bet `x_i` is equal to `m // k_i`. This ensures that the total sum of bets is less than the LCM, and the return for any winning outcome is greater than the total bet.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same, the LCM will be that number, and the total sum of bets will be `n * (LCM // k_i)`. If `n * (LCM // k_i) >= LCM`, it is impossible to satisfy the condition, and we return `-1`.
   - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be larger, and we can always find a distribution that satisfies the condition.

7. **Code Implementation**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The main logic to distribute the coins and check the condition is implemented correctly. The program calculates the LCM, distributes the bets, and checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If not, it prints `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
