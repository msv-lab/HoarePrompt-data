### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.

2. **Key Constraints:**
   - `1 \le t \le 10^4` (number of test cases)
   - `1 \le n \le 50` (number of outcomes)
   - `2 \le k_i \le 20` (multipliers for each outcome)
   - `1 \le x_i \le 10^9` (bets on each outcome)

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`:**
     - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
     - The LCM is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a multiple of the LCM of all multipliers `k_i`.

   - **Function `func_2(numbers)`:**
     - This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers `numbers`.
     - It iterates through the list and applies `func_1` to each pair of elements, effectively calculating the LCM of the entire list.

   - **Main Loop:**
     - For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
     - It calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
     - It then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome as `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
     - If the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints `-1` (indicating no valid distribution).
     - Otherwise, it prints the bets `c`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a multiple of the LCM.
     - This is a valid approach because the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers, ensuring that the bets can be distributed in a way that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

   - **Betting Strategy:**
     - The bets are calculated as `m // k[i]`, which ensures that the amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * (m // k_i) = m`.
     - The total amount bet is `sum(c) = sum(m // k[i])`.
     - The condition `sum(c) < m` must hold for the solution to be valid.

   - **Edge Cases:**
     - If all multipliers `k_i` are the same, the sum of the bets `sum(c)` will be `n * (m // k_i)`, which is equal to `m` if `n == k_i`. This is why the program correctly prints `-1` for such cases.
     - For other cases, the program ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is strictly less than `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the bets for each outcome and checks if the total bet is less than the LCM of the multipliers. It handles edge cases where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.

**Correctness: **True****
