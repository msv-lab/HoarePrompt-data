Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `result` is the new result of `func_1(result, num)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `result` is updated to the result of the function `func_1` when called with the current value of `result` and the third element of `numbers` (`num`).
- The list `numbers` and the variable `num` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only state that `result` has been updated to the new result of this function call.
