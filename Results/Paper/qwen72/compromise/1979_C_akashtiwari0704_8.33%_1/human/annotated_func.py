#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes. k_1, k_2, ..., k_n are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. The variable `T` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `bets` was an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` was a list of integers read from the user's input, and each element `a[i]` was updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. The variable `prod` was the product of all elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` for each iteration. The variable `i` was `bets - 1` at the end of each iteration, and `sumo` was the sum of the updated elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`. If `sumo` was greater than or equal to `prod` for any iteration, `-1` was printed. Otherwise, a string `ans` containing all elements of the updated `a` list separated by spaces was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of outcomes and their respective multipliers. For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers and then updates each multiplier to the product divided by the original multiplier. It sums these updated multipliers and checks if the sum is less than the product. If so, it prints the updated multipliers as a space-separated string; otherwise, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables `t` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` unchanged, but the internal variables used in the function (like `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans`) are no longer accessible.
