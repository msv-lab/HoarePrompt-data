Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1` (or `T + 2` relative to the initial state before the last iteration), `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers where each element `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` from the first to the `bets`-th element, each followed by a space. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of the updated `a` list separated by spaces.***
