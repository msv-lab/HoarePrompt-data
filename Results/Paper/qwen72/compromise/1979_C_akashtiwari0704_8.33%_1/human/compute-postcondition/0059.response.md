Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\).
   - `T` is `T + 1` (though `T` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned).
   - `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input.
   - `prod` is the product of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` after they have been updated to `prod // a[i]`.
   - `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]` if `sumo` is less than `prod`.
   - The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the print statement directly because the print statement is hardcoded to print `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
