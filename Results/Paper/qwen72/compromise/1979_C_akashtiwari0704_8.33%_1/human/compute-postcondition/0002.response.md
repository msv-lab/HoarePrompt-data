Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user.** 

The code snippet `bets = int(input())` reads an integer from the user and assigns it to the variable `bets`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
