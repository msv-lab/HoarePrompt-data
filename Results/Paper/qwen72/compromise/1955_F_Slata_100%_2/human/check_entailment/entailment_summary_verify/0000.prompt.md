You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each of the `t` iterations, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input, where `0 <= a, b, c, d <= 200`. It then calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of these integers are odd. The function does not return any value, and the values of `t` and the input integers remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed. The program attempts to calculate the number of wins by dividing the counts of each number by 2 and adding a condition based on the sum of the remainders. However, this approach does not consider the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 0 0 0
```
The sequence contains only two 1s. The XOR of two 1s is 0, so Bob wins. However, the program will output:
```
1
```
This is incorrect because Bob should win only once, not zero times. The correct output should be 1, as removing one 1 will make the XOR non-zero, and removing both will make the XOR zero again.

Another example where the program fails is:
```
1
0 2 0 0
```
The sequence contains only two 2s. The XOR of two 2s is 0, so Bob wins. The program will output:
```
1
```
This is correct for this specific case, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all cases.

A more robust approach would involve considering the properties of XOR and the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers in a way that maximizes Bob's wins. The current program does not do this correctly.
