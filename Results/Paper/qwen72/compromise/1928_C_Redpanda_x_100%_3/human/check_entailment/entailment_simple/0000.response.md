### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and it alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of valid `k` values using the function `func_1` and the generator `generate`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to find all divisors of `n` that are even and greater than or equal to `2x - 2`.
   - It first performs prime factorization of `n` and stores the factors in a dictionary.
   - It then uses the `generate` function to yield all possible divisors of `n` based on the prime factors.

4. **Function `generate`**:
   - This is a recursive generator function that generates all divisors of a number given its prime factors.
   - It correctly handles the base case when `k` equals the length of the `primes` list, yielding 1.
   - For each prime factor, it multiplies the current factor by the prime raised to different powers and yields the results.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates two sets of possible `k` values: one for `n - x` and another for `n + x - 2`.
   - It then combines these sets and prints the length of the union, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The prime factorization and divisor generation in `func_1` and `generate` are correct.
   - The conditions for filtering valid `k` values (`not k % 2` and `k / 2 + 1 >= x`) are appropriate.
   - The logic for handling the two cases (`n - x` and `n + x - 2`) is sound and aligns with the problem description.

However, there is a minor issue in the state description of `func_1`:
- The comment `If nn > 1, factors[1] is increased by 1. Otherwise, factors remains unchanged.` is incorrect. It should be `If nn > 1, factors[nn] is increased by 1. Otherwise, factors remains unchanged.`

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem constraints. The minor issue in the state description does not affect the correctness of the program's implementation.
