Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k] * primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is `factors[prime]`, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation:
- `prime_to_i` is updated by multiplying its current value by `prime`.
- The initial value of `prime_to_i` is `primes[k]`, so after the multiplication, `prime_to_i` becomes `primes[k] * primes[k]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
