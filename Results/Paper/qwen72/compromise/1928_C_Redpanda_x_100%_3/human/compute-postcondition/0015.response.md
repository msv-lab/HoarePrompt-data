Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1, `_` is 2, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to `prime * prime * prime` because `prime_to_i` was initially `prime * prime` and is multiplied by `prime` again.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
