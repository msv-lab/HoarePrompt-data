Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly address the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - It determines the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` using a loop.
   - It constructs the initial part of the sequence `ans` with three specific values: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - It then appends all powers of 2 (from `1` to `2^19`) except for `1 << i` to the sequence `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence `ans`.
   - It prints the elements of the sequence `ans`.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
  - The sequence includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, which ensures that no combination of these values will sum to `k`.
  - The powers of 2 added to the sequence do not contribute to forming a sum of `k` because they are either too small or too large when combined with the other elements.

- **All Other Sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`)**:
  - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to `2^19`, which allows for the formation of any sum up to `2^20 - 1` (which is much larger than `n`).
  - The additional elements `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` ensure that all sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by appropriate combinations of these elements and the powers of 2.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program appears to generate a valid sequence for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
