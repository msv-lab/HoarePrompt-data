Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`:**
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
   - The while loop finds the largest integer `i` such that \( 1 << i \leq k \). This effectively finds the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence `ans`:**
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three specific values: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
     - `k - (1 << i)` ensures that the sequence can form sums close to `k` but not exactly `k`.
     - `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` help cover a range of values greater than `k`.
   - The loop appends all powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, excluding `1 << i`. This ensures that the sequence can form a wide range of sums, including all values from 1 to `n` except `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the sequence `ans`.
   - It then prints the elements of the sequence `ans`.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
  - The sequence `ans` is constructed to avoid forming a subsequence that sums to `k`. By including `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and excluding `1 << i` from the powers of 2, the program ensures that no combination of these elements can sum to `k`.

- **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
  - The inclusion of all powers of 2 (except one) allows the sequence to form any sum that is a combination of these powers. Since the sequence includes `k + 1` and other values, it can form sums up to `n` while avoiding `k`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases well by ensuring that the sequence can form all required sums while avoiding `k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
