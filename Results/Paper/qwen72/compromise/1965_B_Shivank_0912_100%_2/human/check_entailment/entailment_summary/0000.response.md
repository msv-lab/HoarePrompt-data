Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The program determines the largest integer `i` such that \( 1 << i \leq k \). This is done using a while loop.
   - It initializes the sequence `ans` with three specific values: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - It then appends all powers of 2 up to \( 1 << 19 \) to `ans`, except for \( 1 << i \).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence `ans` and the sequence itself for each test case.

### Verification of Conditions:

- **Condition 1: No subsequence of `a` should have a sum of `k`**:
  - The sequence `ans` is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k`. By including `k - (1 << i)` and excluding \( 1 << i \), the program ensures that no combination of elements in `ans` can sum to `k`.

- **Condition 2: For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there should be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`**:
  - The sequence `ans` includes all powers of 2 up to \( 1 << 19 \) except one, which allows for a wide range of sums. By including `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, the program ensures that all values from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed as a sum of some subsequence of `ans`.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The program handles the constraints \( 1 \le t \le 1000 \), \( 2 \le n \le 10^6 \), and \( 1 \le k \le n \).
- The sequence `ans` is limited to a maximum of 25 elements, which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly generate sequences that meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
