Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 19, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4, `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << 0), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << 0)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` except for `1 << 0`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
