The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts at least one parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two additional parameters `n` and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically in such scenarios, the function would process each test case and return a result for each case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
