The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `tc` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be at least 1, and `tc` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `tc`.

State: **`t` must be at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), and `j` is 19. The list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` except for `1 << i`.**
