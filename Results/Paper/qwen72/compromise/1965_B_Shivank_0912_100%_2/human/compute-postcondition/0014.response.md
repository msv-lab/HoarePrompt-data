Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, `j` is 0, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending `1 << j` to the list. Since `j` is 0, `1 << j` evaluates to `1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `j` is not equal to `i` remains valid.
