To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`.

- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.
- The variable `tc` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 (as per Python's `range` function).

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `tc` starts at 0.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0**
