Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 20, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \). If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576, 1048576]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576]`.***
