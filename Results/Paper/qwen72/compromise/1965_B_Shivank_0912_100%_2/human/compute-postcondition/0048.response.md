To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: At least 2.
2. **`tc`**: 1.
3. **`i`**: The largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \).
4. **`j`**: 19.
5. **`n`**: An input integer.
6. **`k`**: An input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \).

### Construction of `ans`:
- The list `ans` starts with three specific elements:
  - `k - (1 << i)`
  - `k + 1`
  - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
- Followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, excluding `1 << i`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \). This means \( i \) is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Initial Elements of `ans`**:
   - `k - (1 << i)`: This is the first element.
   - `k + 1`: This is the second element.
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This is the third element.

3. **Powers of 2**:
   - We need to include the powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, but exclude `1 << i`.
   - There are 20 powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` (inclusive).
   - Excluding one of them (specifically `1 << i`), we have 19 remaining powers of 2.

4. **Total Length of `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` starts with 3 elements.
   - It then adds 19 more elements (the powers of 2 excluding `1 << i`).
   - Therefore, the total length of `ans` is \( 3 + 19 = 22 \).

### Final Output:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the list `ans`, which is 22.

Output: **22**
