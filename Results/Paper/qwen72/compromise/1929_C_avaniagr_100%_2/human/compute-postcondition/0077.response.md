Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9. The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least `t + 1` lines. For each line `s` from the second to the `t + 1`-th line, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers read from that line. If `x < k - 1`, then the output is 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise 'NO'. If `x == k - 1`, then the output is 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, otherwise 'NO'. If `x > k - 1`, then `z` is updated by the nested loop to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`, and the output is 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise 'NO'.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case consists of integers `k`, `x`, and `a` within their respective ranges.
- The loop iterates `t` times, processing each line from the second to the `t + 1`-th line of the file.
- For each test case, the loop checks the conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
  - If `x` is less than `k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is at least `x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
  - If `x` is exactly `k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is at least `x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
  - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, the program calculates `z` using a nested loop that updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` iterations. After the nested loop, the program checks if `a` is at least `z`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- The final output state is the result of all these checks for each test case, and the file must have at least `t + 1` lines to ensure all test cases are processed.
