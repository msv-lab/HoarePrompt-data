Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, and `s` is the second line of the file. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 2`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k`, then after all iterations, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the current value of `a` remains greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, the current value of `a` is less than `z`.***
