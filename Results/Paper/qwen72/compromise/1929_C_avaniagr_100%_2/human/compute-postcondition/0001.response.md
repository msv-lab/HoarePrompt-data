Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, and `s` is the second line of the file.**

Explanation:
- The code `k, x, a = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` into parts using whitespace as the delimiter and converts each part to an integer.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the integer values from the split string `s`.
- The constraints on `k`, `x`, and `a` are now specific based on the values read from `s`.
- The initial state of `t` and the file opened by `open(0)` remain unchanged.
- The value of `s` is still the second line of the file, but it is no longer relevant since its content has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`.
