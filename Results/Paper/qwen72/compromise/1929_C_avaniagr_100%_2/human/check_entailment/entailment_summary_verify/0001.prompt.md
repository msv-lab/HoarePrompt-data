You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case is defined by three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (with constraints 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9). For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, if `x < k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise 'NO'. If `x == k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, otherwise 'NO'. If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` using a nested loop and prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place bets in a casino where if he wins, his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \) and if he loses, he loses \( y \) coins.
   - He cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has \( a \) coins.
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Strategy:**
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can place bets such that he can always recover from any sequence of losses. Specifically, he can place a bet of 1 coin after each win and a bet of 2 coins after each loss.
   - If \( x = k - 1 \), Sasha needs to place bets such that he can recover from \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses. This requires a slightly larger initial amount of coins.
   - If \( x > k - 1 \), Sasha needs to place bets that can handle more than \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses. This requires a more complex strategy and a larger initial amount of coins.

3. **Breaking Down the Program:**
   - The program reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions.
   - The conditions are:
     - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can win if \( a \geq x + 1 \).
     - If \( x = k - 1 \), Sasha can win if \( a \geq x + 2 \).
     - If \( x > k - 1 \), the program calculates a threshold \( z \) and checks if \( a \geq z \).

4. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
     - Sasha can place bets of 1 coin after each win and 2 coins after each loss. This strategy ensures that he can always recover from any sequence of losses.
     - The condition \( a \geq x + 1 \) is correct because it ensures Sasha has enough coins to place bets and recover from \( x \) losses.
   - **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**
     - Sasha needs to place bets that can handle \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses. The condition \( a \geq x + 2 \) is correct because it ensures Sasha has enough coins to place bets and recover from \( k - 1 \) losses plus an additional bet.
   - **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
     - The program calculates a threshold \( z \) using a loop. The loop increments \( z \) based on the number of consecutive losses \( x \) and the multiplier \( k \).
     - The condition \( a \geq z \) is used to determine if Sasha has enough initial coins to guarantee he can win any number of coins.
     - The calculation of \( z \) is complex and needs to be verified.

5. **Verification of the Threshold Calculation:**
   - The loop in the program:
     ```python
     z = k - 2
     for i in range(x - k + 3):
         z += z // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
   - This loop is intended to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee he can win any number of coins. However, the logic is not immediately clear and may need further verification.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The conditions for \( x < k - 1 \) and \( x = k - 1 \) are correct.
   - The logic for \( x > k - 1 \) is more complex and may not be fully correct. The threshold calculation \( z \) needs to be verified to ensure it correctly handles the case where Sasha can have more than \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program's logic for \( x > k - 1 \) is not clearly correct and needs further verification. The threshold calculation \( z \) may not accurately reflect the minimum number of coins required to guarantee winning any number of coins.
