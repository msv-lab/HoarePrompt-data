### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place bets in a casino where if he wins, his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \) and if he loses, he loses \( y \) coins.
   - He cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has \( a \) coins.
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Strategy:**
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can place bets such that he can always recover from any sequence of losses. Specifically, he can place a bet of 1 coin after each win and a bet of 2 coins after each loss.
   - If \( x = k - 1 \), Sasha needs to place bets such that he can recover from \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses. This requires a slightly larger initial amount of coins.
   - If \( x > k - 1 \), Sasha needs to place bets that can handle more than \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses. This requires a more complex strategy and a larger initial amount of coins.

3. **Breaking Down the Program:**
   - The program reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions.
   - The conditions are:
     - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can win if \( a \geq x + 1 \).
     - If \( x = k - 1 \), Sasha can win if \( a \geq x + 2 \).
     - If \( x > k - 1 \), the program calculates a threshold \( z \) and checks if \( a \geq z \).

4. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
     - Sasha can place bets of 1 coin after each win and 2 coins after each loss. This strategy ensures that he can always recover from any sequence of losses.
     - The condition \( a \geq x + 1 \) is correct because it ensures Sasha has enough coins to place bets and recover from \( x \) losses.
   - **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**
     - Sasha needs to place bets that can handle \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses. The condition \( a \geq x + 2 \) is correct because it ensures Sasha has enough coins to place bets and recover from \( k - 1 \) losses plus an additional bet.
   - **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
     - The program calculates a threshold \( z \) using a loop. The loop increments \( z \) based on the number of consecutive losses \( x \) and the multiplier \( k \).
     - The condition \( a \geq z \) is used to determine if Sasha has enough initial coins to guarantee he can win any number of coins.
     - The calculation of \( z \) is as follows:
       ```python
       z = k - 2
       for i in range(x - k + 3):
           z += z // (k - 1) + 1
       ```
     - This loop is intended to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee he can win any number of coins. Let's analyze the logic:
       - Initially, \( z = k - 2 \).
       - For each additional loss beyond \( k - 1 \), \( z \) is incremented by \( z // (k - 1) + 1 \).
       - This increment ensures that Sasha can recover from the additional losses by placing bets that are multiples of the previous bet amounts.

5. **Verification of the Threshold Calculation:**
   - The loop in the program:
     ```python
     z = k - 2
     for i in range(x - k + 3):
         z += z // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
   - This loop is designed to handle the case where Sasha can have more than \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses. The increment \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \) is a valid way to ensure that Sasha can recover from the additional losses.
   - The initial value \( z = k - 2 \) is chosen to account for the first \( k - 1 \) losses, and the loop ensures that Sasha can handle the remaining losses by incrementing \( z \) appropriately.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The conditions for \( x < k - 1 \) and \( x = k - 1 \) are correct.
   - The logic for \( x > k - 1 \) is also correct. The threshold calculation \( z \) accurately reflects the minimum number of coins required to guarantee winning any number of coins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program's logic for all cases is correct and accurately reflects the minimum number of coins required to guarantee winning any number of coins.

Final: **True**
