Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that the input string `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. This is consistent with the problem description, and the function does not need to validate the input further.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the balance of the prefix for each character in the string `s`. The balance is incremented for an opening parenthesis `(` and decremented for a closing parenthesis `)`.

3. **Details List Construction**: The function constructs a list of tuples `details` where each tuple contains the balance of the prefix, the negative index, and the character. The negative index is used to break ties in the sorting step by ensuring that characters with the same balance are sorted in decreasing order of their original positions.

4. **Sorting**: The function sorts the `details` list based on the prefix balance in increasing order and the negative index in decreasing order. This sorting step is crucial for the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.

5. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the function constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list of tuples. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method, which is efficient and correct.

6. **Output**: The function prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

Given that the function follows the steps described in the problem and handles the input and output correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
