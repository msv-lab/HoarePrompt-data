Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is the result of `ai` XOR `val`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the 29th bit of the first element in `a`, and if `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.***
