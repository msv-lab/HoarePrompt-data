The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. It shifts the value of `val` right by `i` positions, then applies a bitwise AND with 1, and finally XORs the result with `op`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 29.
- `u` is 0.
- `v` is even.
- `op` is 0.
- `ai` is 0.
- `val` is the first element in the list `a`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions (29 positions).
2. `val >> i & 1` applies a bitwise AND with 1, which isolates the bit at position 29.
3. `op ^= val >> i & 1` XORs the result with `op`.

Since `op` is initially 0, the result of the XOR operation will be the value of `val >> i & 1`.

Let's assume `val` is the first element of `a`, and let's denote it as `a[0]`. The value of `a[0] >> 29 & 1` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the 29th bit of `a[0]`.

Therefore, the new value of `op` will be:
- 0 if the 29th bit of `a[0]` is 0.
- 1 if the 29th bit of `a[0]` is 1.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the 29th bit of the first element in `a`, `ai` is 0, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
