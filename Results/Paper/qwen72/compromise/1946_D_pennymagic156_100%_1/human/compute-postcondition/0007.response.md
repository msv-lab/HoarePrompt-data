Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. If the bit at position 29 of `x` (`u`) is 0 and the sum of the bits at position 29 of each element in `a` (`v`) is 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.***
