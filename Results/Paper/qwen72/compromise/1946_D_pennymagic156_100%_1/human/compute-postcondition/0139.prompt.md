Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 27, `u` is updated to `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is updated to `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`. If `u` and `v` are both 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 27, `u` is updated to `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is updated to `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the first element of `a`, `op` is `val >> 27 & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`. If `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, and `t` is a list containing 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is `(val >> 27 & 1) ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`, `ai` is 0, and `t` is a list containing 0 and 0 if `op` is 0. Otherwise, `ai` remains `ai ^ val` and `t` remains a list containing 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is `val >> 27 & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`. If `op` is 0, `ai` is 0 and `t` is a list containing 0, 0, and 0. Otherwise, `t` remains a list containing 0 and `ai`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
