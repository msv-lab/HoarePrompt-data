Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is a list containing the results of `ai` being reset to 0 whenever `op` is 0, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the result of the XOR operation on the 29th bit of all elements in `a`, and `ai` is 0 if `op` was 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise it is the XOR of all elements in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `x`**: These values are updated to the values returned by `func_3()` and remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`a`**: This is the input list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and it remains unchanged.
- **`t`**: This list accumulates the value of `ai` whenever `op` is 0. After the loop, `t` will contain these accumulated values.
- **`ans`**: This variable remains -1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: This variable remains 29 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`u`**: This variable remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`v`**: This variable remains even as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`op`**: This variable is the result of the XOR operation on the 29th bit of all elements in `a`. If the 29th bit of all elements in `a` is the same, `op` will be 0; otherwise, it will be 1.
- **`ai`**: This variable is updated to `ai ^ val` for each element in `a`. If `op` is 0 at any point, `ai` is reset to 0. After the loop, `ai` will be 0 if `op` was 0 at any point, otherwise, it will be the XOR of all elements in `a`.
