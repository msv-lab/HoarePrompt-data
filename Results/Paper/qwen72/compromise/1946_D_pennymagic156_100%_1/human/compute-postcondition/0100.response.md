The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 28.
   - `u` is `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0).
   - `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero).
   - `op` is the next `val >> 28 & 1`.
   - `a` is a list that must have at least two elements.
   - `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged.
   - If the new `op` is 0, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The expression `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by 28 bits and then applies a bitwise AND with 1. This effectively extracts the 29th bit from the right (bit position 28) of `val`.
   - The result of `val >> i & 1` is then XORed with `op`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the value of `val >> 28 & 1` as `bit_val`.
   - The new value of `op` will be `op ^ bit_val`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `i` remains 28.
   - `u` remains `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0).
   - `v` remains `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero).
   - `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`.
   - `a` remains a list that must have at least two elements.
   - `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged.
   - If the new `op` is 0, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero), `op` is `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`, `a` is a list that must have at least two elements, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged, if the new `op` is 0 then `cnt` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.**
