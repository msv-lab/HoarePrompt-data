The given code snippet performs a bitwise operation on the variable `op`. Specifically, it updates `op` using the XOR (`^`) operation with the result of shifting `val` right by `i` bits and then performing a bitwise AND with 1.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `val` is the first element in the list `a`.
- `i` is an index, which is not specified in the initial state, but it is used in the right shift operation.
- The expression `val >> i` shifts the binary representation of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- The expression `val >> i & 1` extracts the bit at position `i` from `val`.
- The expression `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates `op` by performing an XOR operation with the extracted bit.

Since `op` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is initially 0 (or some other initial value, but we'll consider 0 for simplicity).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Extract the bit at position `i` from `val`:**
   - Let `bit_i = val >> i & 1`.
   - This will give us the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `val`.

2. **Update `op` using the XOR operation:**
   - `op ^= bit_i`.
   - This means `op` will be updated to `op ^ bit_i`.

### Output State:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element.
- `val` is the first element in `a`.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element, `val` is the first element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.**
