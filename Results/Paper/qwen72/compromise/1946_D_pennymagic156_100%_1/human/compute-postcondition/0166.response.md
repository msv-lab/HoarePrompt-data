Postcondition: ***`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`. If `u` is 0, `a` is a list containing 0 for each element in the original `a` where the bit at position 27 is 0, `op` is the XOR of all bits at position 27 of the elements in the original `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a` where the bit at position 27 is 1, `t` is an empty list, and `n`, `x`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. If `u` is not 0, `u` remains as `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` remains as `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, and all other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `op`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. If `v` is odd, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the XOR of the 28th bit (from the right) of all elements in `a`, `cnt` is the number of times `op` was 0 during the loop's execution, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, the loop or the most internal if statement is exited.***
