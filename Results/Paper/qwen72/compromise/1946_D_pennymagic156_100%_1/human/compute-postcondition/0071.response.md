The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Given that `ai` is `val`, and `val` is the first element of `a`, the value of `val` is appended to `t`.

Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is 0, `ai` is `val`, `a` must have at least one element, `val` is the first element of `a`, `t` now contains `val` as its last element.**
