The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 27
- `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`
- `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`
- `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements
- `val` is the third element of `a`
- `op` is `val >> 27 & 1`
- `ai` is `ai ^ val`
- `t` is a list containing 0 and 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains a list containing 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `t` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `ai`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is `val >> 27 & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is a list containing 0, 0, and `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is a list containing 0 and `ai`.**
