Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is the value of the bit at position 29 of `x`, `v` is the sum of the bits at position 29 of each element in `a`.**

Explanation:
- `u` is assigned the value of the bit at position 29 of `x` (i.e., `x >> 29 & 1`).
- `v` is assigned the sum of the bits at position 29 of each element in the list `a` (i.e., `sum([(val >> 29 & 1) for val in a])`).
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
