Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` has at least two elements, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the XOR of the original `op` and the 29th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is False, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, and `t` is now `t` with `ai` appended to it if `op` is False, otherwise `t` remains unchanged.***
