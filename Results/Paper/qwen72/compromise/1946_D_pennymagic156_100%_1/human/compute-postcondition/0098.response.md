Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero), `op` is `val >> 28 & 1`, `a` is a list that must have at least one element, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged. If `op` is 0, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.***
