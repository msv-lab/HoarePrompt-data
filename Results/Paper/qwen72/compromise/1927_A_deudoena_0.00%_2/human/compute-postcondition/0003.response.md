Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `inpstr` is an input string, the function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**

The variable `outind` is initialized to 0, while the values of `ind1`, `ind2`, and `inpstr` remain unchanged. The function's parameters and constraints also remain the same.
