Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program aims to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string and then calculates the length of the segment that needs to be painted. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that there might be white cells ('W') between the first and last black cells ('B') that do not need to be painted.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to find the minimum continuous segment that includes all the black cells ('B'). This can be done by identifying the first and last black cells and then calculating the length of the segment between them, inclusive.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        ind1 = -1
        ind2 = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == 'B':
                if ind1 == -1:
                    ind1 = i  # First occurrence of 'B'
                ind2 = i  # Last occurrence of 'B'
        print(ind2 - ind1 + 1 if ind1 != -1 else 1)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s`.
3. **Identify First and Last 'B'**:
   - `ind1` is initialized to -1 and will store the index of the first black cell.
   - `ind2` is initialized to -1 and will store the index of the last black cell.
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` to find the first and last black cells.
4. **Calculate Segment Length**:
   - If `ind1` is not -1, it means there is at least one black cell, and the length of the segment to be painted is `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.
   - If `ind1` is -1, it means there are no black cells, but the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this case should never occur. However, for completeness, the program prints 1 in this case.

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white.
