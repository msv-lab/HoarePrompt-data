Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem states that the input will consist of multiple test cases, each with its own strip length and strip configuration. However, the program only reads a single string input and processes it, which means it will fail when given multiple test cases as specified.

Additionally, the program does not handle the input of the number of test cases `t` and the length of the strip `n` for each test case. Instead, it directly reads the strip configuration as a string, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
6
WBBWBW
1
B
2
WB
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
1
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

The program only processes the first test case and does not handle the subsequent test cases, leading to incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
