Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in a string. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` that is constructed as follows: If `n` is even, `ans` is a string where each character from the uppercase alphabet is repeated twice, up to `n // 2` characters. If `n` is odd and at least 3, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and is followed by each character from the uppercase alphabet (starting from the second character) repeated twice, up to `n // 2 - 1` additional characters. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no further changes to the program state. **
