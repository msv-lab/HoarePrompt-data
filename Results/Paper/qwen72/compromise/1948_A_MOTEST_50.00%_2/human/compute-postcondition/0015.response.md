Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s`, repeated twice, to the existing value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains the first character of `s` repeated twice, and `x` is 1. After executing the code, `ans` will contain the first character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
