Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer.** 

The code snippet provided only updates the value of `n` by taking an integer input from the user. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `x`, `j`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet, so their potential updates based on the value of `n` are not reflected in the output state.
