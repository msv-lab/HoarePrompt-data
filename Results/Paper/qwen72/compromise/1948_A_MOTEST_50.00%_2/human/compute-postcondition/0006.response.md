The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The precondition provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and the current value of `n`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the precondition and will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
