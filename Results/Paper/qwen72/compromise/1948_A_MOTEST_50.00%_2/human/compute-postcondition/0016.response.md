Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 2, `j` is 1**. 

The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, so `x` is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
