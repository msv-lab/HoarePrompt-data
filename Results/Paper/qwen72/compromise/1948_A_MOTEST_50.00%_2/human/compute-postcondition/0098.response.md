Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and at least 5, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2 + ... + `s[n // 2 - 1]` * 2, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.***
