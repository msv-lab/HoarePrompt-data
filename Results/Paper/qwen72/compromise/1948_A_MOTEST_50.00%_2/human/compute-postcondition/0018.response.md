Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 4, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the third character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 2, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice.
- The initial value of `ans` was the first character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice.
- After the code execution, `ans` now includes the third character of `s` repeated twice.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
