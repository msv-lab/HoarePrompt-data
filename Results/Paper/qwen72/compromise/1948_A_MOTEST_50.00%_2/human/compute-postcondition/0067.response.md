Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `ans` is the string `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2 + ... + s[(n // 2) - 1] * 2`. If `n` is odd, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + ... + s[n//2 - 1] * 2`.***
