Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `t` which is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling**: 
   - If `n == 1`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. A single character cannot be equal to both its neighbors if it only has one neighbor.
   - For `n > 1`, the program proceeds to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating each letter from the uppercase alphabet twice, enough times to have `n` special characters. For example, for `n = 6`, the string "AAABBB" has 6 special characters (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" (which has 3 special characters at positions 1, 3, and 5) and then continues to append pairs of letters from the uppercase alphabet. For example, for `n = 5`, the string "AAABBB" has 5 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string if `n > 1`.
   - It prints 'NO' if `n == 1`.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. It ensures that the string length does not exceed 200 and that the number of special characters is exactly `n` for valid cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
