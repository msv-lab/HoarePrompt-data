Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, and for each iteration, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `x`, `j`, or `ans` for that iteration. If `n` is even, `ans` for that iteration is a string containing each character of `s` from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1` repeated twice, and `x` is set to `n // 2`, `j` is set to `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and at least 5, `ans` for that iteration is 'AAA' + each character of `s` from index 1 to `n // 2 - 1` repeated twice, and `x` is set to `n // 2`, `j` is set to `n // 2 - 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in a string. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` that is constructed as follows: If `n` is even, `ans` is a string where each character from the uppercase alphabet is repeated twice, up to `n // 2` characters. If `n` is odd and at least 3, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and is followed by each character from the uppercase alphabet (starting from the second character) repeated twice, up to `n // 2 - 1` additional characters. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no further changes to the program state.
