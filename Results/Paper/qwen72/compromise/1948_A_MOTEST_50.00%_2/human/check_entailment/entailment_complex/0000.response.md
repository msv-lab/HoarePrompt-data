Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Special Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the special case where `n` is 1. Since a string with exactly one special character cannot be constructed (as a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and a single character cannot satisfy this condition), the function prints 'NO' for this case, which is correct.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the function constructs a string where each character from the uppercase alphabet is repeated twice, up to `n // 2` characters. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, meeting the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
   - For odd `n` (and `n` is at least 3), the function starts the string with 'AAA' and then continues to append each character from the uppercase alphabet (starting from the second character) repeated twice, up to `n // 2 - 1` additional characters. This ensures that the first three characters are special, and the rest of the characters are also special, meeting the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Output**: The function prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string for valid cases, and 'NO' for the invalid case (`n = 1`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - For `n = 2`, the function constructs a string 'AA', which has exactly 2 special characters.
   - For `n = 3`, the function constructs a string 'AAA', which has exactly 3 special characters.
   - For larger odd and even values of `n`, the function constructs strings that meet the requirements.

6. **Length Constraint**: The function ensures that the constructed string has a length of at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
