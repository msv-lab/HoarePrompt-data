You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

                    x += 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, and for each iteration, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `x`, `j`, or `ans` for that iteration. If `n` is even, `ans` for that iteration is a string containing each character of `s` from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1` repeated twice, and `x` is set to `n // 2`, `j` is set to `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and at least 5, `ans` for that iteration is 'AAA' + each character of `s` from index 1 to `n // 2 - 1` repeated twice, and `x` is set to `n // 2`, `j` is set to `n // 2 - 2`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by clearing the console using `os.system('cls')`. This is not necessary for the problem and can be omitted, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - It then reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and processes it.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have a string with exactly one special character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a special character must have at least one neighbor, and if there is only one special character, it cannot be equal to both neighbors.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is not 1, the program constructs a string `ans`:
     - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating each letter from `string.ascii_uppercase` twice until the length of the string is `n`.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with the string "AAA" (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to repeat each letter from `string.ascii_uppercase` twice until the length of the string is `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Even `n`**:
  - For even `n`, the program correctly constructs a string where each pair of consecutive characters is the same, ensuring that each character in the pair is a special character.
  - The length of the string is exactly `n`, and each character is special because it is equal to one of its neighbors.

- **Odd `n`**:
  - For odd `n`, the program starts with "AAA" (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to add pairs of characters.
  - The total number of special characters in the string will be `n` because the initial "AAA" contributes 3 special characters, and the remaining pairs contribute 2 special characters each.
  - The length of the string will be `n + 1` (since "AAA" is 3 characters and each pair is 2 characters), but this is within the allowed length of 200.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 by printing "NO".
  - It also handles the case where `n` is 2 by constructing "MM" (which has 2 special characters).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given requirements and edge cases. It constructs a valid string for even and odd `n` and prints "NO" for `n = 1`.

### Correctness:
**True**
