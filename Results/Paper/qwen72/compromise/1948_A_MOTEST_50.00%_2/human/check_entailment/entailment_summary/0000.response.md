Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the special case where `n` is 1. According to the problem description, a string with exactly 1 special character cannot be constructed because a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and a single character cannot satisfy this condition. Therefore, printing 'NO' for `n == 1` is correct.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the function constructs a string where each character from the uppercase alphabet is repeated twice, up to `n // 2` characters. This ensures that each character in the string is a special character because each character is equal to its neighbor.
   - For odd `n` and at least 3, the function starts with 'AAA' and then continues to append each character from the uppercase alphabet (starting from the second character) repeated twice, up to `n // 2 - 1` additional characters. This ensures that the first three characters are special, and the remaining characters are also special because they are repeated twice.

4. **Output Format**: The function prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string for valid cases, and 'NO' for the case where `n` is 1. This matches the required output format.

5. **Length Constraint**: The function ensures that the length of the constructed string does not exceed 200 characters, which is within the problem's constraints.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as `n = 1` and `n = 3`.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
