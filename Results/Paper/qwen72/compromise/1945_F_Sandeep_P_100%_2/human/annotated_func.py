#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of n integers where each integer represents the magic power of a mushroom, and p is a permutation list of integers from 1 to n representing the order in which the magic powers of the mushrooms will become 0 if they are not picked.
