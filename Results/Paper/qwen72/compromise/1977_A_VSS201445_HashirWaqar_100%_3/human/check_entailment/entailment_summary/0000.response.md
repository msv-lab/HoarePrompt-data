Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. The key observation here is that the number of moves `n` must be at least as large as the number of cubes `m` to be able to build the tower. Additionally, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out, effectively doing nothing to the tower's height. If `n - m` is odd, it means that the number of moves that add a cube and the number of moves that remove a cube cannot balance out to leave exactly `m` cubes.

The program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
3. It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
4. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and applying the correct logic to determine the output.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
