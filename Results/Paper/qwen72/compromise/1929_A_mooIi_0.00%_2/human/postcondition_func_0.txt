The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, sorts the list in non-decreasing order, and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and the input lists remain unchanged, but the sorted lists have been printed for each test case.
