The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.
