You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind

        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `i` is `n-1`. `n` remains unchanged. `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[1]` is 1, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[3]` is 3, `p[4]` is `n-4`, `p[5]` is 5, and so on, with `p[j]` being `j + 1` for all odd indices `j` from 1 to `n - 1`, and `p[k]` being `n - k` for all even indices `k` from 0 to `n - 2`. `ind` is `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for any two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j), `p_i` does not divide `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` does not divide `p_{j+1}`.
   - This means that no two consecutive elements in the permutation should have a relationship where one divides the other.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the list `p` in a specific pattern:
     - First, it fills the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
     - Then, it fills the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) with the smallest even numbers in ascending order.

3. **Pattern Explanation**:
   - By placing the largest odd numbers in the even indices and the smallest even numbers in the odd indices, the program ensures that:
     - No two consecutive elements are both odd or both even.
     - The even indices contain the largest odd numbers, which are less likely to divide any other number in the permutation.
     - The odd indices contain the smallest even numbers, which are less likely to be divided by any other number in the permutation.

4. **Validation**:
   - For `n = 4`, the program generates `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - `4` (even) does not divide `1` (odd).
     - `1` (odd) does not divide `2` (even).
     - `2` (even) does not divide `3` (odd).
   - For `n = 3`, the program generates `[3, 1, 2]`.
     - `3` (odd) does not divide `1` (odd).
     - `1` (odd) does not divide `2` (even).

5. **General Case**:
   - The pattern ensures that no two consecutive elements are both odd or both even, which inherently avoids the division condition.
   - The largest odd numbers are placed in even indices, and the smallest even numbers are placed in odd indices, ensuring that the division condition is not met for any pair of consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
