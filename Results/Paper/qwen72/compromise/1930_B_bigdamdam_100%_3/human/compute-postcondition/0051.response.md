Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n - (n % 2)`.
2. `n` remains the same.
3. `p[1]` is `1 + n % 2`.
4. `p[3]` is `3 + n % 2`.
5. `p[5]` is `5 + n % 2`.
6. This pattern continues up to `p[n - (n % 2) - 1]` which is `n - 1`.
7. The rest of the elements in `p` are zeros.
8. `ind` is `n - (n % 2) + 1 + n % 2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `i`**:
   - `i` is `n - (n % 2)`.
   - This means `i` is the largest even number less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Calculate `ind`**:
   - `ind` is `n - (n % 2) + 1 + n % 2`.
   - Simplifying this, `ind` is `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the structure of `p`**:
   - `p` is a list where the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., `n - (n % 2) - 1`) are set to specific values.
   - The values at these odd indices are `1 + n % 2`, `3 + n % 2`, `5 + n % 2`, ..., `n - 1`.
   - The rest of the elements in `p` are zeros.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider a few examples to understand the pattern better.

#### Example 1: `n = 5`
- `i` is `5 - (5 % 2) = 5 - 1 = 4`.
- `ind` is `5 - (5 % 2) + 1 + 5 % 2 = 5 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 6`.
- `p` will be a list of length 6.
- `p[1]` is `1 + 5 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- `p[3]` is `3 + 5 % 2 = 3 + 1 = 4`.
- The rest of the elements in `p` are zeros.
- Therefore, `p` is `[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0]`.

#### Example 2: `n = 6`
- `i` is `6 - (6 % 2) = 6 - 0 = 6`.
- `ind` is `6 - (6 % 2) + 1 + 6 % 2 = 6 - 0 + 1 + 0 = 7`.
- `p` will be a list of length 7.
- `p[1]` is `1 + 6 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.
- `p[3]` is `3 + 6 % 2 = 3 + 0 = 3`.
- `p[5]` is `5 + 6 % 2 = 5 + 0 = 5`.
- The rest of the elements in `p` are zeros.
- Therefore, `p` is `[0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0]`.

### General Pattern:
- For any `n`, the list `p` will have a length of `n + 1`.
- The elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., `n - (n % 2) - 1`) will be set to `1 + n % 2`, `3 + n % 2`, `5 + n % 2`, ..., `n - 1`.
- The rest of the elements in `p` will be zeros.

### Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **0, 1 + n % 2, 0, 3 + n % 2, 0, 5 + n % 2, ..., 0, n - 1, 0 (where the list `p` has a length of `n + 1` and the elements at odd indices are set according to the given pattern, and the rest are zeros)**
