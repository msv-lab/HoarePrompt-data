Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is `n - 4`, `iterations` is greater than the number of iterations completed.**

The value of `ind` has been updated to `n - 4` after the code execution. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
