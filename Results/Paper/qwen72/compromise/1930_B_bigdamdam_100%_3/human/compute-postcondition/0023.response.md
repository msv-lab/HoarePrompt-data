Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `p` is a list where the elements at even indices are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`, and the element at index 1 is `ind` (7 if `n` is odd, or 8 if `n` is even), `p[3]` is `ind` (7 if `n` is odd, or 8 if `n` is even), and `p[5]` is `ind` (7 if `n` is odd, or 8 if `n` is even).** 

The value of `ind` has been incremented by 2. If `n` is odd, `ind` is now 7. If `n` is even, `ind` is now 8. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The elements in the list `p` at even indices and at indices 1, 3, and 5 are updated to reflect the new value of `ind`.
