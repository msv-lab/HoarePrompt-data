The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop increments `i` by 2 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 2, the new value of `i` will be 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the second element is `n - 2`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`**
