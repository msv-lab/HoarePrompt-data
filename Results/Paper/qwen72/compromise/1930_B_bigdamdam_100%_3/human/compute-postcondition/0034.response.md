Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is `n - 2`, `iterations` is greater than the number of iterations completed.** 

The value of `p[2]` is updated to `n - 2`, which is the value of `ind`. The other variables remain unchanged.
