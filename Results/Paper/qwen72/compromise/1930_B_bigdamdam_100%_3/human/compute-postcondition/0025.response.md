Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. The loop has completed all its iterations.
2. `i` is `n-2` if `n` is even, or `n-3` if `n` is odd.
3. `n` remains unchanged.
4. `p` is a list where:
   - The elements at even indices (starting from 0) are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`.
   - The elements at odd indices (starting from 1) are `ind` values incremented by 2 for each iteration, up to the last odd index that is less than `n`.
5. `ind` is the value it was at the start of the loop plus 2 times the number of iterations the loop completed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `i` based on `n`:**
   - If `n` is even, `i = n - 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, `i = n - 3`.

2. **Construct the list `p`:**
   - **Even Indices:**
     - The elements at even indices are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`.
     - This sequence starts at `n` and decreases by 2 for each subsequent even index.
   - **Odd Indices:**
     - The elements at odd indices are `ind` values incremented by 2 for each iteration.
     - The initial value of `ind` is not specified, but it is incremented by 2 for each iteration.
     - The number of iterations is determined by the length of the list `p` divided by 2 (since each iteration fills one even and one odd index).

3. **Determine the number of iterations:**
   - The number of iterations is `i // 2 + 1` if `i` is even, or `i // 2 + 1` if `i` is odd.
   - This is because `i` is the last index used for the even sequence, and each iteration fills one even and one odd index.

4. **Construct the list `p` with specific values:**
   - **Even Indices:**
     - The sequence is `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`.
   - **Odd Indices:**
     - The sequence is `ind, ind+2, ind+4, ..., ind + 2 * (i // 2)`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 6` (even) and `ind = 1` (initial value of `ind`).

1. **Determine `i`:**
   - Since `n` is even, `i = n - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4`.

2. **Construct the list `p`:**
   - **Even Indices:**
     - `p[0] = 6`
     - `p[2] = 6 - 2 = 4`
     - `p[4] = 6 - 4 = 2`
   - **Odd Indices:**
     - `p[1] = 1`
     - `p[3] = 1 + 2 = 3`
   - The list `p` will be `[6, 1, 4, 3, 2]`.

### General Case:
For a general `n` and `ind`:
- **Even Indices:**
  - The sequence is `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`.
- **Odd Indices:**
  - The sequence is `ind, ind+2, ind+4, ..., ind + 2 * (i // 2)`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces. The elements at even indices are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`, and the elements at odd indices are `ind, ind+2, ind+4, ..., ind + 2 * (i // 2)`.

Output: **n, ind, n-2, ind+2, n-4, ind+4, ..., n-(i*2), ind + 2 * (i // 2) (where n is the value of n, ind is the initial value of ind, and i is n-2 if n is even or n-3 if n is odd)**
