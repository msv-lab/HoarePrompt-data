Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters must equal `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a 3-letter word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Constructing the Word**:
   - The program uses a series of conditions to determine the lexicographically smallest word:
     - If `n > 52`, it constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. This is because the maximum sum of two letters is 52 (26 + 26), so the first letter must be at least `n - 52` to reach `n`.
     - If `n > 26`, it constructs the word by adding 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 28` and then 'z'. This is because the maximum sum of the last two letters is 52, so the first letter is 'a' (1) and the second letter must be at least `n - 27` to reach `n`, with 'z' being the largest possible third letter.
     - If `n <= 26`, it constructs the word by adding 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 3`. This is because the sum of the first two letters is 2 (1 + 1), so the third letter must be `n - 2`.

4. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - For `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This is correct because the first letter must be at least `n - 52` to reach `n`, and 'zz' is the largest possible combination for the last two letters.
   - For `26 < n <= 52`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This is correct because the first letter is 'a' (1), and the second letter must be at least `n - 27` to reach `n`, with 'z' being the largest possible third letter.
   - For `n <= 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This is correct because the first two letters are 'a' (1 + 1), and the third letter must be `n - 2`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1).
     - For `n = 52`, the word is 'azz' (1 + 26 + 25).
     - For `n = 78`, the word is 'zzz' (26 + 26 + 26).

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which is the expected output format.

7. **Verification with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the `word` variable is reset to an empty string at the beginning of each iteration, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.
   - The `alphabet` variable remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which is correct for the problem's requirements.
   - The conditions and logic used to construct the word are consistent with the annotated code and the problem description.

Based on the above reasoning and the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for the given sum `n`.

Final: **True**
