Functionality: ** The function `func` does not return any value but prints a series of three-letter words to the console. It reads an integer from the user, which specifies the number of iterations, and for each iteration, it reads another integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). Based on the value of `n`, it constructs and prints a three-letter word. If `n` is greater than 52, the word is formed by appending 'zz' to the `n - 53`-th letter of the alphabet. If `n` is between 27 and 52, the word is formed by appending 'z' to the `n - 28`-th letter of the alphabet, with 'a' as the first letter. If `n` is between 3 and 26, the word is formed by appending the `n - 3`-th letter of the alphabet, with 'aa' as the first two letters. After the loop completes, the `word` variable is reset to an empty string for each iteration, and the `alphabet` variable remains unchanged. **
