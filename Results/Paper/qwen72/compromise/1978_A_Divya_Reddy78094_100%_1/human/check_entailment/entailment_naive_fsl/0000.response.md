Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the maximum number of pages in the list is the same for multiple books. In such a case, the program will always place the last occurrence of the maximum number in one pile and the second-to-last occurrence in the other pile, which may not always yield the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
2 2 3 2 2
```
The correct output should be `5` (by placing the two books with 3 pages in different piles), but the program will output `4` because it only considers the last two books in the list, which have 2 pages each.
