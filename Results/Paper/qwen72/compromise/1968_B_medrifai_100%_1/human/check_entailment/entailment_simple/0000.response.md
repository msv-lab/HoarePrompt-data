### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `i`, `j`, and `c` are initialized to 0. 
     - `i` is the index for string `a`.
     - `j` is the index for string `b`.
     - `c` is the count of the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **While Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m` and `i` is less than `n`.
   - Inside the loop, `func_1` is called to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j`), it means `a[i]` is found in `b` starting from `j`. The program then updates `j` to `new_j + 1` (to move past the found character in `b`), increments `i` to check the next character in `a`, and increments `c` to count the matched character.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it means `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from `j`, and the loop breaks.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` searches for the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the character in the original string `b` (i.e., `j + index`).
   - If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic in the while loop ensures that the program checks each character of `a` to see if it can be found in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
- The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b`, and it correctly returns the appropriate index or `-1` if the character is not found.
- The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a character in `a` that cannot be matched in `b`, which is the correct behavior for determining the maximum prefix length.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
