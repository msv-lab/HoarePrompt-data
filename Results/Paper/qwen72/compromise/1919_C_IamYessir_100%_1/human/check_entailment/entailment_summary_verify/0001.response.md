### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized.
   - The penalty `p(b)` for an array `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` between 1 and `m-1` where `b_i < b_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `lit` itself.
   - It initializes two empty lists `a` and `b` to store the subsequences and a variable `cp` (which is not used in the program).
   - It then iterates through the array `lit` and decides which subsequence to append each element to based on the comparison of the last elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Logic for Splitting the Array:**
   - The program uses a series of `if` conditions to decide where to append the current element `lit[i]`:
     - If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`.
     - If `b` is empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`.
     - If `x > y`, the element is appended to `b` if `y >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > x`.
     - If `x == y`, the element is appended to `a`.
     - If `x < y`, the element is appended to `a` if `x >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > y`.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the element is appended to `b`.

4. **Calculating the Penalty:**
   - After the array is split, the program calculates the penalty for each subsequence `a` and `b` by counting the number of increasing pairs.
   - The total penalty `s` is the sum of the penalties of `a` and `b`.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Complex and Inconsistent Logic:** The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are overly complex and not consistent. For example, the condition `if x > y` and `elif x < y` are symmetric, but the conditions inside them are not. This can lead to suboptimal splits.
   - **Handling Empty Lists:** The program correctly handles the case where `a` or `b` is empty by setting `x` or `y` to `float('inf')`, but the logic for appending elements when one of the lists is empty is not optimal.
   - **Suboptimal Splitting:** The program does not ensure that the subsequences `a` and `b` are non-decreasing, which is a key requirement to minimize the penalty. Instead, it uses a complex set of conditions that do not guarantee the optimal split.

6. **Optimal Solution:**
   - The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to ensure that no increasing pairs are formed in either subsequence.
   - This can be achieved by sorting the array and then splitting it into two non-decreasing subsequences. The penalty for a non-decreasing subsequence is always 0.
   - However, the program does not sort the array or ensure that the subsequences are non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for splitting the array and calculating the penalty is flawed and does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
