Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list, `b` is a list that now includes the integer `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is now the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, and `x` is less than `y`. Additionally, `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
