Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the conditions in the loop, `s` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `n` is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.
- The list `lit` remains the list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `cp` remains 0.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- The lists `a` and `b` contain elements from `lit` based on the conditions specified in the loop.
- The variable `s` remains 0.
- The variable `x` is updated to the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty; otherwise, it remains positive infinity.
- The variable `y` is updated to the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, it remains positive infinity.
