Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If the length of `a` is greater than 0, `x` is set to the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, so the last element of `a` is now `lit[i]` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. The state of `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`.
- This means the last element of `a` is now `lit[i]`.
- Since `x` is set to the last element of `a` if the length of `a` is greater than 0, `x` is now `lit[i]`.
- The state of `b` remains unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.
