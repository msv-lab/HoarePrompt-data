Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists where each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the element before it, and each element in `b` is greater than or equal to the element before it, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it plus the number of times an element in `b` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` remains at least 2.
- The variable `i` is now `len(b) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `b`.
- The lists `a` and `b` still maintain their properties where each element is greater than or equal to the element before it.
- The variable `x` is still the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise it is positive infinity.
- The variable `y` is still the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise it is positive infinity.
- The variable `s` now represents the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it and the number of times an element in `b` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it.
