Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list that now includes the third element of `lit` as its last element, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is the third element of `lit`), `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
