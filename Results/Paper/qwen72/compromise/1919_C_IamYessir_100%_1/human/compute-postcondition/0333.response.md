Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists where each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the element before it, and each element in `b` is greater than or equal to the element before it. `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. `s` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**
