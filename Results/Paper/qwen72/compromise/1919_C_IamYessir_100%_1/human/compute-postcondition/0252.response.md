Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.**
