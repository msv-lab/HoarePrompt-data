Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, the value `lit[1]` is appended to the list `b`. If `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, the list `b` now contains the second element of `lit` as its last element. If `lit[1]` is not greater than `x` but is greater than `y`, then `a` has one more element appended from `lit[1]` and `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If neither condition is met, the lists `a` and `b`, and the variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged.***
