Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list that now includes the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[0]`), `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `s` is 0, `x` is greater than `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
