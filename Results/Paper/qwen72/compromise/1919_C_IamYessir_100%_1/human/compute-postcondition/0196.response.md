Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to its end. If `b` is not empty, `y` is set to the last element of list `b` (which is now `lit[2]`). If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`.**
