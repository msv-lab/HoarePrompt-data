The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If `lit` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is not modified.**
