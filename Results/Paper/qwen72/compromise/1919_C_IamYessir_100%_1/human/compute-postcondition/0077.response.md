Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is a list containing the third element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[2]`), `a` is an empty list or a list of integers, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` which is now `lit[2]`.**
