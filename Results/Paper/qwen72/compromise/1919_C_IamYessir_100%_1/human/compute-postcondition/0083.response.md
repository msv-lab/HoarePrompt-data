Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`), `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**

The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index 2 of the list `lit` to the list `a`. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[2]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
