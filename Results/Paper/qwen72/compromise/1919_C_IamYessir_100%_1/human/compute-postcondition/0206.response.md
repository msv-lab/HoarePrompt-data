Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, `a` contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `x` is set to the last element of the updated list `a`. If `lit[2]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, `b` contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it.***
