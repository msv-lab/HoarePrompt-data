Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with `lit[0]` appended to it, `b` is a list, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[0]`), `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `s` is 0, `x` is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 0, `lit[0]` is appended to `a`.
- The value of `x` is now the last element of `a`, which is `lit[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
