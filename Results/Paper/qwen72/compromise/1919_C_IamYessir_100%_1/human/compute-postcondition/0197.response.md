Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with the element `lit[2]` appended to it, `b` is a list, `s` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `2` of the list `lit` to the list `a`.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `lit[2]` is appended to `a`.
- The initial state indicates that `a` and `b` are lists, and their contents are not specified. After the code execution, `a` now contains the element `lit[2]`.
- The initial state also specifies that if `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. This condition remains unchanged.
- Similarly, if `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. Since `a` now contains `lit[2]`, `x` is set to `lit[2]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `cp`, `s`) remain unchanged.
