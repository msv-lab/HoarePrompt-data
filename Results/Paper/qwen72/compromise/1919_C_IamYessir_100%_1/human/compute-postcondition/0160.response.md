Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `s` is 0, and `x` is less than `y`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now includes `lit[0]` as its last element, `x` is updated to `lit[0]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `x` is less than `y`. If neither of these conditions is met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
