Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with the second element of `lit` appended to it, `b` is a list, `s` is 0. If `a` was initially an empty list, `x` is now the second element of `lit`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`.**
