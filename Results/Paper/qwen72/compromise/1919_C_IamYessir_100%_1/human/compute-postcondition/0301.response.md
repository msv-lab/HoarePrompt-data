Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If `lit[i] > y`, `a` has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `b` remains unchanged, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[i]`), and `y` remains the same (infinity if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0). Otherwise, if the length of `a` is greater than 0, `x` is set to the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `y` is now the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]`). If `y < lit[i]`, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]` if `y < lit[i]`). If `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it; otherwise, if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is now greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, `a` has one more element, which is `lit[0]` if `x == y`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` and `y` remains the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it. If `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y` but `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, the state of `b` remains unchanged.**
