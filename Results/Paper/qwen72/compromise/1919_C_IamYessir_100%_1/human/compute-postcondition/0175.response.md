Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, then `a` has one more element appended from `lit[1]` and `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `a` is no longer empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If the condition is not met, the lists `a` and `b`, and the variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged.***
