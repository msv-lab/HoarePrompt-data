Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x > y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` as its last element. If `x > y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list. If `x > y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, and `x` equals `y`, then `a` is no longer an empty list, and `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`). If `x <= y`, and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list. If `x <= y`, and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, `b` is no longer an empty list, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list.**
