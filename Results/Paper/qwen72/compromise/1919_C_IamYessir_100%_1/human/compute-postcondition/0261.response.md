Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[i]` if the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is true). If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. `y` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, and `a` has one more element, which is `lit[i]`.***
