The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`.

Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- The value of `lit[i]` is added to the list `b`.
- The value of `y` is updated to be the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[i]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, `x`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is a list.
- `b` is a list.
- `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.
- `s` is 0.
- `y` is less than `lit[i]`.
- `x` is greater than `y`.
- `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.

After executing the code:
- `b` now contains the element `lit[i]`.
- `y` is now equal to `lit[i]`.

The updated conditions are:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is a list.
- `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]`.
- `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is now equal to `lit[i]`.
- `s` is 0.
- `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]`, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
