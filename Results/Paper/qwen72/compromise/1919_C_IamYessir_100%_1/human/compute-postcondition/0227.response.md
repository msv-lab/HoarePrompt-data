Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the conditions in the loop, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element, `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty, `b` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.***
