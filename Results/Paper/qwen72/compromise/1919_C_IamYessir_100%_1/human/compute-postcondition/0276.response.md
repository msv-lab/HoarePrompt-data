Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `x` is less than `y`, `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 0, the first element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[0]`) is appended to `b`.
- The conditions `x < y`, `x != y`, `x < lit[i]`, `lit[i] <= y`, `y >= lit[i]`, and `lit[i] > x` remain unchanged.
- The length of `b` is now greater than 0, and the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`.
- The value of `n` and `i` remain the same.
- The value of `x` and `y` also remain the same, but `y` is now the last element of the updated list `b`.
