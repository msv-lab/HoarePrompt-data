Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in k excursions. The key points to consider are:
1. The total number of possible pairs of children is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
2. The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \).
3. If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
4. The expected value of the sum of friendship values can be calculated by considering the contribution of each friend pair over k excursions.

The program does the following:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It calculates the modular inverse `c` of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- It initializes `a` to store the sum of initial friendship values.
- It reads `m` lines of input, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adds these values to `a`.
- It initializes `s` to store the sum of expected friendship values over k excursions.
- It iterates over k excursions, updating `s` by adding the expected value of the friendship value for each excursion.
- The expected value for each excursion is calculated as \( c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \), where `i` is the current excursion index.
- Finally, it prints the result `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, there is a mistake in the expected value calculation. The expected value for each excursion should be:
- The probability of choosing a friend pair is \( \frac{m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \).
- The expected value of the friendship value for a chosen pair in the i-th excursion is \( \frac{a + i \times m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \).

The current formula in the loop:
```python
s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```
is incorrect. It should be:
```python
s = s + (a + i * m) * c
```

This correction ensures that the expected value is calculated correctly for each excursion.

Correctness: **False**
