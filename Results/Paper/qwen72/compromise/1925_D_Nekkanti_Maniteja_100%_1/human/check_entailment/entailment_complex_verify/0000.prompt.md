You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. The variable `s` is the final result of the loop, which is the sum of all calculated values modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The variable `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input. The variable `c` is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of nodes `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a threshold `k`. It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `u`, `v`, and `f`, and calculates a final result `s` based on these inputs. The result `s` is the sum of a specific formula applied `k` times, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function prints the result `s` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated for each test case, and `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input for each test case, while `c` is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum `s` in the loop is incorrect. The program incorrectly calculates the expected value by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s` for each excursion, which does not accurately reflect the problem description.

The correct approach should involve calculating the expected value of the friendship value for each pair chosen, considering the increase in friendship value for each subsequent choice. The expected value for each pair being chosen in a single excursion is `c * m` (where `c` is the probability of choosing a pair of friends, and `m` is the number of friend pairs), and the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair chosen is `c * (a + i)` (where `a` is the initial sum of friendship values, and `i` is the current excursion number).

A correct implementation should update the expected sum `s` as follows:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i)) % M
        print(s % M)
```

This ensures that the expected value of the sum of friendship values is correctly calculated for each excursion. The original program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for some test cases. For example, in the case where `n = 3`, `m = 1`, and `k = 2` with the initial friendship value of the single pair being 1, the program will produce an incorrect result.
