### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in competitive programming to avoid large numbers and ensure results fit within standard integer ranges.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the total number of pairs is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` of all pairs of friends.
   - This is done by reading `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adding these values to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program then iterates over `k` excursions and calculates the expected sum of friendship values.
   - For each excursion, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the increase in the friendship value of pairs chosen in previous excursions.
     - `c * a` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs.
   - However, there is a mistake in the formula used to update `s`. The term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship value due to previous excursions. The correct term should be `c * a * i` to account for the cumulative increase in friendship values.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that all intermediate results and the final result are within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The final result is printed as `s % M`.

5. **Efficiency and Constraints:**
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints by using modular inverse and modular arithmetic, which are necessary for large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The time complexity is \(O(m + k)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula used to update `s` is incorrect. The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion should be `c * a * i + c * a` instead of `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - The term `c * a * i` correctly accounts for the cumulative increase in friendship values due to previous excursions, while `c * a` accounts for the initial friendship values.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the formula used to update the expected sum of friendship values. The term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect and should be `c * a * i` to correctly account for the cumulative increase in friendship values.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
