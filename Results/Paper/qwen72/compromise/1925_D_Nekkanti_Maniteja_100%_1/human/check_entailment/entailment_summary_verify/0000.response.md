### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Description:
- We have `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions.
- Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
- For each excursion, a pair of children is chosen randomly.
- If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- It sums the initial friendship values `a` from the `m` pairs.
- It then iterates `k` times, updating `s` with a formula that includes `c`, `i`, `m`, and `a`.
- Finally, it prints `s % M` for each test case.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct because this represents the probability of choosing any specific pair of children from the total possible pairs.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` from the `m` pairs.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program updates `s` in the loop with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - This formula is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` does not make sense in the context of the problem. The expected value for each pair being chosen in a single excursion should be `c * (a + i)`, where `c` is the probability of choosing a pair of friends, `a` is the initial sum of friendship values, and `i` is the current excursion number.

#### Correct Approach:
- The expected value for each pair being chosen in a single excursion is `c * (a + i)`.
- The total expected value `s` should be the sum of these expected values over all `k` excursions.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i)) % M
        print(s % M)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect and should be `s = (s + c * (a + i)) % M`.

Final: **False**
