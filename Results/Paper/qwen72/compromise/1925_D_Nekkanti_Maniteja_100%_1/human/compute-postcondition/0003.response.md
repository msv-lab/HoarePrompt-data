Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of nodes `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a threshold `k`. It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `u`, `v`, and `f`, and calculates a final result `s` based on these inputs. The result `s` is the sum of a specific formula applied `k` times, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function prints the result `s` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated for each test case, and `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input for each test case, while `c` is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). **
