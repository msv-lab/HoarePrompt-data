Output State: **The value of `t` is unchanged. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. The variable `s` is the final result of the loop, which is the sum of all calculated values modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The variable `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input. The variable `c` is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**
