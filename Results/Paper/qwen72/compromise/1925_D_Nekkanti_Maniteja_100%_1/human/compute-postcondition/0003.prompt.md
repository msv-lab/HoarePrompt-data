You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each of the m lines, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. The variable `s` is the final result of the loop, which is the sum of all calculated values modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The variable `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input. The variable `c` is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple parameters including the number of test cases `t`, the number of nodes `n`, the number of edges `m`, a threshold `k`, and a list of edges. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the constraints and relationships provided, handling multiple test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
