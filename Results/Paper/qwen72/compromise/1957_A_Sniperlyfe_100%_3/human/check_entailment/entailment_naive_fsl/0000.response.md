Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of polygons with different numbers of sides. The function `func_1` only considers polygons with 3 sides (triangles) by using `v // 3` to determine the number of polygons that can be formed. However, the problem description allows for the construction of regular polygons with any number of sides (as long as the number of sides is 3 or more). For example, in the test case where `arr = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will output `1` (since it only counts the square formed by the four 3s), but the correct output should be `1` for the square and `0` for any triangles, as the problem description allows for polygons with more than 3 sides. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
