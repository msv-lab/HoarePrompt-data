Reasoning:  
The given program aims to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from a list of stick lengths. The logic implemented in the `func_1` function counts the frequency of each stick length and then divides each frequency by 3 to determine how many polygons can be formed with that stick length. However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that each polygon must have 3 sides (i.e., it only considers triangles). The problem statement does not restrict the polygons to triangles; it can be any regular polygon with 3 or more sides.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the frequency of each stick length.
2. For each stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency by the smallest possible number of sides (3) and then by the next possible number of sides (4, 5, etc.), up to the frequency itself.
3. Sum the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length.

The current implementation only considers triangles, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
