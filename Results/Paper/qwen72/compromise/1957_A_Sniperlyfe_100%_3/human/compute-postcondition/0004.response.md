Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. Each value in `freq` represents the frequency of an integer in the list `arr`.**

In simpler terms, the program calculates how many times each integer in `arr` appears, divides each of these counts by 3 (using integer division), and then returns the sum of these divisions.
