#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: a list of integers `numbers` representing the numbers on the cards, an integer `n` representing the number of cards, and an integer `k` representing the number of cards to be exchanged in each operation. The input should be such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and each element in `numbers` should satisfy 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop completes, and the loop prints `k - 1` for each iteration. The variables `n`, `k`, and `l` are updated in each iteration based on the input provided during that iteration. The list `l` and the integer `n` are not used within the loop body, so their values are not relevant to the output state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value. The variables `n` and `l` (the list of integers) are read but not used in the function's operations.
