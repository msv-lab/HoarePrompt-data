The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input integer `t`, so we can only adjust those.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point for the `range(t)` function.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
