Output State: **ntest is an input integer, t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ntest` remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 500, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` is re-assigned in each iteration of the loop, but after the loop finishes, it will be the last value read from the input, which is still within the range 2 to 100.
- The variable `a` is re-assigned in each iteration of the loop, but after the loop finishes, it will be the last list of integers read from the input, which is still a list of `n` integers where each integer is within the range 1 to 10^9. The list `a` is also sorted in each iteration, but the final state of `a` will be the last sorted list read from the input.
