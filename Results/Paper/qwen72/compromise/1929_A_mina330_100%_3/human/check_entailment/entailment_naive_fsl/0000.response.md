Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, this approach does not account for the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is required to maximize the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be 2, as the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]` and the beauty is calculated as:
```
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2
```
However, the provided program will output:
```
3 - 1 = 2
```
This is incorrect because the program is not summing the differences between consecutive elements but rather just computing the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```
This version correctly computes the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
