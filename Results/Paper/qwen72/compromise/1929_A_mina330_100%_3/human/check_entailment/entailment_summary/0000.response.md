Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the elements in any order. The beauty is calculated as \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, and the beauty is maximized by the largest possible positive differences.

However, the program provided does not calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Instead, it calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, which is not the correct approach to find the maximum beauty.

The correct approach to find the maximum beauty would be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The provided program only prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
