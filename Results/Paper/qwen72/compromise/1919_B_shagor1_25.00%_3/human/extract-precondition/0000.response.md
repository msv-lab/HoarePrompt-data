Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". For each test case, `1 <= t <= 1000` and `1 <= n <= 5000`.**

However, based on the provided function definition `def func_1():`, it seems there is a mismatch. The function should be designed to accept the inputs as described in the problem. If we assume the function definition is to be corrected, the precondition would be as stated above. If the function is intended to be used without parameters, then it does not align with the problem description, and a precondition cannot be accurately determined without additional context.
