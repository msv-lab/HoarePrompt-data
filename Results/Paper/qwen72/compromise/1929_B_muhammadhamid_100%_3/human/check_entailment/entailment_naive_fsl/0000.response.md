Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \) correctly. According to the problem description, if \( k \) is \( 4n - 2 \), all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals must have at least one colored cell. However, the program does not account for this specific edge case.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 10
```
The program will output:
```
5
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
6
```
This is because a 3x3 grid has 10 diagonals, and to ensure that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell, you need to color 6 cells, as shown in the example provided in the problem description. The program's logic fails to handle this case correctly.
