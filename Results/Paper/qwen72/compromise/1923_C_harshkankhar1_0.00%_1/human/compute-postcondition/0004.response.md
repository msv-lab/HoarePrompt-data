Output State: `n` remains the same input integer, `q` remains the same input integer, `a` remains the same list of length `n + 1` with the first element `0` and subsequent elements as the integers provided in the input, `c` remains the same list of positive integers, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is `0` and for each `i` from `1` to `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `1` or not, respectively.
