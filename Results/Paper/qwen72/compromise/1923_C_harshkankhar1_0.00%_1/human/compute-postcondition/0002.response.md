Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers provided in the input, `c` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `0`.**

The initial state remains unchanged, but a new list `b` is created with a length of `n + 1`, and all elements in `b` are initialized to `0`.
