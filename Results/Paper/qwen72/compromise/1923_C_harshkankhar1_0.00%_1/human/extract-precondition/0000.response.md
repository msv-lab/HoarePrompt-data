Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The array `c` is a list of positive integers, and the number of queries `q` is a non-negative integer. Each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the array `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed `3 * 10^5`.**

Given the function definition is not provided correctly, here is a more appropriate function definition based on the problem description:

```python
def is_good_subarray(c, queries):
```

Precondition: **c is a list of positive integers, and queries is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= len(c)`. The length of `c` and the number of queries `q` are both non-negative integers not exceeding `3 * 10^5`. The sum of the lengths of all arrays `c` and the sum of all `q` over all test cases do not exceed `3 * 10^5`.**
