Reasoning:

1. **Cumulative Sum Array `a`**: The program correctly builds a cumulative sum array `a` using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module. This array is used to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray of the original array `c` (renamed to `a` in the program).

2. **Cumulative Sum Array `b`**: The program also builds a cumulative sum array `b` where each element is 1 if the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1, and 2 otherwise. This is done to ensure that the sum of `b` is always greater than or equal to the sum of `a` for the subarray to be considered "good".

3. **Query Processing**: For each query `(x, y)`, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[x:y]` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b[x:y]` and if `x != y`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where `x == y`, which means the subarray has only one element. In this case, it is impossible to find a `b` such that `a_i \neq b_i` for every index `i` in the subarray, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.

5. **Input and Output**: The program reads the input as specified and prints the output in the correct format. It processes multiple test cases as required.

6. **Efficiency**: The program efficiently computes the cumulative sums and processes the queries in linear time, which is suitable given the constraints.

However, there is a minor issue in the program:

- **Incorrect Output of `a`**: The line `print(*a)` is not necessary and should be removed. It prints the cumulative sum array `a` after it has been processed, which is not part of the required output. This line should be removed to ensure the program only outputs the results of the queries.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct except for the unnecessary `print(*a)` statement.

Correctness: **False**

The program should be modified to remove the `print(*a)` statement. Here is the corrected version:

```python
from itertools import accumulate

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

With this correction, the program will be correct.
