Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The array `c` is a list of positive integers, and the number of queries `q` is a non-negative integer. Each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the array `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` starting from `b[0] = 0`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 1 3 6 10 (where the values are the cumulative sums of the original values of list `a`)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of its original values, `c` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` starting from `b[0] = 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes an array `a` of positive integers and a number of queries `q`. It computes a cumulative sum array `b` based on the condition that each element in `a` is either 1 or 2 (1 if the element is greater than 1, otherwise 2). It then modifies `a` to be its own cumulative sum array. For each query `(x, y)`, the function prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b[x:y]` and `x != y`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original values, and `b` is a list of cumulative sums based on the condition `a[i] > 1`.
