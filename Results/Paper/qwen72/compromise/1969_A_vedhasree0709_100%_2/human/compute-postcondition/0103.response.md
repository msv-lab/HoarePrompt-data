The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000), an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` (1 <= p_i <= n) is not equal to its index `i`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
