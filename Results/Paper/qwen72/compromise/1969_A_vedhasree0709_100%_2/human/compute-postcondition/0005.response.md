The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. Since `i` is 0, the condition `i <= n - 1` will always be true as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
