Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `_` is incremented by 1 (though the initial value of `_` is not provided, this increment operation does not affect the `print` statement).
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `p` is the element at index 3 in `l`.
- `q` is the element at the index `p - 1` in `l`.
- `j` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `2`.
- None of the variables or objects described in the initial state are used in the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
