The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `p` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
