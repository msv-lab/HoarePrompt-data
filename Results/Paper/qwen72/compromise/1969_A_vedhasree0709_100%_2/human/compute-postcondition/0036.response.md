The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`.

- `l` is updated to be a list of integers from the input.
- The initial state specifies that `l` is a list of integers from the input, so this part of the state is now more specific.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is n, `j` is 0 if the condition `l[l[i-1] - 1] == i` was not true for any `i` between 1 and n, otherwise `j` is 1, and `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
