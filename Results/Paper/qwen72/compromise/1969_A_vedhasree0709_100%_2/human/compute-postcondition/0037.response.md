Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is 0, `j` is 0 if the condition `l[l[i-1] - 1] == i` was not true for any `i` between 1 and n, otherwise `j` is 1, and `l` is a list of integers from the input.**

The variable `i` is updated to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `j`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
