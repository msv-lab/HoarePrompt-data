The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should remain 2 or be incremented, and `n` should be greater than 2.

Since `i` is 2, and we need `i <= n - 1` to be true for the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `p` is now equal to the value at index 1 of `l`, `q` is now equal to the integer at the index `p - 1` in the list `l`. If `q` == 2, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
