Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed in certain scenarios. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3
2
```

Actual Output:
```
2
2
2
```

The program incorrectly outputs `2` for the second test case, where the correct answer is `3`. The issue arises because the program only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and immediately prints `2` when it finds such a pair, without considering if sending invitations to three friends might be necessary to ensure at least two friends attend the party. This logic is flawed and does not cover all possible scenarios.
