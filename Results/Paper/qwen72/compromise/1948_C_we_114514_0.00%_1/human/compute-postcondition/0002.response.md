Output State: `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`, indicating whether it is possible to reach the second row from the first row in the grid for that test case. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `test_cases`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
