Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function evaluates whether it is possible to navigate from the start of the first row to the end of the second row based on the arrow directions. It returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating the possibility of such navigation. **
