### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array `a` by performing operations that set a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a subarray `a[l:r]` is the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.
   - The program should ensure that the MEX is correctly identified and applied to the subarray.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function handles the case where the subarray `a[l:r]` is being processed.
     - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If not, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets the entire subarray `a[l:r]` to `r - l + 1` and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - **Issue**: The function does not correctly identify the MEX. It assumes that the MEX is always `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily true. The MEX could be any integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not present in the subarray.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - **Issue**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing `ops` as an argument, which leads to an error because `ops` is used inside `recursive_maximize_sum`.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function calculates the sum of the subarray `a[l:r]` and compares it to the maximum possible sum of the subarray, which is `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If the current sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position, then recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum value.
     - **Issue**: The function does not correctly identify the MEX. It assumes that the MEX is always `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily true. The MEX could be any integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not present in the subarray.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the results.
     - **Issue**: The function `func_2` is called without passing `ops` as an argument, which leads to an error because `ops` is used inside `recursive_maximize_sum`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not correctly identify the MEX for a subarray.
   - The recursive approach is flawed because it assumes the MEX is always `r - l + 1`, which is incorrect.
   - The number of operations is not guaranteed to be within the limit of 5 * 10^5 due to the incorrect MEX calculation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the subarray length is 1 by setting the element to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - However, it does not handle the general case correctly due to the incorrect MEX calculation.

6. **Optimization**:
   - The recursive approach is not optimized for the correct MEX calculation, leading to potential inefficiencies and incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem because it incorrectly identifies the MEX for subarrays and does not pass the `ops` list correctly to the recursive functions. The constraints are not respected, and the operations are not applied efficiently.

Final: **False**
