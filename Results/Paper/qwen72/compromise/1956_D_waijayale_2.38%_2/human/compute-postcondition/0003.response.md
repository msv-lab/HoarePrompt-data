To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.
     - `s` is the first value returned.
     - `m` is the second value returned.
     - `ops` is the third value returned.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s, m)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the values of `s` and `m` as returned by `func_2(a)`.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_2(a)` is not provided, we can only describe the values of `s` and `m` based on the information given.

4. **Explanation:**
   - `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`.
   - `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`.

Given the lack of specific details about the function `func_2(a)`, we can only describe the output in terms of the values returned by this function.

Output: **s, m (where s is the first value returned by func_2(a) and m is the second value returned by func_2(a))**
