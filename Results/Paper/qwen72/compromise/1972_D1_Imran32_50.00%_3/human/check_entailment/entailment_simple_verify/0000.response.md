### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should take two parameters `n` and `m` as per the problem description.
   - Inside `func_1`, the input is read using `n, k = map(int, input().split())`, but the variable `k` is not used anywhere in the function. This suggests a mismatch between the intended problem and the implemented solution.

2. **Logic for Calculating Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is incorrect for the given problem. The correct initialization should be `ans = 0` because we are counting pairs, and initially, there are no pairs.
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `root + 1`, where `root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This loop is not relevant to the problem of finding pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - Inside the loop, `cnt` is set to `i * i`, and `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt`. This calculation does not align with the problem's requirements. It seems to be a different algorithm altogether.

3. **Correct Algorithm:**
   - The correct approach to solve the problem involves iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The program does not implement this logic. Instead, it performs a loop that calculates a sum based on `i * i`, which is unrelated to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The function `func_1` is not correctly defined, and the logic inside the function does not match the problem description.

Final: **False**
