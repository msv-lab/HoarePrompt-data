You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:

- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The function should be able to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing the integers n, m, and k.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and for each test case, the output will be either 'NO' or 'Yes' based on the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` will retain their final values from the last iteration, and the loop index `itest` will be equal to `t`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot win.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that will have the same color if the colors are distributed as evenly as possible.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - If `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:
     - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The condition `n <= k` is correct because if Bob can repaint all parts, he will always win.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is correct because it ensures that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, `k = 1`, and `m = 1`, the code correctly prints 'NO'.
   - For `n = 5`, `k = 1`, and `m = 2`, the code correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting only one part.
   - For `n = 5`, `k = 2`, and `m = 2`, the code correctly prints 'NO' because Bob can always repaint two parts to make all parts the same color.
   - For `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and `m = 5`, the code correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting only three parts.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and logic are sound and cover all the necessary cases.
