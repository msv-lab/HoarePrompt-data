### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot win.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that will have the same color if the colors are distributed as evenly as possible.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - If `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:
     - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The condition `n <= k` is correct because if Bob can repaint all parts, he will always win.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is correct because it ensures that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, `k = 1`, and `m = 1`, the code correctly prints 'NO'.
   - For `n = 5`, `k = 1`, and `m = 2`, the code correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting only one part.
   - For `n = 5`, `k = 2`, and `m = 2`, the code correctly prints 'NO' because Bob can always repaint two parts to make all parts the same color.
   - For `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and `m = 5`, the code correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting only three parts.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and logic are sound and cover all the necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
