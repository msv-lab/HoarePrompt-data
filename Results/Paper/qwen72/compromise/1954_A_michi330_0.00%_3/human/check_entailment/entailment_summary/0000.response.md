Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's break down the problem and the logic of the program.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Input:** 
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case, three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`:
    - `n`: Number of parts of the ribbon.
    - `m`: Number of colors available.
    - `k`: Number of parts Bob can repaint.
- **Output:** 
  - For each test case, print 'YES' if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Program Logic:
1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Conditions for 'NO':**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Hence, the answer is 'NO'.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition is more complex. It checks if the number of parts that are not the most frequent color (i.e., `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Hence, the answer is 'NO'.

3. **Conditions for 'YES':**
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'Yes'.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1 (`n <= k`):**
  - This condition is straightforward. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
  
- **Condition 2 (`n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`):**
  - This condition is based on the idea that if Alice paints the ribbon in such a way that the most frequent color appears `math.ceil(n / m)` times, then the remaining parts (i.e., `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) are the parts that are not the most frequent color.
  - If the number of these non-most-frequent parts is less than `k`, Bob can repaint all of them to the most frequent color, making all parts the same color. Hence, the answer is 'NO'.
  - If the number of non-most-frequent parts is greater than or equal to `k`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Hence, the answer is 'YES'.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
  - Since `n <= k` is true, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct.
  
- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `5 1 1`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
  - Since `m = 1`, Alice can only use one color. Bob can repaint one part, but he can't change all parts to a different color because there is only one color. The program prints 'NO'. This is correct.
  
- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 2 1`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
  - `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3` (most frequent color can appear 3 times).
  - `n - 3 = 2` (remaining parts).
  - Since `2 >= 1`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. The program prints 'YES'. This is correct.
  
- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `5 2 2`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3` (most frequent color can appear 3 times).
  - `n - 3 = 2` (remaining parts).
  - Since `2 < 2`, Bob can repaint the remaining parts to the most frequent color. The program prints 'NO'. This is correct.
  
- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `5 5 3`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
  - `math.ceil(5 / 5) = 1` (most frequent color can appear 1 time).
  - `n - 1 = 4` (remaining parts).
  - Since `4 >= 3`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. The program prints 'YES'. This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The conditions and the logic are sound and match the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
