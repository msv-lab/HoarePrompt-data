The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and according to the precondition, `t` should be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 representing the number of test cases.**
