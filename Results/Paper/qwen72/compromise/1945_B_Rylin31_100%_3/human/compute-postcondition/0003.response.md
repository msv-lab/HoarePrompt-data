The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `m` ≤ 10^18. The function also involves an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, which likely represents the number of test cases.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to process each test case and produce an output based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18 and returns a result based on these inputs.**
