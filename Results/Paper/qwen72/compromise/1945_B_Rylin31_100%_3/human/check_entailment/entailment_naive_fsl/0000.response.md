Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The formula used in the program `m // a + m // b + 2` does not accurately represent the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6 7 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

The program incorrectly adds 2 to the result, which is not always the correct adjustment. The correct approach should consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations. The correct formula to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should account for the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and the visibility period `m`.

For example, in the case of `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2, as explained in the problem description. The program, however, outputs 3, which is incorrect.
