You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the user input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 78`. It then constructs and prints a string based on the value of `n`:
- If `n > 52`, the string is formed by appending the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz'.
- If `26 < n ≤ 52`, the string is formed by appending 'a', the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet, and 'z'.
- If `3 ≤ n ≤ 26`, the string is formed by appending 'aa' and the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.
The function does not return any value; it only prints the constructed strings to the console. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged, and the variables `t` and `n` are not modified after their initial assignment.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that sums up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal `n`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
   - The output should be the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for each test case.

3. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program uses a predefined string `alphabet` which contains all lowercase Latin letters.
   - It processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.
   - Depending on the value of `n`, it constructs the word:
     - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - If `n > 26`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - If `n ≤ 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

4. **Verification of the Approach**:
   - **Case 1: n > 52**:
     - The maximum sum of two letters is 26 + 26 = 52.
     - If `n > 52`, the third letter must be 'z' (26) and the second letter must also be 'z' (26).
     - The first letter is then `alphabet[n - 53]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first letter is the smallest possible, and the other two are 'z'.

   - **Case 2: 26 < n ≤ 52**:
     - The maximum sum of one letter is 26.
     - If `n > 26`, the third letter must be 'z' (26).
     - The first letter is 'a' (1), and the second letter is `alphabet[n - 28]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first letter is 'a', and the second letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.

   - **Case 3: n ≤ 26**:
     - If `n ≤ 26`, the word can be constructed with the first two letters as 'a' (1 + 1 = 2).
     - The third letter is `alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
     - For `n = 78`, the word is 'zzz' (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each given `n` based on the logic described.
   - The logic covers all possible ranges of `n` and ensures the smallest possible letters are used.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
