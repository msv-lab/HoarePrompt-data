Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the encoded word. This matches the problem description.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**: The program initializes the `alphabet` variable with all lowercase Latin letters, which is correct and necessary for mapping the indices to letters.

3. **Word Construction**:
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**:
     - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to `n - 53` followed by "zz".
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of the indices for a word "zzz" is 78 (26 + 26 + 26), and the smallest possible word for `n > 52` would be the smallest letter that, when combined with "zz", equals `n`. For example, if `n = 70`, the smallest letter is "r" (18), so the word is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).
   - **Case 2: `n > 26`**:
     - If `n` is between 27 and 52, the program constructs the word by adding "a" followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 28` and then "z".
     - This is correct because the smallest possible word for `n > 26` would be the smallest letter that, when combined with "az", equals `n`. For example, if `n = 55`, the smallest letter is "c" (3), so the word is "czz" (1 + 3 + 26 = 55).
   - **Case 3: `n <= 26`**:
     - If `n` is between 3 and 26, the program constructs the word by adding "aa" followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.
     - This is correct because the smallest possible word for `n <= 26` would be the smallest letter that, when combined with "aa", equals `n`. For example, if `n = 3`, the smallest letter is "a" (1), so the word is "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).

4. **Output**: The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n = 3`, the smallest word is "aaa", and when `n = 78`, the smallest word is "zzz".

6. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by always starting with the smallest possible letters and only using larger letters when necessary to meet the sum `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
