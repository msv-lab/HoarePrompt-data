Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the user input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 78`. It then constructs and prints a string based on the value of `n`:
- If `n > 52`, the string is formed by appending the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz'.
- If `26 < n ≤ 52`, the string is formed by appending 'a', the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet, and 'z'.
- If `3 ≤ n ≤ 26`, the string is formed by appending 'aa' and the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.
The function does not return any value; it only prints the constructed strings to the console. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged, and the variables `t` and `n` are not modified after their initial assignment. **
