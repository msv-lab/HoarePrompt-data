Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of the number of sticks and a list of exponents representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates the number of ways to form triangles using the sticks for each test case and prints these results to the console. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the `results` list to store the calculated values. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
