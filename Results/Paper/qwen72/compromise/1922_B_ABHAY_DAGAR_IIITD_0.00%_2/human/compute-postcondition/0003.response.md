The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `results` list contains the calculated number of ways to form triangles for each test case, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute unless the list is non-empty. Therefore, the `results` list must have at least one element for the loop to execute, and `result` will be the first element in the `results` list.

State: **`results` is a list that must have at least one element, `result` is the first element in the `results` list, `test_cases` list remains unchanged**
