You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is a correct approach to efficiently count the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program iterates over the counts of each stick length and calculates the number of ways to form triangles.
   - **Case 1: All three sticks have the same length (`cnt >= 3`):**
     - The formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length. This is the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \).
   - **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length (`cnt >= 2`):**
     - The formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length and one stick from the previously counted sticks (`total_count`). This is the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \) multiplied by the number of previously counted sticks.
   - **Updating Total Count:**
     - The program correctly updates `total_count` with the count of the current stick length.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result of each test case to the `results` list and prints the results after processing all test cases.

### Verification with Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `7`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - All sticks have the same length.
  - Number of ways to choose 3 sticks: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - Output: `35` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4`, `3 2 1 3`
  - Stick lengths: 8, 4, 2, 8
  - Possible triangles: (8, 4, 8) and (8, 2, 8)
  - Number of ways to choose 3 sticks: 2
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
  - Stick lengths: 2, 4, 8
  - No possible triangles can be formed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1`, `1`
  - Only one stick.
  - No possible triangles can be formed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, counts the stick lengths, and calculates the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles. The logic and formulas used are correct and match the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
