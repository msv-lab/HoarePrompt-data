Output State: **`left` and `right` remain non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` remains a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`. The elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`.**
