Functionality: ** The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function modifies two external arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right` are set to a sequence of values starting from `left + 1` and increasing to `left + mid` (where `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`), followed by a sequence of values starting from `right + 1` and decreasing to `right + 1 - (right - left + 1 - mid)`. The elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are all set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value. **
