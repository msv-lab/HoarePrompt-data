Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer input such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^3, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is still the same integer input it was initially, within the range 1 to 10^3.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `mak` is updated to the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution. If the user never input `<`, `mak` remains 0.
