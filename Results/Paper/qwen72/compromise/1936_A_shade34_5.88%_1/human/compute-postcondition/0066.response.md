Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the input string is '>', `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the input string. If the input string is '>', `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.
   - Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `mak` or the input string, we need to consider both cases:
     - **Case 1: Input string is '>'**
       - `mak` is 2.
     - **Case 2: Input string is not '>'**
       - `mak` remains unchanged, and we don't know its initial value.

4. **Determine the Values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`:**
   - `pans[mak]` will be the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`.
   - `pans[i]` will be the element at index `i` in the list `pans`, and since `i` is 3, it will be the element at index 3 in the list `pans`.

5. **Output for Each Case:**
   - **Case 1: Input string is '>'**
     - `mak` is 2.
     - The print statement will be:
       ```python
       print('?', pans[2], pans[2], pans[3], pans[3])
       ```
     - This will print the string '?', followed by the element at index 2 of `pans` twice, and the element at index 3 of `pans` twice.
     - Output: **? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[2] is the element at index 2 of the list pans and pans[3] is the element at index 3 of the list pans)**

   - **Case 2: Input string is not '>'**
     - The value of `mak` is unknown.
     - The print statement will be:
       ```python
       print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[3], pans[3])
       ```
     - This will print the string '?', followed by the element at index `mak` of `pans` twice, and the element at index 3 of `pans` twice.
     - Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[mak] is the element at index mak of the list pans and pans[3] is the element at index 3 of the list pans)**

Since the initial state does not specify the input string or the initial value of `mak`, we need to consider both cases. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[mak] is the element at index mak of the list pans and pans[3] is the element at index 3 of the list pans)**

If the input string is known to be '>', then the output would be more specific:

Output: **? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[2] is the element at index 2 of the list pans and pans[3] is the element at index 3 of the list pans)**
