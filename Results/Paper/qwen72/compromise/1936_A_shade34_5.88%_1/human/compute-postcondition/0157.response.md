Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` is set to 1.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It only ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which is already part of the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
