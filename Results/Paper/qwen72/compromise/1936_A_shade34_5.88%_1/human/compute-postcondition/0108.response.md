Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`pans`**: This is either an empty list or a list containing `[0]` if `s` is equal to `=`.
2. **`i`**: This is set to 1.
3. **`mak`**: This is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations.
4. **`n`**: This is an input integer greater than 1.
5. **`mak2`**: This is equal to `mak`.
6. **`s`**: This is the user input string.
7. **Condition**: If `s` is `<`, then `pans` is a list containing `[0]`, `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is 0. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` is `=`, and `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values.

Given the print statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **`mak` and `mak2`**:
   - If `s` is `<`, then `mak` is 0 and `mak2` is 0.
   - If `s` is `=`, then `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, which are not explicitly defined in the initial state but are assumed to be the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations.
   - If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, then `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, which are not explicitly defined in the initial state but are assumed to be the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations.

### Possible Scenarios:

- **If `s` is `<`**:
  - `mak` is 0.
  - `mak2` is 0.
  - `i` is 1.
  - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 1 0`.

- **If `s` is `=`**:
  - `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values (which are not explicitly defined, but we assume they are the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations).
  - `i` is 1.
  - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak2] 1 [mak2]` (where `mak` and `mak2` are the values of `mak` and `mak2` from the loop iterations).

- **If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`**:
  - `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values (which are not explicitly defined, but we assume they are the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations).
  - `i` is 1.
  - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak2] 1 [mak2]` (where `mak` and `mak2` are the values of `mak` and `mak2` from the loop iterations).

### Final Output:

Since the initial state does not provide the exact values of `mak` and `mak2` when `s` is not `<`, we can only be precise about the output when `s` is `<`.

Output: **? 0 0 1 0** (if `s` is `<`).

If `s` is `=` or neither `<` nor `=`, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 1 [mak2]** (where `mak` and `mak2` are the values of `mak` and `mak2` from the loop iterations).
