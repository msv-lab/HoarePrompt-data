The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer that indicates the number of test cases. Since the state before the loop starts mentions that the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, we need to ensure that the input is within this range.

State: **`_` is 0, the input must be an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
