Postcondition: ***`pans` is either an empty list, `[0]` if the initial `s` was `=`, or `[1]` if the initial `s` was `<`. `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is 1, and `pans` is `[2]`. If the new `s` is `=`, `pans` is updated to `[2]`, `[0, 2]` if the initial `s` was `=`, or `[1, 2]` if the initial `s` was `<`, and `mak` is 2 while `mak2` retains its original value. If the new `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either an empty list or contains `[0]` if the initial `s` was `=`.***
