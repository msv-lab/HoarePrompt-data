Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `mak` is 0
- `i` is 1

The print statement is:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- The first element is a string `'?`'.
- The second element is the value of `mak`, which is 0.
- The third element is the value of `mak` again, which is 0.
- The fourth element is the value of `i`, which is 1.
- The fifth element is the value of `i` again, which is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
