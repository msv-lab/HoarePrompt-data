Functionality: ** The function operates in an interactive environment where it processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then interacts with the environment by making queries to find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1` is maximized. The function outputs this pair of indices for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the output buffer is flushed. **
