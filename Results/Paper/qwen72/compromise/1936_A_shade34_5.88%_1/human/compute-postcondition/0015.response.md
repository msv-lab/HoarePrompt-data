Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. `_` is 0. This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it.
2. `n` is greater than 3. This variable is also not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it.
3. `i` is 3. This value will be printed as part of the `print` statement.
4. `mak` is 2 if the user input is `<`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 if the user input is not `<`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

- The first element printed is the string `'? '`.
- The next two elements are the value of `mak`, which will be either 2 or 0 depending on the user input.
- The last two elements are the value of `i`, which is 3.

If the user input is `<`, then `mak` will be 2. Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
```
? 2 2 3 3
```

If the user input is not `<`, then `mak` will remain 0. Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
```
? 0 0 3 3
```

Since the initial state does not specify the user input, we need to consider both cases. However, the output will depend on the user input at the time of execution.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 2 if the user input is `<` and 0 otherwise)**
