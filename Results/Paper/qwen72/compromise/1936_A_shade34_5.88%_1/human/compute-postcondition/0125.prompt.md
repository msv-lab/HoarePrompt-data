Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pans` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`pans` is either an empty list or a list containing `[0]` if `s` is equal to `=`, `i` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[0]`, `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is 0. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` is `=`, and `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`pans` is either an empty list, a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `=`, or a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<`. `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `n` is an input integer greater than 1. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 1. If `s` is `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values. If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` was `=`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`pans` is either an empty list, `[0]` if the initial `s` was `=`, or `[1]` if the initial `s` was `<`. `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is 1, and `pans` is `[2]`. If the new `s` is `=`, `pans` is updated to `[2]`, `[0, 2]` if the initial `s` was `=`, or `[1, 2]` if the initial `s` was `<`, and `mak` is 2 while `mak2` retains its original value. If the new `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either an empty list or contains `[0]` if the initial `s` was `=`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
