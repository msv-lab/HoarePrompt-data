Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - If `s` is `<`, then:
     - `mak` is 1.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `pans` is a list containing `[1]`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`).
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is not equal to `=`.
     - `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is equal to `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `mak2` is always equal to `mak` based on the initial state.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the input string `s`:
     - If `s` is `<`, then `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 0.
     - If `s` is not `<`, then `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`), and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1: `s` is `<`**
     - `mak` is 1.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `i` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 0 2 0`.

   - **Scenario 2: `s` is not `<`**
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`).
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `i` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak]` (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak`).

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `s` is `<`, the output will be: `? 1 0 2 0`.
   - If `s` is not `<`, the output will be: `? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak]` (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak`).

Output: **? 1 0 2 0 (if s is `<`) or ? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak] (if s is not `<`, where [mak] is the largest integer i for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution or 0 if no user input was `<`)**
