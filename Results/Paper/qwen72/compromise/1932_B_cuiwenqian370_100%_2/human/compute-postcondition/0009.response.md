The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `periodicities`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `periodicities` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the corresponding inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `periodicities` where each inner list contains integers representing periodicities. It returns a list of results, where each result is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the corresponding inner list.**
