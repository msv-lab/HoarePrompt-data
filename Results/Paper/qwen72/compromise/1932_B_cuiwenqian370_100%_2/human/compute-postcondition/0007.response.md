Output State: **The variable `index` is updated to the value `2 + 2 * T` (assuming each test case has exactly one integer `n` followed by `n` integers). The variable `results` is a list of strings, each representing the last year calculated for each test case. The variable `T` remains the same as its initial value, which is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
