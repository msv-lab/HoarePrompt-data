Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific case where the program fails is when the input string is such that the optimal position for the road is not at the midpoint or its immediate neighbors. For example, consider the input:

```
1
7
0110110
```

The optimal position for the road should be after the 3rd house, but the program outputs 4. This is because the program only checks the positions around the midpoint and does not consider the entire range of possible positions to find the optimal one. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
