Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `i` <= len(`a`) and 0 <= `j` <= len(`b`), `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`. The current value of `index` is not -1, indicating that `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`.**
