The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100. `k` is an integer between 2 and 100. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, but the frequency is capped at `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.**
