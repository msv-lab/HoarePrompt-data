### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed (since you need at least `k` cards to perform an operation). This is correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`. It uses a dictionary `frequency_table` to store the counts. The condition `if frequency_table[num] > k` ensures that the frequency of any card number does not exceed `k`. This is a valid optimization, but it does not affect the correctness of the program in this context.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - The program checks if any frequency in the `frequency_table` is exactly `k`. If so, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform an operation to exchange `k` cards for `k - 1` cards.
   - If no frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `n` because no operations can reduce the number of cards further.

However, the original assessment correctly identifies a logical flaw in the output logic:
- **Minimum Number of Cards**: The program should aim to minimize the number of cards left, not just check if any frequency is exactly `k`. The correct approach is to use the frequency table to determine how many cards can be reduced by performing the operations.

To correct this, the program should:
- Calculate the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing the operations.
- For each card number with a frequency of `f`, the number of cards that can be reduced is `f // k * (k - 1)`.
- The minimum number of cards left is `n - total_reduced`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        total_reduced = sum(f // k * (k - 1) for f in freq.values())
        print(n - total_reduced)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **func_1**: This function now correctly calculates the frequency of each card number without any unnecessary truncation.
- **total_reduced**: This variable calculates the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing the operations. For each card number with a frequency `f`, the number of cards that can be reduced is `f // k * (k - 1)`.
- **Output**: The program prints `n - total_reduced`, which is the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The corrected program addresses this issue and provides the correct solution.

Final: **False**
