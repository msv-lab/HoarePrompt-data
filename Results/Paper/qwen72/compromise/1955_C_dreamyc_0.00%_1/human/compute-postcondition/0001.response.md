Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums`, where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9, `ans` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `ans` is now set to 0.
