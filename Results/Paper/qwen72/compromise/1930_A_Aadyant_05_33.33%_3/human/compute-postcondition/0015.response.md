Output State: **`num` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of the third element of `list1` and the integer value of the fifth element of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, `a` must be greater than 2, `list2` now also contains the integer value of the seventh element of `list1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))` appends the integer value of the element at index `2 * i` (which is 4, since `i` is 2) of `list1` to `list2`.
- Since `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, the element at index 4 is the fifth element of `list1` (0-based indexing).
- The value of `2 * i` is 4, so the element at index 4 of `list1` is the fifth element, and the element at index 6 (2 * 2 + 2) is the seventh element.
- Therefore, `list2` now contains the integer values of the third, fifth, and seventh elements of `list1`.
