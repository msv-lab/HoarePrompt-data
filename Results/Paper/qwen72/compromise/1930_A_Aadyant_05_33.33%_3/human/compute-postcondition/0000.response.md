The code snippet `num = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `num`. The input is a string by default. The other variables and the precondition remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case. `num` is an input string.**
