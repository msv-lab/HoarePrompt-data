Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw. It does not correctly determine if a template exists such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets the variable `l` to 'YES' if any single character in `a` or `b` is different from the corresponding character in `c`. This means that even if only one character in `a` or `b` is different from `c`, the program will print 'YES' for the entire test case, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check for each position `i` from 1 to `n` if there exists a template character that can satisfy the conditions for both `a` and `b` but not for `c`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                possible = False
                break
            if a[i] != b[i]:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The variable `possible` is initialized to `True`. This variable will be used to track whether a valid template can be found.
2. **Loop through each character**: For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If `a[i]` or `b[i]` is the same as `c[i]`, then it is impossible to find a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`, so `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[i]` is different from `b[i]`, then it is also impossible to find a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`, so `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
3. **Output**: After the loop, if `possible` is still `True`, it means a valid template exists, and the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This corrected program ensures that the conditions for the template are correctly checked for each character position.
