You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function should determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match t, while string c does not.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: The variable `l` will be 'NO' for each test case after the loop executes all the iterations, because the `else` block of the inner loop is executed only if the loop completes without encountering a `break` statement, and in this case, it will always set `l` to 'NO' after checking all characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. The function checks if there exists at least one character position `i` (0 ≤ i < n) where `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It checks if the `i`-th character of `a` and `b` are different from the `i`-th character of `c`.
   - If this condition holds for all positions, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
   - If the condition fails for any position, it sets `l` to 'NO'.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `l` after processing each test case.

### Issues:
- **Logic Error**:
  - The program incorrectly sets `l` to 'YES' if the condition holds for any position, rather than all positions.
  - The `else` block is associated with the `for` loop, which means it will always execute after the loop, setting `l` to 'NO' even if the condition held for all positions.

### Corrected Logic:
- To correctly determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not, the program should:
  - Initialize `l` to 'YES' at the start of each test case.
  - Set `l` to 'NO' if the condition fails for any position.
  - Print `l` after the loop for each test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        l = 'YES'
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                l = 'NO'
                break
        print(l)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: `l` is initialized to 'YES' at the start of each test case.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
  - If `a[i]` or `b[i]` is the same as `c[i]`, it sets `l` to 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
- **Output**: After the loop, it prints `l`.

### Conclusion:
- The original program is incorrect due to the logic error in the `for` loop and the `else` block.
- The corrected program correctly implements the required logic.
