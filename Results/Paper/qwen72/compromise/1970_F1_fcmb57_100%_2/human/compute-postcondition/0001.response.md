Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, where 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd. `x` is the first element of `a` (which is `a` itself since `a` is an integer), `y` is the second element of `a` (which is undefined because `a` is an integer, not a tuple or list). A TypeError is raised because you cannot unpack an integer into two variables.**
