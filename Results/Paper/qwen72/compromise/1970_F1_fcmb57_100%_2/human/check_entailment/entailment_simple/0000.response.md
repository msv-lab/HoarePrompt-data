Reasoning:

The program is almost correct but has a critical issue in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to update the position of a player based on the movement direction. However, the function as defined raises a `TypeError` because it attempts to unpack an integer into two variables (`x` and `y`). This is because the `mouvements` dictionary contains tuples, and when `func_1` is called, it should be passing a tuple to the function, not an integer.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Issue**:
   - The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps movement directions to tuples of changes in coordinates.
   - However, the function `func_1` is defined to take two arguments: `a` (the current position) and `b` (the movement direction). It should unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and then add the corresponding values from `b` to `x` and `y`.
   - The function should be defined as `func_1(a, b)` where `a` is a tuple `(x, y)` and `b` is a tuple `(dx, dy)`.

2. **Correct Function Definition**:
   - The correct function should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(a, b):
         x, y = a
         dx, dy = b
         return (x + dx, y + dy)
     ```

3. **Rest of the Program**:
   - The rest of the program seems to correctly handle the parsing of the input, the movement of players, and the scoring logic.
   - The program correctly prints the goals and the final score based on the actions provided.

Given the critical issue in the `func_1` function, the program will not run correctly as is. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
