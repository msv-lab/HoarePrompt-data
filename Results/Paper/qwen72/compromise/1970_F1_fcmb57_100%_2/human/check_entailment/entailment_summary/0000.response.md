Reasoning:  
The program is incorrect due to a few issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle the movement of players. However, the function expects `a` and `b` to be tuples representing the current position and the movement direction, respectively. The function correctly unpacks these tuples and calculates the new position. However, the function is not being used correctly in the main loop. The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps directions to tuples, but the `players` dictionary stores positions as tuples, which is correct. The issue lies in the fact that the function `func_1` is not defined to handle the movement of the Quaffle or the logic of catching and throwing the Quaffle. The function should be used to update the player's position, but it should also handle the Quaffle's position if the player is carrying it.

2. **Handling the Quaffle**: The program does not keep track of which player is carrying the Quaffle. This is a critical part of the game logic, as a player can only score if they are carrying the Quaffle and place it in the opponent's goal. The program should have a variable or a dictionary to track the Quaffle's current carrier.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is incorrect. The program checks if the player is in a goal and then increments the score. However, it does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle. A player should only score if they are carrying the Quaffle and place it in the opponent's goal. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.

4. **Quaffle Reset**: The program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. This is a crucial part of the game rules.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the goals and the final score, but it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should be printed as the opposing team's goal.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
