Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, x and y are integers provided as input, with 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop will execute x times, and for each iteration, it will take two integers x and y as input. If x is less than y, it will print x followed by y. Otherwise, it will print y followed by x. The values of x and y will be updated with each iteration, and the final values of x and y will be the ones provided in the last input. The loop variable i will be equal to x-1 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is intended to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function reads an integer `x` from the user, and then for each value from 0 to `x-1`, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the final values of `x` and `y` will be the ones provided in the last input, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `x-1`.
