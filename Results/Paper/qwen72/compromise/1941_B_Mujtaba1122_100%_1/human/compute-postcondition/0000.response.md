To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n - 2` (inclusive).

For the loop to execute at least once:
1. `n` must be greater than 2, because if `n` is 2 or less, the range `range(1, n - 1)` will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
2. `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will start from 1 as specified by the `range` function.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute at least once. The adjusted state should reflect that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 1.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1**
