Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- The list is modified such that for each `i` in the range `1` to `n-2`:
  - If `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are all true, the values of `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` are decreased according to operations inside a while loop.
  - If at any point `list[i - 1]` becomes `0`, the loop prints 'no' and returns, terminating the function.
  - If the loop completes without `list[i - 1]` becoming `0` for any `i`, the list will have been modified but will not contain any 'no' print statements.
- Additionally, `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes a function `func_1(list, n)` that modifies the list based on certain conditions and prints 'no' if a specific condition is met.
- However, the initial state also states that `func_1(list, n)` returns `False` and does not print 'no' if the loop completes without any `list[i - 1]` becoming `0`.
- The code snippet `print('NO')` is executed after `func_1(list, n)` has returned `False` and has not printed 'no'.

### Conclusion:
- Since `func_1(list, n)` does not print 'no' and returns `False`, the code snippet `print('NO')` will be executed.
- The `print` statement will output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
