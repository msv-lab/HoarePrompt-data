### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using the operation: for any index \( i \) (2 ≤ \( i \) ≤ \( n - 1 \)), decrement \( a_{i-1} \) by 1, \( a_i \) by 2, and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an array of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( list[i] > 1 \), \( list[i-1] > 0 \), and \( list[i+1] > 0 \).
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation: \( list[i+1] -= 1 \times list[i-1] \), \( list[i] -= 2 \times list[i-1] \), and \( list[i-1] -= 1 \times list[i-1] \).
   - If at any point \( list[i-1] \) becomes zero, it prints 'no' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The function should handle arrays where the operation cannot be applied, such as when \( list[i-1] \) or \( list[i+1] \) are zero.
     - The function should also handle cases where the array is already zero or can be made zero with the given operation.
   - **Logic**:
     - The operation \( list[i+1] -= 1 \times list[i-1] \), \( list[i] -= 2 \times list[i-1] \), and \( list[i-1] -= 1 \times list[i-1] \) is applied correctly.
     - However, the condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` might not be sufficient to ensure that all elements can be made zero. Specifically, the function does not handle cases where \( list[i] \) is 1 or 0, which might still be valid for making the array zero.
     - The function also prints 'no' and returns immediately if \( list[i-1] \) becomes zero, which might not be the correct behavior. It should only return 'no' if it is impossible to make all elements zero.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the function correctly applies the operations and makes all elements zero.
   - For the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, the function might not correctly determine that it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - For the array `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`, the function correctly applies the operations and makes all elements zero.
   - For the array `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`, the function might not correctly determine that it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 7, 2]`, the function might not correctly determine that it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - For the array `[7, 1, 0]`, the function might not correctly determine that it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - For the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function correctly determines that it is impossible to make all elements zero.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when \( list[i] \) is 1 or 0, and it might prematurely return 'no' without fully exploring the possibility of making all elements zero. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
