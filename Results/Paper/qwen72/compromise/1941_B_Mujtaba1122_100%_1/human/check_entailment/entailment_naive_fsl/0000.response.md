Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The operation described in the problem is to choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`. However, the program incorrectly applies the operation by using `list[i - 1]` as the multiplier for the subtraction, which is not part of the problem's operation rules.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where the array elements are not sufficient to perform the operation. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 1]`, it should be impossible to make all elements zero, but the program does not correctly handle this case.

3. **Final Check**: The function `func_1` is used to check if all elements are zero, but it is called after the operations are applied. If the operations are applied incorrectly, `func_1` will not return the correct result.

4. **Print Statements**: The program uses `print('no')` and `print('YES')` or `print('NO')` directly, which does not match the required output format of the problem description. The output should be "YES" or "NO" without any additional text.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: `3\n3\n1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Actual Output: `no` (which is incorrect because it should be `NO` without the additional `no`).

To correct the program, the operation should be applied correctly, and the output format should be strictly followed. Additionally, the program should handle edge cases where it is impossible to make all elements zero.
