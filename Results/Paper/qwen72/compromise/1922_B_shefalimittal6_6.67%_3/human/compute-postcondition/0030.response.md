Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third entry in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and `res` remains 0 if `cnt` is less than 3, or `res` is updated to the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
