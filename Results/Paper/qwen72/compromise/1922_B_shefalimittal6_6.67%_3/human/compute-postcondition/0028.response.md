Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third entry in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt`. If the previous `cnt` was greater than or equal to 3, `res` is now the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res`. If the previous `cnt` was less than 3, `res` remains 0.**
