Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third entry in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and `res` is updated to `res` + `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its current value.
- `math.comb(cnt, 2)` calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `total_sum`) remain unchanged.
