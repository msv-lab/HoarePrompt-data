Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time.**

Explanation:
- `res` is incremented by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, which calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `x`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `res` after this operation depends on the initial value of `res` and the value of `cnt`.
