To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which in this case are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop index is not used within the loop body. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5

We only need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
