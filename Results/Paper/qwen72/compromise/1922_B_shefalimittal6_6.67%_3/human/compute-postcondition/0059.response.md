Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.**

The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `total_sum` is still the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.
