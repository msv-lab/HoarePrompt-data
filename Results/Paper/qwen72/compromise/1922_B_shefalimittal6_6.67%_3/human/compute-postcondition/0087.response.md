Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
- `math.comb(cnt, 2)` calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items, which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) / 2`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`.
- The new value of `res` is the previous value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `x`, `cnt`, and `total_sum`) remain unchanged.
