The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least three integers, the loop will execute again for the third integer. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` had at least two integers, `x` was the second integer in the list `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least three integers, and `x` will be the third integer in the list `nums`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1 (if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`) or the previous value of `num_of_lens[x]` plus 1 (if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`), `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `nums`, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in `num_of_lens` values.**
