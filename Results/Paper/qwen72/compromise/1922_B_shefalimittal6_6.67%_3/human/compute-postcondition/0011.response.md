Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is still the input integer, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the count of each integer in the list `nums`. The list `nums` itself remains unchanged.
