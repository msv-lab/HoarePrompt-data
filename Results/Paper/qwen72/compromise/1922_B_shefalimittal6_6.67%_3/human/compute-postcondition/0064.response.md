Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is incremented by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for the value of `cnt`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- `total_sum` is a new variable that holds the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`.
