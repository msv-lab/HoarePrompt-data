Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0.***
