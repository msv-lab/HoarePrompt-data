Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
- `math.comb(cnt, 2)` calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `x`, `cnt`, `total_sum`) remain unchanged.
