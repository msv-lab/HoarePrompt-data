Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`, `res` remains unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than or equal to 1, `n` is still the input integer, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains each unique integer from the list `nums` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`. The variable `res` is unchanged, and `nums` is the original list of integers, with `x` being the last element processed by the loop.
