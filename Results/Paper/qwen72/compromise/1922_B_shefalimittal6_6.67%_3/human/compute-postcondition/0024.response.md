The code snippet calculates the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`, and assigns this sum to the variable `total_sum`. 

- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the value of the second entry in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; otherwise, `res` remains 0, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**
