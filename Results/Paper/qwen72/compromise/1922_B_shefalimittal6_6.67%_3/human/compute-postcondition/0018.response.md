Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the value of the first entry in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 2, `res` remains 0 or is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` added to its previous value (which was 0), `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `total_sum` by summing all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- The value of `res` remains as it was, which is either 0 or the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` added to its previous value (which was 0).
- `total_sum` is now the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.
