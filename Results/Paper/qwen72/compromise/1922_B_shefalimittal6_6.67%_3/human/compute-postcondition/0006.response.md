Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list `nums`.**

The code snippet updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of the first integer `x` in the list `nums`. If `x` was not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
