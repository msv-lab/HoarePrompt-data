Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 2 (if `x` was not in `num_of_lens` before) or incremented by 1 (if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`), `res` remains unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list `nums`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the value associated with the key `x` by 1.
- If `x` was not in `num_of_lens` before, its value is set to 1 (default value from `get(x, 0)`) and then incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 2.
- If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `nums`) remain unchanged.
