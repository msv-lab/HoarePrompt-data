### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step, using the provided function summaries and the problem description.

#### Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- **Behavior**:
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If so, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
  - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the total number of extroverts and universals by 3, which is the number of tents needed.

#### Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the total number of tents needed for all participants.
- **Behavior**:
  - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of `func_1`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
- **Expected Output**: `3`
- **Actual Output**: `-1`

**Step-by-Step Breakdown**:
1. **Introverts**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
2. **Extroverts and Universals**:
   - `extroverts = 4`, `universals = 2`
   - `extroverts % 3 = 1` (since 4 % 3 = 1)
   - `extroverts % 3 + universals = 1 + 2 = 3` (which is not less than 3)
   - Therefore, `func_1(4, 2)` should return `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = ceil(6 / 3) = 2`

3. **Total Tents**:
   - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`

However, the program returns `-1` for this test case, which is incorrect.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Issue**: The function `func_1` is not correctly handling the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. Specifically, it should ensure that the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents of 3 people.
- **Correct Approach**:
  - If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, then all extroverts can be accommodated in complete tents.
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, then we need to check if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be paired with universals to form complete tents of 3 people.
  - If the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals, then the total number of tents needed is `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
  - If the remaining extroverts cannot be paired with universals, then it is impossible to accommodate the participants, and the function should return `None`.

### Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 == 0:
        return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    else:
        remaining_extroverts = extroverts % 3
        if remaining_extroverts <= universals:
            return ceil((extroverts + universals - remaining_extroverts) / 3) + 1
        else:
            return None
```

### Final Evaluation:
- **Original Assessment**: The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.
- **Correctness**: **False**

Final: **False**
