### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is designed to determine if the extroverts and universals can be accommodated in tents such that each tent with an extrovert has exactly 3 people.
   - **Logic**:
     - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it means there are some extroverts left over that cannot form a complete tent of 3 people.
     - The function checks if the sum of the leftover extroverts (`extroverts % 3`) and the universals is at least 3. If it is, these universals can fill the remaining spots in the tent.
     - If the sum is less than 3, it is impossible to form a complete tent, and the function returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the total number of tents needed, considering the introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - **Logic**:
     - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to determine if the extroverts and universals can be accommodated according to their preferences.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of `func_1`, which represents the total number of tents needed.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and preferences of the participants.
   - For introverts, each one needs a separate tent, which is correctly accounted for.
   - For extroverts, the function ensures that each tent with an extrovert has exactly 3 people, using universals to fill any remaining spots if necessary.
   - The program returns -1 if it is impossible to form the required tents, which aligns with the problem description.
   - The test cases provided in the example are correctly handled by the program, as shown in the execution summaries.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

**Correctness: True**
