Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged, `soma_b` is the sum of the elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of `soma_b` values and the corresponding elements in `lista_A` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-k-1` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`.**
