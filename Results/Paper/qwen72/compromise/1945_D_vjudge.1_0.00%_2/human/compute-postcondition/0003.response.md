The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter `numero_testes` is described in the constraints as a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. Since the function does not accept `numero_testes` as an argument, it must be defined or used in some other context (e.g., as a global variable or within the function body). The output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is not clear from the provided information, as the output is not specified.**
