Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index -1, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. Since `idx2` is -1, `a1` is inserted just before the last element of `l1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `idx1` is greater than `idx2` still holds true.
