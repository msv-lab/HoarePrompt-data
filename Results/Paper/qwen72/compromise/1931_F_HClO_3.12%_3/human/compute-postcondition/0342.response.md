Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`. If `idx1` < `idx2`, `l` is equal to `l2` and `a2` has been inserted into `l2` at the second-to-last position. If `idx1` > `idx2`, `a1` has been inserted into `l1` at the second-to-last position and `l` is equal to `l1`. If `idx1` == `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1.***
