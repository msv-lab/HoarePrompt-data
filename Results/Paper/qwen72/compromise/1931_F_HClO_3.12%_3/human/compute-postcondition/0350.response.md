Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input, `_` is incremented by 1.**

The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a3` and `l3` based on the user input. `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l3` is assigned a list of integers from the remaining input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
