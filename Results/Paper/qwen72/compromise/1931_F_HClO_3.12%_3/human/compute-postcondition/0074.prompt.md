Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `_` is set to `m - 3`. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `_` is set to `m - 3`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1. In all cases, if `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values and conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `idx1` is set to `i` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `p1` is 1; otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If either `idx1` or `idx2` is negative, the most internal loop or if statement continues without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i + 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0` and `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i + 1` and `p1` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to `i + 1` and `p2` is set to 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
