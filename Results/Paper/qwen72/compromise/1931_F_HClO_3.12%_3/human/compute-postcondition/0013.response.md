The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2. The state of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` do not affect the loop's execution directly, as they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2**
