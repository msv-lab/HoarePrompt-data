The code snippet `input()` reads a new line of input from the user but does not assign it to any variable. This means that the input is read but not stored or used in any calculations, and thus does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a1` is the first integer from the initial input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the initial input, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1.**
