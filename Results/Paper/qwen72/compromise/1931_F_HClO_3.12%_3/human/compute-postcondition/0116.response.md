The only objects in the loop head are variables `a3` and `l3`, and the list `val`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables are updated and the conditions under which the loop can continue.

1. **`val`**: This is the list that is being iterated over. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must have at least one more tuple to iterate over. Since `val` has `m - 2` tuples and must have at least one tuple, for the loop to execute again, `val` must have at least two tuples.

2. **`a3` and `l3`**: These variables are set by the next tuple in `val` at the start of each iteration. After the previous iteration, `a3` and `l3` were set by the first tuple in `val`. For the next iteration, they will be set by the second tuple in `val`.

3. **Other variables**: Variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `_` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `val` must have at least two tuples.
- `a3` and `l3` are set by the second tuple in `val`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `a3` and `l3` are set by the second tuple in `val`, `_` is 0.**
