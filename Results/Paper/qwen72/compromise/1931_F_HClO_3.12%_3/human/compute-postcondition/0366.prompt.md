Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple consisting of an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` must contain at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the integer from the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of integers from the first tuple in `val`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding the integer `a3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` must contain at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the integer from the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of integers from the second tuple in `val`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, and `m` must be greater than 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding the integer `a3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` must contain at least 3 tuples, `a3` is the integer from the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of integers from the third tuple in `val`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, and `m` must be greater than 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
