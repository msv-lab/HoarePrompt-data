Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers.**

The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` assigns the first integer from the input to `a3` and the remaining integers to the list `l3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `l`, and `m` are still valid as per the initial state.
