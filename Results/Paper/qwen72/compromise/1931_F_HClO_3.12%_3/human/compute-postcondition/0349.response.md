The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is being incremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop. The loop condition is `_ in range(m - 2)`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` was incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `_` must be incremented by 1 again. The state of `m` must remain such that `m` is greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `_` is incremented by 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input.**

Simplified State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input, `_` is incremented by 1.**
