Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. For each test case, it reads the order of participants shown to each screenshot author. The function then determines if the order of participants can be made consistent across all screenshots by inserting the author of one screenshot into the list of another screenshot at the correct position. If the order can be made consistent, it prints 'yes' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the results have been printed. **
