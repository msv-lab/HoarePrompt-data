To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `m` must be greater than 2.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` is 0
- `p2` is 0
- `idx1` is -1
- `idx2` is -1
- `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`
- `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`
- If `idx1` < `idx2`, `l` is equal to `l2` and `a2` has been inserted into `l2` at the second-to-last position.
- If `idx1` > `idx2`, `a1` has been inserted into `l1` at the second-to-last position and `l` is equal to `l1`.
- If `idx1` == `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1.

The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2**
