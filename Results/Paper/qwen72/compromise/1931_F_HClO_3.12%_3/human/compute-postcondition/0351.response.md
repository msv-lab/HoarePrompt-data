Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)`, `(a3, l3)`, and `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`.
- Initially, `val` contains the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`.
- After appending, `val` now contains three tuples: `(a3, l3)`, `(a3, l3)`, and `(a3, l3)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `_`) remain unchanged.
