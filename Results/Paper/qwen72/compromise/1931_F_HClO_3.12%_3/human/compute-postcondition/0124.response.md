Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 0. If all the tuples in `val` satisfy the condition that `l3` is equal to the list of all elements from `l` except those that are equal to `a3`, the loop completes and prints 'yes'. Otherwise, the loop breaks and prints 'no'.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions (`t > 0`, `n > 1`, `m` is an integer, etc.) remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates over each tuple in the list `val`, which contains `m - 2` tuples.
- For each iteration, `a3` and `l3` are set to the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from the current tuple.
- The loop checks if `l3` is equal to the list of all elements from `l` (the list of remaining integers from the input) except those that are equal to `a3`.
- If this condition is true for all tuples in `val`, the loop completes and prints 'yes'.
- If the condition is false for any tuple, the loop breaks and prints 'no'.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `_` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
