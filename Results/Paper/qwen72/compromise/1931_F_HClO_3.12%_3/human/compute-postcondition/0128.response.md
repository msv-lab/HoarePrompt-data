Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` is the first integer from the new input.
3. `m` is the second integer from the new input.
4. `a1` is the first integer from the initial input.
5. `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the initial input.
6. `a2` is the first integer from the second input.
7. `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input.
8. `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`.
9. `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`.
10. `i` is `n - 2`.
11. `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
12. `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1.
13. `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input.
14. `_` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'yes'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about various variables and lists, but none of this information affects the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or lists mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'yes'` regardless of the values of the variables and lists described in the initial state.

Output: **yes**
