Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list containing all elements from the new input except those that are equal to `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `_` is set to `m - 3`. `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value before the loop breaks), `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`. `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1. `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than `idx2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the integer `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`.
- This changes the composition of `l2`, but does not affect the other variables or conditions.
- The new `l2` now includes `a2` at the specified index, and the rest of the list remains unchanged.
- All other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain valid.
