You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are different), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and always appears at the top of the list. The sum of n · k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all authors of the screenshots are different.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. For each test case, it also accepts the order of participants shown to each screenshot author. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating the order of participants shown to each screenshot author.
