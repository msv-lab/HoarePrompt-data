Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `val` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`.
   - `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the first tuple in `val`.
   - The list `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('no')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'no'`.
   - The values of `a3` and `l3` are not directly used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.
   - The condition that `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3` is also not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'no'`, regardless of the values of `a3` and `l3`.

Output: **no**
