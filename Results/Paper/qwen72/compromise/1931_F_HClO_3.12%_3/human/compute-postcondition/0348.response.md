Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `_` is incremented by 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input.**

The code appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` already contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`, after the execution, `val` will contain two identical tuples `(a3, l3)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
