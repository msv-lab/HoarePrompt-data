Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple consisting of an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The loop runs `m - 2` times, appending a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val` in each iteration.
- Each tuple `(a3, l3)` consists of an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, which are read from the input in each iteration.
- After all iterations, `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples, each representing the input values from each iteration of the loop.
