The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the integer `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`. This impacts the contents of `l2` and potentially the relationship between `l11` and `l22` if `m` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, if `m` is equal to 2, `l11` is equal to `l22` (after `a2` is inserted into `l2`), `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value before the loop breaks), `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is equal to 2, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
