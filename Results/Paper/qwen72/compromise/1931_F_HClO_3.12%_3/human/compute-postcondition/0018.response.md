The `input()` function is called, which waits for user input. However, the input is not assigned to any variable, so the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only impact is that the program execution pauses until the user provides input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2.**
