Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`. `l2` now includes `a2` at the position `idx1` (which is -1, so `a2` is inserted at the end of `l2`).**
