Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `inf` is set to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` to handle the maximum possible value of `n` plus one.
   - `values` is a list initialized to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `inf`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `inf` and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` list.
   - For each number `i` from 1 to `inf`, the sum of its digits is calculated by converting the number to a string and iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer and adding it to `sum_value_digits`.
   - The cumulative sum is then updated as `values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum for that value from the `values` list.

This approach ensures that the program can handle up to `10^4` test cases efficiently, as the precomputation is done only once and each test case is answered in constant time by looking up the precomputed value.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for valid inputs.
