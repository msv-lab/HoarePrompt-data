You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of integers n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case, where n is the largest number written on the board.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0

    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `n` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 200000.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200001, `values` remains a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `n` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 200000. The loop prints the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to the value provided by the user for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `value` which represents the largest number Vladislav writes.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The function initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (200,001) to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for each `i` in the range.
   - It iterates from 1 to `inf` and calculates the sum of the digits of each number `i` by converting `i` to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.
   - It then updates the `values` array at index `i` with the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the value `value` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `value` from the `values` array.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The precomputation step runs in O(inf) time, where `inf` is 200,001. This is efficient and can be done within the time limit.
   - Each test case is processed in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed value in the `values` array.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The precomputation correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `inf`.
   - The cumulative sum is correctly stored in the `values` array.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It efficiently precomputes the necessary values and processes each test case in constant time.

Correctness: **True**
