Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer from the user input, calculates the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to that number, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` remaining unchanged, and `values` being a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. **
