The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `inf`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `inf`. The loop starts from `1` and goes up to `inf - 1` (since `range(1, inf)` does not include `inf` itself). For the loop to execute, `inf` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of an input integer, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 200000, `i` is 1**
