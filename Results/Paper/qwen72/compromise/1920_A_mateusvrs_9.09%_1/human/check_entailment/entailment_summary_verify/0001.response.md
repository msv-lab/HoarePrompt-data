### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values that `k` should not be equal to (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the value `x` are read.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and subtracts the number of invalid values in `cx` that fall within this range.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Bounds Calculation**:
  - The function correctly updates the lower bound `bx` and the upper bound `ax` based on the constraints. This ensures that the bounds are correctly set for each test case.

- **Invalid Values Handling**:
  - The function correctly identifies and excludes the invalid values from the set `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. This is done by iterating over the set `cx` and checking if each value falls within the range `[bx, ax]`.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - The function correctly checks if the bounds are feasible (`bx < ax`). If the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, indicating that no valid integer `k` exists.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - The function correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values from the total range. The total range is calculated as `ax - bx + 1`, and the number of invalid values is subtracted from this total.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Constraint of Type 1 and Type 2**:
  - The function handles cases where there is only one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2. For example, if the constraints are `1 5` and `2 4`, the function correctly returns `0` because no integer `k` can satisfy both constraints.

- **Multiple Constraints of Type 3**:
  - The function correctly handles multiple constraints of type 3. For example, if the constraints are `1 3`, `2 10`, `3 1`, and `3 5`, the function correctly identifies the valid integers `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` and returns `7`.

- **No Overlapping Constraints**:
  - The function correctly handles cases where the constraints do not overlap. For example, if the constraints are `1 10000`, `2 900000000`, `3 500000000`, `1 100000000`, `3 10000`, and `3 900000001`, the function correctly calculates the number of valid integers and returns `800000000`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
