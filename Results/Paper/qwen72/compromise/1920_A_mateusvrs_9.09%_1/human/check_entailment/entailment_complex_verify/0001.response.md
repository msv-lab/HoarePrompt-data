### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values that `k` should not be equal to (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the value `x` are read.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and subtracts the number of invalid values in `cx` that fall within this range.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Bounds Calculation**:
  - The function correctly updates `bx` and `ax` based on the constraints. This ensures that `bx` is the maximum lower bound and `ax` is the minimum upper bound.
  - The initialization of `ax` to a very large value and `bx` to `-1` ensures that the bounds are correctly updated even if there are no constraints of type 2 or type 1, respectively.

- **Invalid Values Handling**:
  - The function correctly identifies and excludes the invalid values from the set `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
  - The use of a set for `cx` ensures that duplicate values are not added, which is consistent with the problem statement that no two constraints are the same.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - The function correctly checks if the bounds are feasible (`bx < ax`). If not, it returns `0`, which is the correct behavior when there is no valid integer `k`.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - The function correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values from the total range `[bx, ax]`.
  - The formula `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid integers, where `tmp` is the count of invalid values in the range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
