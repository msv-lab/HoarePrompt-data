The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `cx` is initially an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise it contains the element `x`.
- After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will contain the element `x` regardless of the value of `a`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1` if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.**
