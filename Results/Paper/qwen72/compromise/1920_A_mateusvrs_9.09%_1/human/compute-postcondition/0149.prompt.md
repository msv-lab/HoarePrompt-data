Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case. `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is either a list containing [0] if `bx` ≥ `ax`, or a list containing one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx` < `ax`. `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, and `cx` is a set containing all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3. If `bx` < `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list, `n` is 0, `tmp` is 0 or the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing all unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3, and `a` and `x` are no longer relevant. If `bx` ≥ `ax`, `r` is a list containing two elements `[1000000008, 0]`. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `n` is 0, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 2 (or 1000000007 if no such input was given), `cx` is a set containing all unique values from the inputs with `a` being 3, and `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]`. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
