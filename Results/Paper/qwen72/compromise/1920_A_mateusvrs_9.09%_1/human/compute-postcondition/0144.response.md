The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Initially, `tmp` can be either 0 or 2 based on the conditions described in the initial state. After the increment, `tmp` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 3 if it was initially 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is 0, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 2 (or 1000000007 if no such input was given), `cx` is a set containing at least one unique value from the inputs with `a` being 3, and `i` is the next element in `cx`. If `i` is in the range `[bx, ax]`, then `tmp` is now 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is now 1.**
