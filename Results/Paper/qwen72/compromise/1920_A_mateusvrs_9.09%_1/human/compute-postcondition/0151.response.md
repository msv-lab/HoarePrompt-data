The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints.
  - A list of constraints, each represented by a pair `(a, x)` where:
    - `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint.
    - `x` is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.

The function processes these constraints and returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the output is not specified, but it is implied that the function computes some solution based on the given constraints, ensuring that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2 in each test case, which guarantees a finite solution.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, it accepts the number of constraints `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of constraints, each represented by a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function processes these constraints and returns a result for each test case, ensuring that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2 in each test case, guaranteeing a finite solution.**
