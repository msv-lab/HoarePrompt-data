The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial state, `tmp` could be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`. After executing the code, `tmp` will be incremented by 1.

- If `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, `tmp` was initially 1 and will now be 2.
- If `i` is not within the range `[bx, ax]`, `tmp` was initially 0 and will now be 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (where `tmp` is now 1 if `i` was not in the range `[bx, ax]` or 2 if `i` was in the range `[bx, ax]`), `n` is 0, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 2 (or 1000000007 if no such input was given), `cx` is a set containing at least one unique value from the inputs with `a` being 3, and `i` is the second element in `cx`.**
