Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is either a list containing [0] if `bx` ≥ `ax`, or a list containing one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx` < `ax`. `n` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `bx` < `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, and `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, and `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1` if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise a set containing the element `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `ax` is 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, and `cx` is an empty set. For any other value of `a`, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, and `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
