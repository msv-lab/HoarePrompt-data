The code initializes an empty list `r`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the constraints described in the initial state. The only change is the creation of the empty list `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case. `r` is an empty list.**
