To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `r` is an empty list
- `n` is 0
- `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007
- `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1
- `cx` is a set containing all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `tmp` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in cx:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the set `cx`.
- For the loop to execute, `cx` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `cx`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `cx` must have at least one element.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `r` is an empty list
- `n` is 0
- `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007
- `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1
- `cx` is a set containing at least one unique input integer `x` when `a` is 3
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `tmp` is 0

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique input integer `x` when `a` is 3, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0**
