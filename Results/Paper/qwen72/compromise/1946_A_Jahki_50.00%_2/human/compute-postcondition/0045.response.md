Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`.** 

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(a)` creates a new list `b` which contains the elements of `a` sorted in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
