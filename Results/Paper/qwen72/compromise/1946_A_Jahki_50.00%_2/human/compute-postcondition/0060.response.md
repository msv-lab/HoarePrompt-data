The code snippet `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value at index `ma` of the sorted list `b` to the variable `new_median`. This means `new_median` now holds the value of the median element in the list `b`.

Let's summarize the impact on the program:

- `new_median` is updated to the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `b`, `ma`, `median`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (now incremented by 1), `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.**
