Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `case = input()` updates the variable `case` to the value of the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated value of `case`.
