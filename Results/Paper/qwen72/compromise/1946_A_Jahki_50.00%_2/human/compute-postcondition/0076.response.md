The code snippet provided updates the array `a` by parsing the input string `case` and extracting only the digit strings, converting them to integers, and storing them in `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `num` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is updated to contain only the integers extracted from the digit strings in `case`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of integers extracted from the digit strings in `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0.**
