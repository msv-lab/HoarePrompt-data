To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), representing the length of the array `a`.
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `num` is an input integer.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, num):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `num` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and will increment by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `num`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `num` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` should be initialized to 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**.
