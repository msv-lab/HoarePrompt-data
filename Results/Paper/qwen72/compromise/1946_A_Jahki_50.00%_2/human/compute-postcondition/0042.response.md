The given `print` statement simply outputs the integer `16668`. The initial state provides details about various variables and their constraints, but none of these variables or conditions directly influence the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same value regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, or `op`.

Output: **16668**
