Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and its current value is greater than 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
