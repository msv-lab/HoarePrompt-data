Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is the number of times the loop executed, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (now incremented by the number of times the loop executed), `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (which is now equal to `median`).**

In natural language, the loop continues to increment the value at the median index (`ma`) of the sorted list `b` until the value at this index (`new_median`) is no longer less than or equal to the original median value (`median`). The variable `op` keeps track of how many times the loop has executed. After the loop finishes, the value at the median index in the list `b` will be the original median value plus the number of times the loop executed, and `new_median` will be equal to this updated median value. All other variables remain unchanged.
