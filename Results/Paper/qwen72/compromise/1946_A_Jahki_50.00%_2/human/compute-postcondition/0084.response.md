The value of `b[ma]` is incremented by 1. Since `ma` is the index of the median in the sorted array `b`, the value at this index is now one more than it was before. The new value of `b[ma]` is `median + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of integers extracted from the digit strings in `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma] + 1`**.
