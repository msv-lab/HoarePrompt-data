You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Alice

    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It first checks if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone. If so, Alice can always win by choosing `k = set_[0]` (the smallest pile size), which will empty all piles at once.
   - If the smallest pile has 1 stone, the function then checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. This is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and iterating through them.
   - If the differences are all 1, the function toggles the boolean `A` one more time to account for the final move.
   - The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" if `A` is `False`.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always win by choosing `k = set_[0]`, which will empty all piles.
   - If the smallest pile has 1 stone, the game becomes more complex. The key observation is that if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1, the game is essentially a sequence of moves where each player can only remove 1 stone at a time. This means the game will end in a fixed number of moves, and the winner can be determined by the parity of the number of moves.
   - If the differences are not all 1, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a position where the differences are all 1, ensuring Alice's win.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the smallest pile has more than 1 stone correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the smallest pile has 1 stone and the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1 correctly.
   - The program correctly toggles the boolean `A` to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of moves.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses sorting and set operations, which are efficient given the constraints. Sorting a list of up to \(2 \times 10^5\) elements is feasible within the time limits.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and constraints. It handles all edge cases and the optimal play strategy correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
