Output State: **`c` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, `ans` is the product of the next element in `arr` multiplied by the next element in `arr` and the next element in `arr`, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `ans` was initially the product of the next element in `arr` multiplied by the next element in `arr`, and `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is now the product of the next element in `arr` squared and the next element in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
