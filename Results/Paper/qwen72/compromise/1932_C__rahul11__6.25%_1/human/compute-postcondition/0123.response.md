Postcondition: ***`c` is 1, `l` is 0 if `s[k]` is not 'L' and 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L' and `n - 2` if `s[k]` is not 'L', `res` is a list of length `n` where the first and second elements are `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first element if `s[k]` is 'L' and except the last element if `s[k]` is not 'L', `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, and `k` is 0.***
