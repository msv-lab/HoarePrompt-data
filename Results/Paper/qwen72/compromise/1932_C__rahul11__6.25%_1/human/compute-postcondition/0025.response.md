Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is `n * m // m % MOD`, `i` is `m`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, and the first character of `s` is not 'L'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` updates the element at index `c` in the list `res`.
- The value of `c` is 1.
- The value of `ans` is `n * m // m % MOD`.
- The value of `ans % m % MOD` is calculated and assigned to `res[1]`.
- The first element of `res` (i.e., `res[0]`) was already updated to `ans % m % MOD` in the initial state.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
