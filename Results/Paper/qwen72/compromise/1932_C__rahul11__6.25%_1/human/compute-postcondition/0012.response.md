Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `m * m * n`, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is initially `m * m`.
- The value of `i` is `n`.
- The code `ans *= i` multiplies `ans` by `i`, so `ans` becomes `m * m * n`.
- The states of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `arr`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `res`) remain unchanged.
