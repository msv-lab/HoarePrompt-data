To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `arr`.

1. **`i`**: This variable will take the values from the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
2. **`arr`**: This is the list that `i` will iterate over. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers.

Since `arr` is already defined as a list with two integers, the loop will execute at least once. However, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the first value in `arr` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `i` is the first element of `arr`, which is `n`.
- `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `res`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 1, `i` is `n`**
