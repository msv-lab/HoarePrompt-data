Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `l` is `l + 1`, `k` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`. The value of `arr[r]` is not specified, but it is one of the integers in `arr`, which is `[n, m]`.
- The values of `res[0]`, `res[1]`, and `res[c]` are based on the old value of `ans` before the update.
- All other variables (`c`, `arr`, `i`, `l`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
