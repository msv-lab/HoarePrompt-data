Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `i`, `i` is `n`**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Initially, `ans` is 1 and `i` is `n`. After the execution, `ans` becomes `n` (since 1 * `n` = `n`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
