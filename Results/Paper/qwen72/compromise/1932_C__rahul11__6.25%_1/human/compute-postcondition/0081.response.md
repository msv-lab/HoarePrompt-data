Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- `res[0]` and `res[1]` are both updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- `l` remains 0 or 1 depending on the initial condition.
- `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial condition.
- `c` is increased by 1.
- `k` is set to `n - 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `k`, which is `n - 1`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged.
