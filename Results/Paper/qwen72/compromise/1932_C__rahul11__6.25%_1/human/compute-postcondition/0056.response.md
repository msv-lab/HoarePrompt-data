Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` will take the values of `n` and `m` in sequence during the loop iterations, `ans` is updated to `ans * i` for each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i` for each iteration of the loop.
- Since `i` takes the values of `n` and `m` in sequence, `ans` will be updated twice: once with `n` and once with `m`.
- The initial state of `ans` is not specified, so we assume it has some initial value.
- After the first iteration, `ans` becomes `ans * n`.
- After the second iteration, `ans` becomes `ans * n * m`.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The loop continues to the next iteration, so `i` will take the next value in `arr` (which is `m` after the first iteration).
