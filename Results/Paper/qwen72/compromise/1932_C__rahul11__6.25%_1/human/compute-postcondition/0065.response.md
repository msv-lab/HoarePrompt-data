Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The value of `r` is now `n - 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
