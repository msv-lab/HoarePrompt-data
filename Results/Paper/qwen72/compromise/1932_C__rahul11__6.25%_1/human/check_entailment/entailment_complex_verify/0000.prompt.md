You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000
    
    R

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `k` (0 ≤ k < n) is `ans % m % MOD` after the corresponding iteration, `ans` is the final value after all updates based on the characters in `s`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `k` is `n - 1`, and `MOD` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, a list `arr` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of `n` characters ('L' or 'R'). For each test case, it calculates a product of the integers in `arr`, then iteratively updates this product based on the characters in `s`. The final result is a list `res` of `n` integers, where each element at index `k` (0 ≤ k < n) is the updated product modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. The function prints the list `res` for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that all test cases have been processed, and the list `res` has been printed for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `MOD` retain their initial or updated values as per the function's execution, but the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the product of the elements in the array is zero or when the array contains a zero. When the product is zero, or the array contains a zero, dividing by any element of the array (which includes zero) will result in a division by zero error. This is a critical flaw in the logic of the program.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 7
0 2 3
LRL
```
The expected output should be:
```
0 0 0
```
However, the program will encounter a division by zero error when it tries to divide the product by the first element (which is 0) after the first command 'L'. This makes the program incorrect.
