### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 and then multiplies it by each element of `arr` to get the product of all elements.
   - This is correct for calculating the initial product of the array.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program calculates the remainder of the product `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.
   - The additional modulo `MOD` (10^9 + 6) is unnecessary and can be removed since the problem only requires the remainder modulo `m`.

4. **Command Processing**:
   - The program iterates through the command string `s` and processes each command.
   - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element of the array, updates `res`, and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element of the array, updates `res`, and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - The division `ans // arr[l]` and `ans // arr[r]` is correct for removing the element from the product.
   - However, the current order of operations `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans // arr[r] % MOD` is incorrect. The modulo `MOD` should not be applied during the division step. Instead, the division should be performed first, and then the result should be taken modulo `m`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Modulo `MOD`**: The program uses an additional modulo `MOD` (10^9 + 6) which is not required by the problem statement. This can be removed to simplify the code and avoid potential issues.
- **Division and Modulo Order**: The division `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans // arr[r] % MOD` should be `ans // arr[l]` and `ans // arr[r]` followed by a single modulo `m` operation. The current order of operations can lead to incorrect results if `MOD` is not a multiple of `m`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l]
                res[c] = ans % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r]
                res[c] = ans % m
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program correctly processes the commands and outputs the remainders as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False** (due to the unnecessary `MOD` and incorrect division and modulo order). However, the corrected program is **True**.
