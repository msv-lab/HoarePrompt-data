You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `tests` number of times, each time processing a new set of inputs `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, the output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will be reset for each iteration, and `counter` will be used to track the position in the strings during each test case. After all iterations, `tests` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of which is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function's return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
