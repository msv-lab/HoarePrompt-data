#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 4, `cnt` remains unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It then calculates the number of groups of four identical integers that can be formed from the list `a` and prints this count. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the program prints the count of such groups.
