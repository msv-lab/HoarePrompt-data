Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Constraints Processing**:
   - For each test case, it initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to represent the maximum lower bound and the minimum upper bound, respectively.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Constraint Types**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current value and the new constraint value.
   - For type 2 constraints (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current value and the new constraint value.
   - For type 3 constraints (`a == 3`), it adds the value to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values in the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description, ensuring that it produces the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
