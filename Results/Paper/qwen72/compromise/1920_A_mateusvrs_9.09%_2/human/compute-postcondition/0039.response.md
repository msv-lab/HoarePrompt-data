To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in cx:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of `cx`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `cx` must be a non-empty collection (list, set, etc.). If `cx` is empty, the loop will not run at all.

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2
- `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1
- `cx` contains all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `tmp` is 0

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cx` must be non-empty**: For the loop to execute, `cx` must contain at least one element. This is the critical condition that needs to be adjusted.

### Final State:
The state must ensure that `cx` is non-empty. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `tmp`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0**
