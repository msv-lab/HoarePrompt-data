The code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The values of `a` and `x` are now updated based on the user input. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `t`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1.**
