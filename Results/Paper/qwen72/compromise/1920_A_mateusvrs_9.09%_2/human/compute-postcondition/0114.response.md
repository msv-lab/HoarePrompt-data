Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `bx` is -1, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` remains an empty set. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `{x}`, and `ax` is 1000000007.***
