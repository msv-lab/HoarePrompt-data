Postcondition: **_ is n-1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1. If no `a` was 1, `bx` remains -1. If no `a` was 2, `ax` remains 1000000007. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**
