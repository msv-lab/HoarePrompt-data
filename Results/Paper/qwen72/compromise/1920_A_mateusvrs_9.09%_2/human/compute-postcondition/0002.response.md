The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range, and it starts from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is not explicitly initialized but will start from 0 as per Python's `range` function behavior.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
