The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. Since the initial value of `bx` is -1, `bx` will be updated to `x` if `x` is greater than -1. Otherwise, `bx` remains -1.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is max(x, -1).**
