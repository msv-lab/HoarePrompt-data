Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` contains `x`.***
