Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` remains an empty set. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to 2, `cx` contains `x`, and `ax` is 1000000007.***
