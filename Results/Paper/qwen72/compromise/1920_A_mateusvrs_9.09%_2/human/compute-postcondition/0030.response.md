The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- If `a` is 1 or not 2, `ax` was initially set to 1000000007. After the code executes, `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` was initially set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. After the code executes, `ax` will remain the same because it is already the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.

Therefore, the updated value of `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the original value of `ax`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the original value of `ax`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the original value of `bx` if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `x`.**
