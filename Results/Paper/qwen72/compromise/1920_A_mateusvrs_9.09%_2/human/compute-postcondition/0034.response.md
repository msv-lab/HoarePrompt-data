Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, and `cx` contains all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2.**

### Explanation:
- **`_` is `n-1`:** The loop runs `n` times, so after all iterations, the loop counter `_` will be `n-1`.
- **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2:** The variable `ax` is updated to the minimum value of `x` whenever `a` is 2.
- **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1:** The variable `bx` is updated to the maximum value of `x` whenever `a` is 1.
- **`cx` contains all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2:** The set `cx` collects all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2.

All other variables (`t`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
