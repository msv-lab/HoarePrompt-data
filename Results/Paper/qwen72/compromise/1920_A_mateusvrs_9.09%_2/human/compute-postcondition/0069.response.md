Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the initial value of `ax`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` has been added to the collection `cx`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to `a` and `x`. The initial state conditions regarding `n`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` remain unchanged, except that `a` and `x` now have specific values provided by the user. The conditions for `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` remain as they were in the initial state, depending on the value of `a`.
