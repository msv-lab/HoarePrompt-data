t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x), where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case.
