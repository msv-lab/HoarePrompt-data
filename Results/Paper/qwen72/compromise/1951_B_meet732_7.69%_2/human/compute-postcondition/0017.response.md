Postcondition: **`a` remains a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[14]`; `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, but currently, `ind` contains only one index; `c` is 1, indicating that there is exactly one element in `a` that is greater than `x`; `ind` is not an empty list; the first element of `ind` is not 0; and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
