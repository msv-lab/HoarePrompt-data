Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one of them can be printed.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then printed.

3. **Evaluating the Solution:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `s` is constructed as `s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n`.
     - This means `s` will be a repetition of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `abcbac`.

   - **Subsequence Property:**
     - To check if the constructed string `s` contains all possible strings of length `n` as subsequences, consider the following:
       - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the possible strings are `a` and `b`. The string `s = 'ab'` contains both `a` and `b` as subsequences.
       - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the possible strings are `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`. The string `s = 'baab'` contains all these as subsequences.
       - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the possible strings are `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, and `cc`. The string `s = 'abcbac'` contains all these as subsequences.
     - The constructed string `s` ensures that every possible string of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets is a subsequence because each character from the first `k` alphabets appears at least `n` times in `s`, and the order of characters is preserved.

   - **Optimality:**
     - The length of the constructed string `s` is `k * n`.
     - This length is minimal because each character from the first `k` alphabets must appear at least `n` times to ensure all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
     - Any shorter string would not be able to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.

4. **Challenging the Solution:**
   - The solution constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. This ensures that every possible string of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets is a subsequence.
   - However, the solution does not necessarily generate the shortest possible string. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `abcbac` is valid, but a shorter string `abcabc` would also be valid and contain all required subsequences.
   - The problem statement requires the shortest possible string, and while the current solution is correct, it may not always produce the shortest string.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution correctly constructs a string `s` that satisfies the problem requirements.
   - However, it does not always produce the shortest possible string, which is a requirement of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
