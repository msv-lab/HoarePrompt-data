You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one of them can be printed.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then printed.

3. **Evaluating the Solution:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `s` is constructed as `s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n`.
     - This means `s` will be a repetition of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `abcbac`.

   - **Subsequence Property:**
     - To check if the constructed string `s` contains all possible strings of length `n` as subsequences, consider the following:
       - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the possible strings are `a` and `b`. The string `s = 'ab'` contains both `a` and `b` as subsequences.
       - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the possible strings are `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`. The string `s = 'baab'` contains all these as subsequences.
       - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the possible strings are `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, and `cc`. The string `s = 'abcbac'` contains all these as subsequences.
     - The constructed string `s` ensures that every possible string of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets is a subsequence because each character from the first `k` alphabets appears at least `n` times in `s`, and the order of characters is preserved.

   - **Optimality:**
     - The length of the constructed string `s` is `k * n`.
     - This length is minimal because each character from the first `k` alphabets must appear at least `n` times to ensure all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
     - Any shorter string would not be able to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution correctly constructs a string `s` that satisfies the problem requirements.
   - The string `s` is as short as possible and contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
