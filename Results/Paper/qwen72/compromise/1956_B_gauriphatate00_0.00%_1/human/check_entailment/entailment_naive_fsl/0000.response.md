Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking turns optimally. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand. The number of pairs of cards you have is calculated by summing up the instances where a card appears exactly twice. The function then returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which is the maximum number of points you can get in the game. This is correct because Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, and you can only score a point if Nene has already placed a card with the same number on the table.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end. The input parsing is done efficiently using a single read and splitting the data, which is appropriate for the problem constraints.

The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
