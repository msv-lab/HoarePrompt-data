Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the array length is even. According to the problem description, the median for an even-length array should be the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\), which is the element at index \(\frac{n}{2}\) (0-based index). However, the program uses the element at index \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\) as the median, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 4
arr = [5, 5, 5, 5]
```
The sorted array is `[5, 5, 5, 5]`, and the median should be the element at index \(\lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2\) (0-based index), which is 5. However, the program uses the element at index \(\frac{4}{2} - 1 = 1\), which is also 5, but this is not the correct median index for the problem description. The program will not correctly compute the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median in this case.
