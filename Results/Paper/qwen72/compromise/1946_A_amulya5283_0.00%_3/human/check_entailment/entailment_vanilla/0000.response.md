### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the arrays for each test case.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently reads the input.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program extracts the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It appends the tuple `(n, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part is also correct and correctly prepares the test cases for further processing.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The program sorts the array `arr` to find the median.
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2` (integer division).
   - This is correct for finding the median in a sorted array.

4. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program creates a min-heap from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array.
   - It initializes the `operations` counter to 0.
   - The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly increments the smallest element in the heap until the smallest element is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment is counted as an operation.
   - This part of the logic is correct because it ensures that the smallest element in the heap (which is the median or one of the elements that can become the median) is increased until it is greater than the current median.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the number of operations required for each test case and prints them.
   - This part is correct and ensures the output is in the required format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It handles the input and output efficiently and the heap operations ensure that the smallest element is incremented until the median is increased.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
