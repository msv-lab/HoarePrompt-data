Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index + 2` to the end, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the value at the index `median_index + 2` in `arr`, and `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.**

Explanation: The `smallest` variable is updated to the value at the index `median_index + 2` in `arr` because `heapq.heappop(heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap, which was initially the value at `median_index + 1` in `arr`. The heap now contains elements starting from `median_index + 2` to the end of `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
