The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, which means `t` is already greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as `t` is already a positive integer and `i` will be 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
