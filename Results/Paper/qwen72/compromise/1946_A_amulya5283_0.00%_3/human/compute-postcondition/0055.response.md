Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, but the first element (which was equal to `current_median`) has been removed, `smallest` is the value of `current_median`, `operations` is 0.**
