Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string with at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the third element of `s`, `cnt` is [2, 0] if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is [1, 1], `ans` is 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0], and `cnt[1]` is 0, so `ans` remains 0.
- If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [1, 1], and `cnt[1]` is 1, so `ans` is incremented by 1, making it `zeroes - 1 + 1` which simplifies to `zeroes`.
- Therefore, the value of `ans` is 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise it is `zeroes - 1 + 1` which is `zeroes`.
