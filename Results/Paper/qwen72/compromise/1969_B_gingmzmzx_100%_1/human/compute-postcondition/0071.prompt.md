Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1, otherwise `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element of `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 1 if the first element of `s` is 1, otherwise `cnt[first element of s]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is now `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element of `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 1 if the first element of `s` is 1, otherwise `cnt[first element of s]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 2. If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`. If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
