Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string with at least 2 elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the second element of `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] with the `c`-th element incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, if `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.***
