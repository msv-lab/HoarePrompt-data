Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the product of the number of ones in `s` and the number of zeros in `s` minus the number of zeros encountered so far.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` updates the list `s` to contain the integer digits of the input string.
- The initial state mentions that `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, which remains valid after the code execution.
- The other variables (`n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this code snippet, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
