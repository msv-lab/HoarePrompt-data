Output State: **`n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, `ans` is the total cost of sorting the binary string `s` such that all zeros come before all ones.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` is 0**: After the loop has executed `n` times, the value of `n` is decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- **`s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string**: The variable `s` remains a list of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing the binary string input for each iteration.
- **`zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`**: The variable `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s` for each iteration.
- **`cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`**: The list `cnt` keeps track of the counts of zeros and ones in the list `s` for each iteration.
- **`ans` is the total cost of sorting the binary string `s` such that all zeros come before all ones**: The variable `ans` accumulates the cost of sorting the binary string `s` for each iteration. The cost is calculated by summing the number of zeros that appear after any one in the list `s` and the number of ones that appear before any zero in the list `s`. This effectively represents the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the binary string such that all zeros are at the beginning and all ones are at the end.
