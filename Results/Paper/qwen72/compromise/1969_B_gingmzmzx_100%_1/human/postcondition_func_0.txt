The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers. It then calculates the minimum cost required to sort the binary string `s` such that all zeros come before all ones. The function prints the calculated cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
