### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a binary string `s` and need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring `s_l s_{l+1} ... s_r` moves the last character of the substring to the front and shifts all other characters one position to the right.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring `r - l + 1`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is `0`, it increments the count of zeroes in `cnt` and adds 1 to the answer `ans` if there is at least one `1` before it.
     - If `c` is `1`, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining zeroes to the answer `ans`.

4. **Logic Explanation:**
   - The logic is based on the idea that to sort the string, we need to move all `1`s to the right of all `0`s.
   - For each `0` encountered, if there is at least one `1` before it, we need to perform a cyclic shift to move the `1` to the right of the `0`.
   - For each `1` encountered, we need to move all remaining `0`s to the left of the `1` to sort the string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., `0000`).
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted and requires multiple shifts to sort (e.g., `101011`).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
- The algorithm efficiently calculates the cost by iterating through the string once, making it suitable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
