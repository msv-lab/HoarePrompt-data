### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string such that all zeros come before all ones using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is `0`, it increments the count of zeroes in `cnt` and adds 1 to the answer `ans` if there is at least one `1` before it.
     - If `c` is `1`, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining zeroes to the answer `ans`.

4. **Logic Explanation:**
   - The logic is based on the idea that to sort the string, we need to move all `1`s to the right of all `0`s.
   - For each `0` encountered, if there is at least one `1` before it, we need to perform a cyclic shift to move the `1` to the right of the `0`.
   - For each `1` encountered, we need to move all remaining `0`s to the left of the `1` to sort the string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., `0000`).
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted and requires multiple shifts to sort (e.g., `101011`).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Counting Zeroes:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` using `zeroes = s.count(0)`.

- **Iterating Through the String:**
  - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
  - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
    - If `c` is `0`, it increments the count of zeroes in `cnt` and adds 1 to the answer `ans` if there is at least one `1` before it. This is because each `0` that appears after a `1` needs to be moved to the left of the `1` to sort the string.
    - If `c` is `1`, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining zeroes to the answer `ans`. This is because each `1` that appears before a `0` needs to be moved to the right of the `0` to sort the string.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation is done by summing up the necessary shifts for each character in the string. This approach ensures that the total cost is minimized by considering the optimal shifts for each character.

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the positions where shifts are needed and calculates the cost accordingly.
  - The logic of adding 1 to `ans` for each `0` that appears after a `1` and adding the number of remaining zeroes for each `1` that appears before a `0` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
- The algorithm efficiently calculates the cost by iterating through the string once, making it suitable for the given constraints.

Final: **True**
