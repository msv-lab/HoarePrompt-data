Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b[k]` is not equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, and `j` is `j + x` where `x` is the number of times the loop executed. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `b[j + x]` is not equal to `a[2]` for all `x` such that `j + x < m`, and `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, `b[j + x - 1]` is not equal to `a[2]` for all `x` such that `j + x - 1 < m`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
