Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `j` is `j + x` where `x` is the number of times the loop executed, and `b[j + x - 1]` must not be equal to `a[2]` for all `x` such that `j + x - 1 < m`. Additionally, the current value of `j` is less than `m`.**
