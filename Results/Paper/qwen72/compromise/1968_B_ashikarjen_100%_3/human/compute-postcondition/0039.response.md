Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `j` is `j + 3` and `j` must be less than `m - 2`, `b[j + 2]` must not be equal to `a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j + 3` (since `j` was already `j + 2`).
- The conditions for `n`, `i`, and `b[k]` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `j` must be less than `m - 2` still holds, but `j` is now `j + 3`.
- The condition that `b[j + 2]` must not be equal to `a[2]` remains unchanged, but `j` is now `j + 3`.
