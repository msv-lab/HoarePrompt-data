The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but does not explicitly list the parameters in the function signature. Based on the provided information, the function likely accepts a parameter `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a list `p_i` of four integers. Each integer in `p_i` is constrained such that 0 <= p_i[j] <= 200 for j in [0, 1, 2, 3].

However, since the function signature does not specify these parameters, we can infer that the function might accept a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four integers. The function then processes these test cases and returns a result based on the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four integers (each integer between 0 and 200). It processes each test case and returns a result based on the input values.**
