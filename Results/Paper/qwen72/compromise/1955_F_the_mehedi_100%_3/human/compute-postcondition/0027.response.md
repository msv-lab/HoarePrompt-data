The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than the integer value provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and the integer value from `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of `a` are all odd) and the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
