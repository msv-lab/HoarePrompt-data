Output State: **`_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the new `a` are all odd) and the floor division of each element in the new `a` by 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `_` remains unchanged.
- The value of `a` is now a list of integers derived from the new input provided by `input().split()`.
- The value of `cnt` is recalculated based on the new list `a`. It is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the new `a` are all odd) and the floor division of each element in the new `a` by 2.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
