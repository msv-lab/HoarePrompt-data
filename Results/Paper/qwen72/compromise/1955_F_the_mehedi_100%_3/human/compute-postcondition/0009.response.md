Output State: **`_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from a positive integer input greater than 0 and must have at least two elements, `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2) if the first three elements of `a` are odd integers, otherwise `cnt` is math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2), `x` is the second element of `a`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`.
- If the first three elements of `a` are odd integers, `cnt` was initially `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`, so now it is `1 + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`.
- Otherwise, `cnt` was initially `math.floor(x / 2)`, so now it is `math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`.
- The values of `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
