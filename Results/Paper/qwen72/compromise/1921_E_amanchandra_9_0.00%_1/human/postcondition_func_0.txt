The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. For each test case, it determines and prints one of three possible outcomes: "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob". The outcome is based on the relative positions of `x_a` and `x_b` and the distances between `y_a` and `y_b` within the bounds defined by `h` and `w`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case. The function does not return any value.
