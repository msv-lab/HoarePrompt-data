### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Draw:**
   - The program first checks if `x_a` (Alice's row) is greater than `x_b` (Bob's row). If this is the case, the game will end in a draw because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row, and Alice cannot move down to Bob's row. This is a correct initial check.

2. **Odd and Even Differences:**
   - The program then calculates the difference `x` between `x_a` and `x_b` and determines if this difference is odd or even.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice has the advantage because she can make the last move to potentially capture Bob's chip. The program checks if Alice can move her chip to a position where it can overlap with Bob's chip.
   - If the difference is even, Bob has the advantage because he can make the last move to potentially capture Alice's chip. The program checks if Bob can move his chip to a position where it can overlap with Alice's chip.

3. **Position Calculation:**
   - For odd differences, the program calculates the range of possible columns (`l` and `r`) where Alice can move her chip. It then checks if Alice's current column `y_a` is within this range.
   - For even differences, the program calculates the range of possible columns (`l` and `r`) where Bob can move his chip. It then checks if Bob's current column `y_b` is within this range.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Draw" if the conditions for a win are not met.
   - It prints "Alice" if Alice can move her chip to overlap with Bob's chip.
   - It prints "Bob" if Bob can move his chip to overlap with Alice's chip.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Odd Difference Case:**
  - The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` and checks if `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. This is intended to check if Alice can move her chip to a position where it can overlap with Bob's chip.
  - However, the logic for calculating `l` and `r` is not entirely correct. `l` should be `max(1, yb - x - 1)` and `r` should be `min(w, yb + x + 1)` to account for the diagonal moves correctly.

- **Even Difference Case:**
  - The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` and checks if `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`. This is intended to check if Bob can move his chip to a position where it can overlap with Alice's chip.
  - However, the logic for calculating `l` and `r` is not entirely correct. `l` should be `max(1, ya - x - 1)` and `r` should be `min(w, yb + x + 1)` to account for the diagonal moves correctly.

### Correctness:
- The program has logical errors in the calculation of the possible ranges for Alice and Bob's moves. These errors can lead to incorrect outcomes in some test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the possible ranges for Alice and Bob's moves, leading to potential incorrect outcomes.
