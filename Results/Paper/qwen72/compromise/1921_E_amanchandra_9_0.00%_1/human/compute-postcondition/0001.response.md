Output State: **The loop will execute the specified number of times, processing each set of six integers (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) and printing either "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob" based on the conditions provided. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` will be updated with each iteration to reflect the next set of input values, but their final values will be the last set of inputs processed by the loop. The loop counter `i` will have the value equal to the number of test cases minus one after the loop finishes.**
