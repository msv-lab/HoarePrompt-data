The function `func` is designed to be called with no arguments, but it is implied that it processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. These integers must satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. Additionally, the sum of `h` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case. The exact return value is not specified, but it is implied that the function will handle the test cases and return an appropriate output for each.**
