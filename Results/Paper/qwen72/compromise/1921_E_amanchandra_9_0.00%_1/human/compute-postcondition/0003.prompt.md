You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that it should be called with multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. These integers must satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. Additionally, the sum of h over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <=
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop will execute the specified number of times, processing each set of six integers (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) and printing either "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob" based on the conditions provided. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` will be updated with each iteration to reflect the next set of input values, but their final values will be the last set of inputs processed by the loop. The loop counter `i` will have the value equal to the number of test cases minus one after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each with six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case. The exact return value is not specified, but it is implied that the function will handle the test cases and return an appropriate output for each.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
