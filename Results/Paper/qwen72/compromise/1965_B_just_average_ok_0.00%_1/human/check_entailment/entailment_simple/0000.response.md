Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2, which are `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ..., 2^23]`. This list is used to ensure that all numbers from 1 to `2^24 - 1` can be formed as a sum of some subsequence of `nums`.
   - The function then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it from `nums`. This is done using the `while` loop and the `idx` variable. The `while` loop continues to increment `idx` until `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is greater than `k`. Then `idx` is decremented by 1 to point to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - The function appends three new elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence because the removed `1 << idx` was the only way to form `k` using the powers of 2.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed as a sum of a subsequence.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed as a sum of a subsequence.
   - The function then removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of `nums` and then the elements of `nums`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The sequence `nums` is designed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as a subsequence.
   - The length of `nums` is always 26 (24 initial elements + 3 new elements - 1 removed element), which is within the allowed limit of 25 elements. However, this is a mistake because the problem specifies that the sequence size should be at most 25, but the function always outputs 26 elements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly by ensuring that the sequence `nums` is constructed in such a way that the conditions are met for all valid inputs.

Given the above reasoning, the function is almost correct but violates the constraint that the sequence size should be at most 25. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
