### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This ensures that `nums` contains 24 elements, each of which is a unique power of 2. These elements can be used to form any sum from 0 to \(2^{24} - 1\) (which is 16,777,215) by selecting a subset of these elements.

2. **Finding the Index**:
   - The loop `while k >= 1 << idx` finds the highest index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \le k\). This is used to identify the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums` to ensure that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k`.
   - Three new elements are added to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum of `k` cannot be formed because the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of `nums` is printed, followed by the elements of `nums`. The length of `nums` will be 26 because it initially has 24 elements, one is removed, and three are added.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program ensures that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k` by removing the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - The program ensures that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by adding the three new elements and keeping the rest of the powers of 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. It ensures that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be formed. The modifications to `nums` are done in a way that maintains the required properties.
