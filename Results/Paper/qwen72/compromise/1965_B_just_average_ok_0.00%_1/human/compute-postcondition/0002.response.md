The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function processes up to 1000 test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. The function returns the result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.
