The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. 

Given the problem description, the function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, and the number of test cases can be up to 1000. Therefore, the input should be a positive integer within this range.

State: **`int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ 1000)**
