You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_islands(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The function `min_islands` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop has executed all iterations, and for each iteration, it has printed `n` if `n - k <= 1`, otherwise it has printed `1`. The values of `n` and `k` for each iteration are determined by the user input, and these values are not retained after the loop. The loop itself does not modify the function definition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `n` represents the number of islands and `k` represents the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. For each pair, it prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints `1`. The function does not return any value and does not retain the input values after each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have \( n \) islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can visit.
   - Everule starts on island 1 and can visit any island that is still connected to island 1 through a series of bridges.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( k \) is 0, no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.
   - If \( k \) is large enough to destroy all bridges, Everule will be isolated on island 1 and can only visit 1 island.
   - For intermediate values of \( k \), the goal is to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Dominater:**
   - To minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, Dominater should focus on isolating island 1 from as many other islands as possible.
   - The maximum number of bridges connected to island 1 is \( n - 1 \) (one bridge to each of the other \( n - 1 \) islands).
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it completely.
   - If \( k < n - 1 \), Dominater can destroy \( k \) bridges, leaving \( n - 1 - k \) bridges connected to island 1. Everule can still visit \( n - k \) islands, including island 1.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then prints \( n \) if \( n - k \leq 1 \), otherwise it prints 1.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \). The program should print \( n - k \) if \( k < n - 1 \), and 1 if \( k \geq n - 1 \).

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), print 1 (Everule can only visit island 1).
   - If \( k < n - 1 \), print \( n - k \) (Everule can visit \( n - k \) islands, including island 1).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \). It should print \( n - k \) in that case, not \( n \).
