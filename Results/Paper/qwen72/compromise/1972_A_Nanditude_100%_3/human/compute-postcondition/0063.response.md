The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1 if `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, or 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`. After incrementing, `i` will be 2 if `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, or 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is 2, `cnt` is 0 if `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]` and `i` is 2; otherwise, `cnt` is 2 and `i` is 1.**
