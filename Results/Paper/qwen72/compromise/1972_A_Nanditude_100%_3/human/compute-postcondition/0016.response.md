Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `cnt` is 0 or 1. If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 or 1.***
