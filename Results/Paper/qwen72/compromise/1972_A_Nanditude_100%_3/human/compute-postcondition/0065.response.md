Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`, and `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are greater than or equal to `a[i]` before the loop started, or `n` if all elements in `b` are less than `a[i]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `n` remains the length of the list `b`, which is greater than 0.
- The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- The variable `_` is incremented by `n` and must still be less than `t`.
- The variable `j` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
- The variable `cnt` will count the number of elements in `b` that are less than the element `a[i]`.
- The variable `i` will be the index in `a` that indicates how many elements in `b` are greater than or equal to `a[i]` before the loop started, or `n` if all elements in `b` are less than `a[i]`.
