Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial state specified that `a` was a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, but after this code snippet, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged.
