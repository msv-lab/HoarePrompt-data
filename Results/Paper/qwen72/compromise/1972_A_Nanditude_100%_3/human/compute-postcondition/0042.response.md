Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` < `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `b[j]` < `a[i]` after the increment, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
