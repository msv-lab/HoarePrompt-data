Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, b is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b` or the length of `a` if all elements in `a` are less than the elements in `b`, `j` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`, and `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b` or `n` if all elements in `a` are less than the corresponding elements in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`, and `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are greater than or equal to `a[i]` before the loop started, or `n` if all elements in `b` are less than `a[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
