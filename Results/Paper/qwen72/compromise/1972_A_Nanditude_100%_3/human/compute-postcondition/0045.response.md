The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used to control the number of iterations of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by `n`, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

Given that `_` is incremented by `n` at the end of each iteration, the next value of `_` will be `_ + n`. For the loop to execute again, `_ + n` must be less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`, and `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b` or `n` if all elements in `a` are less than the corresponding elements in `b`.**

Simplified:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is `n-1`, `cnt` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged.**
