Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length and at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, and `vt` is 0 or 1. If `a[i]` == `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the string representation of the smaller or larger digit (depending on the value of `vt`) concatenated with the second character of `a`, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement. If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, `x` is the smaller of the second digits of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger of the second digits of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated to include the previous value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated to include the previous value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to include the digit `y` appended to its previous value, and `kq2` is updated to include the digit `x` appended to its previous value.***
