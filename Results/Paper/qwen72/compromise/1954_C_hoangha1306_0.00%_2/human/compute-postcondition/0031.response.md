Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 2 characters; `kq1` is the original `kq1` string concatenated with the second character of `a`; `kq2` is the original `kq2` string concatenated with the second character of `a`; `i` is 1. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
