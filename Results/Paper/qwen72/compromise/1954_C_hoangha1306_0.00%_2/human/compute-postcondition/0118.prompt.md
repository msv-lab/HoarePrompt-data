Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is an input string with the same length as the previous `a`; `b` is an input string with the same length as `a`; `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `kq1` is an empty string. `kq2` is an empty string. `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 1, `i` is 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the first characters of `a` and `b`. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `y` is the maximum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, and `kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the comparison of the first characters of `a` and `b`: if the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` are both updated to include the second character of `a` appended to their previous values, and `vt` remains 0. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `y` is the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, and `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`: if `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` includes the string representation of `x` appended to its previous value, and `kq2` includes the string representation of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` includes the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` includes the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was initially 0, it is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 3, `i` is 2, `vt` is 1 if the second characters of `a` and `b` were different, otherwise `vt` remains 0. If `a[2]` == `b[2]`, `kq1` includes the third character of `a`, and `kq2` includes the third character of `a` appended to its previous value. If `a[2]` != `b[2]`, `x` is the smaller of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` == 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `a[2]` and `b[2]`: if `a[2]` > `b[2]`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(x)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`. If `vt` != 0, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
