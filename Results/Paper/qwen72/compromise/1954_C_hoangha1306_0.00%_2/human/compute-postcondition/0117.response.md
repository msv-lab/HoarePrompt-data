Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 3, `i` is 2, `vt` is 1 if the second characters of `a` and `b` were different, otherwise `vt` remains 0. If `a[2]` == `b[2]`, `kq1` includes the third character of `a`, and `kq2` includes the third character of `a` appended to its previous value. If `a[2]` != `b[2]`, `x` is the smaller of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` == 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `a[2]` and `b[2]`: if `a[2]` > `b[2]`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(x)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`. If `vt` != 0, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`.**
