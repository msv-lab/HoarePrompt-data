Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is an input string with the same length as the previous `a`; `b` is an input string with the same length as `a`; `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `kq1` is an empty string. `kq2` is a string that has been constructed by comparing each corresponding character of `a` and `b`. For each character position, if the characters are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` were concatenated with that character. If the characters are different, `kq1` was concatenated with the larger of the two characters (or the smaller one if `vt` was initially 0 and the first differing character in `a` was less than the corresponding character in `b`), and `kq2` was concatenated with the smaller of the two characters (or the larger one if `vt` was initially 0 and the first differing character in `a` was less than the corresponding character in `b`). `vt` is 1 if there was at least one position where the characters in `a` and `b` differed and `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `vt` remains 0.**
