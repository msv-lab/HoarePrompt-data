Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is 1, `vt` is 1, `x` is the smaller of the second digits of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the second digits of `a` and `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- `kq2` is now a string that includes the previous value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`.
