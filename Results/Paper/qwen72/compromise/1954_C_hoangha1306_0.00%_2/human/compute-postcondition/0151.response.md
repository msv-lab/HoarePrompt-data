Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is 1, `vt` is 0 or 1, `kq1` is the string representation of the smaller or larger digit (depending on the value of `vt`) concatenated with the second character of `a`, `kq2` is the string representation of the larger or smaller digit (depending on the value of `vt`) concatenated with the second and third characters of `a`. The `continue` statement is executed, so the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop.**
