Output State: **t is an input integer, x and y are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.**

Explanation:
- `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` now holds an integer value provided by the user.
- The values of `x` and `y` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
