The only variables in the loop head are `tickets_bought` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `tickets_bought` and `k`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)). Since `tickets_bought` is 0 and `k` is at least 1, the loop will certainly execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)), `prices` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `pq` is now a heap containing the same elements as the original list of tuples, where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**
