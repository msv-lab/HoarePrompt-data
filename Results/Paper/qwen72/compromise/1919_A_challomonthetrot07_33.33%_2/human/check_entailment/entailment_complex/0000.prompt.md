Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should either be called in a loop or modified to accept a list of tuples (a, b) as input.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `T` times, and for each iteration, it will read a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it will print either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The variables `a` and `b` will be updated with the new input values for each iteration, and the loop will continue until all `T` iterations are completed. After the loop finishes, the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and `T` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `T` test cases, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' to the console according to the following conditions: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` equals 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` equals 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all `T` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, and the final state of the program includes the last pair of integers read from the input for `a` and `b`, and the value of `T` remains unchanged.
