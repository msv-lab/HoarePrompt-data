Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the case where `a = 2` and `b = 2`. According to the problem description, both wallets start with the same number of coins, and since both players play optimally, the game should end in a draw or Bob should win because the players will eventually run out of coins simultaneously. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this case. 

Another incorrect case is when `a = 2` and `b = 3`. The program outputs "Alice" because it checks if `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`, but this is not always correct. If both players play optimally, Bob can force a win by always swapping wallets when Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, ensuring that Alice is the one who eventually cannot make a move.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly determine the winner for all possible inputs.
