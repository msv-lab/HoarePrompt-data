The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `T` test cases, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' to the console according to the following conditions: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` equals 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` equals 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all `T` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, and the final state of the program includes the last pair of integers read from the input for `a` and `b`, and the value of `T` remains unchanged.
