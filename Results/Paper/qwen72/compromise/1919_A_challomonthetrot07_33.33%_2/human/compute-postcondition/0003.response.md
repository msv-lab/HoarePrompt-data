The function `func` is designed to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers with the constraint that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, either by being called in a loop or by being modified to accept a list of tuples (a, b) as input. However, the provided function signature does not specify any parameters, so we need to assume the function is modified to accept a list of tuples (a, b).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples (a, b), where each tuple contains two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. For each tuple, the function returns a result based on the values of a and b.**
