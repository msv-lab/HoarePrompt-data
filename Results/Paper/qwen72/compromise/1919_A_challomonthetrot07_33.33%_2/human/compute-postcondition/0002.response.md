Output State: **The loop will execute `T` times, and for each iteration, it will read a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it will print either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The variables `a` and `b` will be updated with the new input values for each iteration, and the loop will continue until all `T` iterations are completed. After the loop finishes, the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and `T` will remain unchanged.**
