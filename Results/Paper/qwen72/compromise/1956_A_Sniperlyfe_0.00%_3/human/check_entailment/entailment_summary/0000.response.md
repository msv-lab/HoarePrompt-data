### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: `n` (number of players) and `p` (list of positions to kick out).
   - **Behavior**: The function iterates while `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`. In each iteration, it decreases `n` by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This simulates the rounds of the game where players at positions specified in `p` are removed.
   - **Output**: The function returns the number of players remaining after all rounds, which is the number of winners.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly implements the logic of the game as described. It ensures that players are removed in each round until no more players can be removed, and then it returns the number of remaining players.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: The function reads input from the user, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of positions `k`, the number of queries `q`, the list of positions `p`, and the list of queries `qs`.
   - **Behavior**: For each test case, it processes each query `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. It then prints the results of all queries for the current test case.
   - **Output**: The function prints the results of `func_1` for each query in `qs` for each test case.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. However, there is a minor issue in the code: the `print` statement is inside the loop that processes each query, which means it prints the results after each query is processed, rather than after all queries for a test case are processed.

### Correctness:
- **Function `func_1`**: The logic is correct and matches the problem description.
- **Function `func_2`**: The logic is mostly correct, but the `print` statement should be outside the loop that processes each query to ensure that all results for a test case are printed together.

### Conclusion:
- The program is **almost correct** but has a minor issue with the placement of the `print` statement in `func_2`. To fix this, the `print` statement should be moved outside the loop that processes each query.

### Correctness: **False**

To make the program correct, the `func_2` function should be modified as follows:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

This ensures that the results for each test case are printed together after all queries are processed.
