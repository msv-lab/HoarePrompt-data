To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the first integer in `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is converting each element of the list `res` to a string using `map(str, res)`.
   - It then joins these string elements with a space `' '` to form a single string.
   - Finally, it prints this single string.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - `res` is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `qs`.
   - The exact values of `res` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `n` and `p`.

Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the values that `func_1` returns based on the inputs `n` and `p`.

**Output:**
Output: **' '.join(map(str, res)) (where res is the result of func_1(n, p), n is the first integer in qs, and p is the list of integers provided by the user)**

This means the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in the list `res`, which is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the first integer in `qs` and the list `p`. The exact values of `res` depend on the specific implementation of `func_1`.
