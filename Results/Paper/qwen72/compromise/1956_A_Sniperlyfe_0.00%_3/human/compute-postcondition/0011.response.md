Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 integers.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the second integer in `qs`.
   - `res` now contains an additional element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

2. **Understanding the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`.
   - This statement converts each element in the list `res` to a string, joins them with a space, and prints the resulting string.

3. **Determining the Values**:
   - `res` initially contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the second integer in the list `qs`.
   - After the initial state, `res` has an additional element appended to it, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Since `res` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the `print` statement will output these two results separated by a space.

Given the initial state and the structure of the `print` statement, the output will be the two results of `func_1(n, p)` separated by a space. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1` and the values of `p` and `qs`, we can't determine the exact numerical values of these results.

Output: **[result1] [result2] (where result1 and result2 are the results of func_1(n, p) and n is the second integer in the list qs)**
