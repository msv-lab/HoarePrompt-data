Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least `len(qs)` elements, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variables `k` and `q` remain as input integers.
- The list `p` remains unchanged as the list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `qs` must have at least as many elements as it had initially.
- The list `res` contains the results of the function `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in the list `qs`. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `func_1` applied to the respective element in `qs`.
