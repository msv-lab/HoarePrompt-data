Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice.
   - `n` is the second element in `qs`.

2. **Understanding the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`.
   - This statement converts each element in the list `res` to a string, joins them with a space, and prints the resulting string.

3. **Analyzing the `res` List**:
   - `res` is defined as a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice.
   - `n` is the second element in the list `qs`.
   - Therefore, `res` will contain two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `res` contains two identical elements, the `print` statement will output these two elements separated by a space.
   - The exact value of `func_1(n, p)` is not provided, so we can only describe it in terms of the function and its inputs.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be the result of `func_1(n, p)` printed twice, separated by a space.
   - The value of `n` is the second element in the list `qs`.

Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p) (where n is the second element in the list `qs` and `func_1(n, p)` is the result of the function `func_1` with inputs `n` and `p`)**
