Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement will convert each element of the list `res` to a string using `map(str, res)`.
   - It will then join these string elements with a space `' '` as the separator.
   - Finally, it will print the resulting string.

4. **Determine the Values**:
   - `res` is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element of `qs`.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's result.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the elements of `res` as a space-separated string.
   - The exact values of the elements in `res` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `n` and `p`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in the list `res`, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **' '.join(map(str, res)) (where res is the result of func_1(n, p) and n is the first element of the list qs)**
