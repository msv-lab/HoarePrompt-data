Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the first integer in `qs`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is the first integer in the list `qs`.
- The function `func_1(n, p)` is called with `n` and the list `p` as arguments.
- The result of `func_1(n, p)` is appended to the list `res`.
- The states of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged.
- The list `res` now contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
