Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 1.
2. `k` is an input integer.
3. `q` is an input integer.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements.
6. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended twice.
7. `n` is the third element of `qs`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`qs` List**: Since `qs` is a list provided by the user and must have at least 3 elements, let's denote the elements of `qs` as `qs[0]`, `qs[1]`, and `qs[2]` (and possibly more). The third element of `qs` is `qs[2]`, which is assigned to `n`.

2. **`func_1(n, p)`**: This function is called with `n` (the third element of `qs`) and `p` (the list of integers provided by the user). The result of this function is appended to the list `res` twice. Therefore, `res` will contain two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **`res` List**: After the function calls, `res` will look like `[func_1(n, p), func_1(n, p)]`.

4. **`print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`**: This line converts each element of `res` to a string using `map(str, res)` and then joins these strings with a space in between using `' '.join()`. The final result is printed.

### Output Calculation:
- `n` is the third element of `qs`.
- `func_1(n, p)` is called and its result is appended to `res` twice.
- The `print` statement will output the string representation of the elements in `res` separated by a space.

Since the exact values of `n` and `p` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical result of `func_1(n, p)`. However, we know that `res` will contain two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **result result (where result is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the third element of the `qs` list)**
