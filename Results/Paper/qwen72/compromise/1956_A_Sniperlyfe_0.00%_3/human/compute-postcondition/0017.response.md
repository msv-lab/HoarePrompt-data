Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs`**

The values of `k` and `q` are updated to the integers provided by the user through the `input().split()` method. The other variables (`t`, `p`, `qs`, `res`) remain unchanged.
