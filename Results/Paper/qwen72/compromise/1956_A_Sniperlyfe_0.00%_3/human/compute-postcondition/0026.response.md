Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 1.
2. `k` is an input integer.
3. `q` is an input integer.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements.
6. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
7. `n` is the second element of `qs`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n`**:
   - `n` is the second element of the list `qs`. Since `qs` must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a valid integer.

2. **Understanding `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is called twice with the same arguments: `n` and `p`.
   - The result of `func_1(n, p)` is appended to the list `res` twice.
   - Therefore, `res` will contain two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is a list with two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - Let's denote the result of `func_1(n, p)` as `result_value`.

4. **Understanding the `print` statement**:
   - The `print` statement uses `' '.join(map(str, res))` to convert the elements of `res` to strings and join them with a space.
   - Since `res` contains two identical elements, the output will be two identical strings separated by a space.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, separated by a space. Since the exact value of `func_1(n, p)` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the function's result.

Output: **result_value result_value (where result_value is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the second element of the list `qs`)**
