Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `n` is the second element in `qs`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `res` already contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` from the initial state, it now contains this result twice. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged.
