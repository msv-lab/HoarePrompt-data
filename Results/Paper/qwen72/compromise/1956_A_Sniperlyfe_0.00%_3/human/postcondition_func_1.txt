The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `k` and `q` from the input, followed by a list `p` of `k` integers and a list `qs` of `q` integers. It then processes each integer `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all integers in `qs`, it prints the contents of `res` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is a positive integer, `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of `k` integers in strictly increasing order, `qs` is a list of `q` integers, and `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs` for all `t` iterations.
