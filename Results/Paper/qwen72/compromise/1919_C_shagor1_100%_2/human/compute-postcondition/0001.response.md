The function `func_1` is expected to accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. The function should be called multiple times within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and `a` is a list of integers of size `n` where each element `a_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. It processes the list and returns a result based on the elements of `a`. The function is called multiple times within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and `a` is a list of integers of size `n` where each element `a_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
