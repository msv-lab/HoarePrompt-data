The function `func_1` is currently a placeholder and does not perform any actions. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The function's intended purpose, based on the annotations, is to process a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list, but this is not reflected in the actual code. After the function concludes, the program state remains unchanged.
