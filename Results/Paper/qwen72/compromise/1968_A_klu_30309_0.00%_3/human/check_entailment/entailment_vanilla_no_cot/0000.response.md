Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct for the given problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to find the integer `y` (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.

3. **Logic**:
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1.
   - It iterates over possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 2.
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`).
   - If `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y >= x`, it immediately returns `y` because this `y` will maximize `gcd(x, y) + y` under the given condition.
   - If no such `y` is found, it updates `max_val` to the current `y` and continues the loop.
   - Finally, it returns `max_val`.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The program efficiently finds the largest `y` that divides `x` and checks if `2 * y >= x` to ensure the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `x = 2`, the program correctly returns `1` because `1` is the only valid `y` and `gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2` is the maximum possible value.
   - For other values of `x`, the program iterates from `x-1` down to 2, ensuring it finds the largest `y` that divides `x` and satisfies the condition.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
