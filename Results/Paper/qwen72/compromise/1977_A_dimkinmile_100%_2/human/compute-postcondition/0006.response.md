The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem statement. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
