Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. This means that for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should satisfy the condition:
\[ \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \]

To achieve this, the program uses the following approach:
1. **func_1**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. It is used to find the LCM of all the multipliers \(k_i\) in the list `vals`.
2. **func_2**: This function reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the list of multipliers `vals`. It then calculates the LCM of all the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets \(x_i\).

The key steps in `func_2` are:
- Calculate the LCM of all the multipliers in `vals`.
- Compute the product of the LCM and the reciprocal of each multiplier to get the bets \(x_i\).
- Check if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, print the bets. Otherwise, print `-1`.

Let's break down the logic:
- The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are integers and that the total sum of bets is a multiple of the LCM.
- The bets \(x_i\) are calculated as \( \text{LCM} // k_i \). This ensures that the amount received back for each winning outcome is \( k_i \cdot (\text{LCM} // k_i) = \text{LCM} \).
- The condition to check is whether the sum of the bets is strictly less than the LCM. If it is, then the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, satisfying the problem's requirement.

However, there is a mistake in the function `func_2`:
- The function calculates the LCM of all the multipliers, but it should actually calculate the LCM of the multipliers minus one. This is because the condition requires the total sum of bets to be strictly less than the LCM, not equal to it.

To correct this, the function should calculate the LCM of the multipliers minus one and then use this LCM to determine the bets. Here is the corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0] - 1
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x - 1)
    vprod = [den // (r - 1) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

Given the current implementation, the program will not always produce the correct output because it does not account for the requirement that the total sum of bets must be strictly less than the LCM of the multipliers.

Therefore, the current program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
