Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD). The LCM is used to find a common denominator for the bets.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function handles each test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier.
   - It iterates through the multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier. This ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - It calculates the bets for each outcome as `den // r` where `r` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - It calculates the total amount of coins bet, `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - If the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than `den`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The logic ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which satisfies the problem's requirements. The constraints and the nature of the LCM calculation ensure that the solution is feasible and within the given limits.
