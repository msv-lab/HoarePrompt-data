### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount of coins bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.

2. **Approach**:
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to determine the bets.
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is calculated using the `func_1` function, which computes the LCM of two numbers.
   - The LCM is then divided by each `k_i` to get the bet amounts `vprod[i]`.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `den - sum(vprod)`, where `den` is the LCM.
   - If the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome, the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`. This is correct.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function processes each test case.
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
     - It initializes `den` to the first multiplier.
     - It iterates through the multipliers, updating `den` to the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier.
     - It calculates the bet amounts `vprod` by dividing `den` by each multiplier.
     - It checks if the total amount of coins bet (`den - sum(vprod)`) is strictly less than the total amount of coins received back for any outcome.
     - If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The LCM approach ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total amount of coins bet is minimized while still meeting the condition.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
