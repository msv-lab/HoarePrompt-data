Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` remains the same (though its value is not specified, it is not used in the code snippet).
   - `vals` remains the same (though its exact values are not specified, it is a list of integers).
   - `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of the original `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `den` is calculated as the GCD of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `den / vals[i]` for each `i` in the range of `vals`.
   - Given that `den` is less than or equal to 0, we need to consider what this implies for the values in `vprod`.

3. **Implications:**
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, then `den / vals[i]` for any positive integer `vals[i]` will result in a non-positive value (either 0 or a negative value).
   - Since `den` is used to calculate `vprod`, and `den` is non-positive, the elements in `vprod` will also be non-positive.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The GCD of all elements in `vals` is a positive integer (assuming `vals` contains at least one non-zero element).
   - Subtracting the sum of `vprod` (which is a list of non-positive values) from a positive GCD will result in a value that is less than or equal to the GCD.
   - Given that `den` is already less than or equal to 0, the only way this can be consistent is if `den` is 0 (since GCD is positive and sum of non-positive values is non-positive).

5. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(-1)`.
   - This statement will always print `-1` regardless of the values of `N`, `vals`, `den`, or `vprod`.

Output: **-1**
