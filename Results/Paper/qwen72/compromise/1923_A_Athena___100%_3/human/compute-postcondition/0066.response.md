The first element of the list `a` is removed using the `pop(0)` method. Since the first element of `a` was 0, the list `a` now starts with its second element. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers without the first element (0), `i` is undefined, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0**
