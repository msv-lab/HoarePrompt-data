Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context that handles multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip), and at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is the index of the last element of `a`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). It then removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` and counts the number of zeros remaining in the list. The function prints the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that all test cases have been processed, and the counts of zeros for each test case have been printed.
