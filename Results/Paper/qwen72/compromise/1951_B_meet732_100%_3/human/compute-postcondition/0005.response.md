Postcondition: **`a` remains a list of n integers where each integer a_i represents the Cowdeforces rating of cow i, with all a_i being distinct. `x` is equal to `a[k]`, where `a[k]` is the Cowdeforces rating of the k-th cow. `ind` is an empty list, indicating that there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`. `c` is 0, as there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.**
