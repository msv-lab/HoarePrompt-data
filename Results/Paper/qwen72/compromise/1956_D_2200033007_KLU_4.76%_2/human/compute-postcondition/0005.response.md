The provided `print` statement is a formatted string that explicitly prints the values '13' and '0'. These values are not dependent on the initial state or any variables defined in the precondition.

- The value '13' is a constant string.
- The value '0' is also a constant string.

The `print` statement does not use any variables or objects from the initial state, so the output will be exactly as specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **13 0**
