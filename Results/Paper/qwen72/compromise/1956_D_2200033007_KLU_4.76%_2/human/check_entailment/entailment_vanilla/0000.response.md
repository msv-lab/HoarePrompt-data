Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads a string of space-separated integers, splits the string into individual elements, and appends them to the list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take one parameter `c`, which is the length of the array.
   - The function checks if `c` (the length of the array) is 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the case where the array has exactly two elements, as shown in the first example.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints the output `13 0`. This is the correct output for the case where the array has three elements, as shown in the second example.

4. **Output**:
   - For `c == 2`, the output `4 1` and `1 2` is correct because the MEX of the array `[0, 1]` is `2`, and setting both elements to `2` results in the array `[2, 2]` with a sum of `4`.
   - For `c != 2`, the output `13 0` is correct for the specific case where the array is `[1, 3, 9]` because the sum of the elements is already `13` and no operations are needed.

However, the program is **not** correct for all possible inputs. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the array length is 2 or 3, and it does not handle other lengths (e.g., 1, 4, 5, etc.). Additionally, it does not compute the MEX for the array or perform the operations to maximize the sum for arrays of other lengths.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** because it does not solve the problem for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
