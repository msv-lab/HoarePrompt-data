Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Output for General Cases**:
   - The program only handles the case where the array length is 2 correctly. For any other length, it outputs `13 0` which is not the correct solution for most inputs. The example provided for `n = 3` and `n = 4` clearly show that the maximum sum and the operations required are different from `13 0`.

2. **No MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not calculate the MEX of any subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem. The MEX is used to determine the value to set for the chosen subarray.

3. **No Operation Simulation**:
   - The program does not simulate the operations described in the problem. It does not modify the array based on the MEX value of chosen subarrays.

4. **No General Solution**:
   - The program lacks a general solution that can handle any array length and any array values within the given constraints.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
- Calculate the MEX of subarrays.
- Simulate the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
- Ensure the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

Here is a more detailed approach to solving the problem correctly:

1. **Calculate the MEX**:
   - For a given subarray, the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray.

2. **Simulate Operations**:
   - Use a greedy approach to maximize the sum by choosing subarrays that can be replaced with the highest possible MEX value.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

A correct solution would involve more complex logic and is not trivial to implement in a few lines of code. The provided program is too simplistic and does not address the core requirements of the problem.
