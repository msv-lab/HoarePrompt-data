### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Inside `func_1`, the program initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and increments the count for each integer in `freq`.

3. **Optimal MEX Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a counter `cou` to 0.
   - It iterates through the `freq` list from index 0 to `n`.
   - If the frequency of an integer `i` is 2 or more, it continues to the next iteration.
   - If the frequency of an integer `i` is 1, it increments the counter `cou`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if the frequency of an integer `i` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`.
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX by checking the frequency of each integer from 0 to `n`:
     - If an integer `i` has a frequency of 0, it means `i` is not in the array `c`, and thus it is the MEX.
     - If an integer `i` has a frequency of 1, it means `i` is in the array `c` but only once. The program counts such integers and prints the second one, which is the correct MEX in this context.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr` by correctly printing `n` as the MEX.
   - The program also handles the case where some integers are missing by correctly identifying the smallest missing integer.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The states and the logic are consistent with the problem description and the expected output.
