Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each element in the array `arr` and stores it in the list `freq`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program then iterates through the frequencies to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` that Alice and Bob will construct. The logic is as follows:
   - If an element `i` appears at least twice in `arr`, it can be ignored because both Alice and Bob can ensure it will be in `c` by the end of the game.
   - If an element `i` appears exactly once, it is counted (`cou += 1`).
   - If two elements appear exactly once (`cou == 2`) or if an element `i` does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`), the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`, and by the time `cou` reaches 2, Alice and Bob will have ensured that the first two unique elements are in `c`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the MEX for each test case, which is the correct output based on the optimal play strategy for both Alice and Bob.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
