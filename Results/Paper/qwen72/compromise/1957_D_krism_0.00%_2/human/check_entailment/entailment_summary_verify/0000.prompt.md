You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` is intended to process a list of integers `arr` of length `n` by computing a cumulative XOR prefix list and using it to calculate a final result `ans`. The function reads `n` and `arr` from user input, constructs a `prefix` list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, and initializes two lists `pre` and `suf` to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s at each bit position (0 to 31) in the `prefix` list. It then iterates through `arr` to update `pre` and `suf` and calculates `ans` based on the product of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position. The function prints the `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `suf`, and the final `ans` value. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `t` or `test_cases` (which are not used within the function). The final state of the program includes the printed outputs and the updated `pre` and `suf` lists, with `suf` containing all zeros.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples \((x, y, z)\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n\) and \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

The main issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of valid tuples. The program uses a prefix XOR array and tries to count the number of valid tuples based on the bit positions of the elements. However, the logic used to count the valid tuples is flawed and does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
6 2 4
```
The expected output is 4, but the program does not produce the correct output for this input. The program's logic for updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays and calculating the number of valid tuples does not align with the required condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

The program should iterate over all possible tuples \((x, y, z)\) and check the condition directly, but instead, it uses a more complex and incorrect approach to count the tuples. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
