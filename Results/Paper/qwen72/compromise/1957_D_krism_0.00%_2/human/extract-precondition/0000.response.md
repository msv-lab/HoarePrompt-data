Precondition: **The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
