Output State: **The `prefix` list remains unchanged, containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` variables remain unchanged. The `suf` list now contains the count of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (which is 0). Each sublist in `suf` will have the format `[count_of_0s, count_of_1s]` for the corresponding bit position.**
