To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`prefix` list**: This list contains the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`.
2. **`arr` list**: This is a list of integers.
3. **`n`**: This is the length of the `arr` list.
4. **`suf` list**: This list contains the count of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (which is 0). However, all counts are 0.
5. **`ans` variable**: This is the final result of the loop, which is the sum of the products of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position for each element in `arr`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`prefix` list**: The `prefix` list is constructed such that `prefix[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`. For example, if `arr = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`, then:
   - `prefix[0] = 0`
   - `prefix[1] = a1`
   - `prefix[2] = a1 ^ a2`
   - `prefix[3] = a1 ^ a2 ^ a3`
   - ...
   - `prefix[n] = a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ ... ^ an`

2. **`suf` list**: This list is supposed to contain the count of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (which is 0). However, the precondition states that all counts are 0. This means:
   - `suf[0] = [0, 0]` (count of 0s and 1s at bit position 0)
   - `suf[1] = [0, 0]` (count of 0s and 1s at bit position 1)
   - ...
   - `suf[31] = [0, 0]` (count of 0s and 1s at bit position 31)

3. **`ans` variable**: The `ans` variable is the sum of the products of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position for each element in `arr`. Given that all counts in `suf` are 0, the product of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position will also be 0. Therefore, the sum of these products will be 0.

### Conclusion:
Since the `suf` list contains all zeros, the `ans` variable will be 0. Therefore, the `print(ans)` statement will print 0.

Output: **0**
