### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It reads the list of integers `array` and converts each integer to a string.

2. **Digit Counting and Leading Zeros:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to count the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an array `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros in each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros`.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string `num`.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, incrementing a counter for each trailing zero until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` array in descending order.
   - It initializes `subtract_zero` to zero.
   - It iterates through the `zeros` array in steps of 2, adding the number of trailing zeros to `subtract_zero`.
   - This step is intended to simulate the optimal play where Sasha can concatenate integers to minimize the number of digits in the final number.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is true, it sets the result to "Sashah" (which should be "Sasha").
   - If the condition is false, it sets the result to "Anna".

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:**
  - The program outputs "Sashah" instead of "Sasha". This is a typographical error and should be corrected.

- **Logical Error:**
  - The program's logic for determining the winner is flawed. The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` does not accurately reflect the game's rules. The game's rules state that Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\), not if the number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.

### Correct Logic:
- **Anna's Turn:**
  - Anna can reverse any number, which does not change the total number of digits in the list.
- **Sasha's Turn:**
  - Sasha can concatenate two numbers, which reduces the number of elements in the list by one but increases the total number of digits.
- **Winning Condition:**
  - Sasha wins if the final number has at least `m` digits. This means the total number of digits in the list after all concatenations should be at least `m`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
    if total_digits >= m:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The original program has a logical error in determining the winner based on the number of digits. The corrected program accurately reflects the game's rules and should be used instead.
