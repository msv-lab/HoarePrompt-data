The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers `vals`. It calculates the product of all integers in `vals` and then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the result of dividing the product by the corresponding element in `vals`. It also calculates a value `den` as the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
