To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `r` and `vals`.

1. **`vals`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `vals` must contain at least one element.
2. **`r`**: This is the variable that will hold each element of `vals` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be explicitly initialized before the loop, as it will be assigned values from `vals` during the loop execution.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `N` is an input integer.
- `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes.
- `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
- `prod` is 1.

The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `vals`. Specifically, `vals` must have at least one element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `prod` is 1**
