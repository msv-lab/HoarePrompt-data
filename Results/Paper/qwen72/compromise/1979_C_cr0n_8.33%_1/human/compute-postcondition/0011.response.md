To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - `den` is `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
   - `den` is greater than 0.
   - The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged (but they are not used in the print statement).

2. **Understanding `prod`:**
   - If `vals` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of all these integers.
   - For example, if `vals = [2, 3, 4]`, then `prod = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`.

3. **Understanding `vprod`:**
   - Each element in `vprod` is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - Continuing the example, if `vals = [2, 3, 4]` and `prod = 24`:
     - `vprod[0] = prod / vals[0] = 24 / 2 = 12`
     - `vprod[1] = prod / vals[1] = 24 / 3 = 8`
     - `vprod[2] = prod / vals[2] = 24 / 4 = 6`
   - Therefore, `vprod = [12, 8, 6]`.

4. **Understanding `den`:**
   - `den` is calculated as `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
   - Continuing the example, if `prod = 24` and `vprod = [12, 8, 6]`:
     - `sum(vprod) = 12 + 8 + 6 = 26`
     - `den = prod - sum(vprod) = 24 - 26 = -2`
   - However, the precondition states that `den` is greater than 0, so this example is not valid. We need to ensure that the values in `vals` are such that `den` is positive.

5. **Valid Example:**
   - Let's consider a different example where `vals = [1, 2, 3]`:
     - `prod = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6`
     - `vprod[0] = prod / vals[0] = 6 / 1 = 6`
     - `vprod[1] = prod / vals[1] = 6 / 2 = 3`
     - `vprod[2] = prod / vals[2] = 6 / 3 = 2`
     - `vprod = [6, 3, 2]`
     - `sum(vprod) = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11`
     - `den = prod - sum(vprod) = 6 - 11 = -5`
   - This example also does not satisfy `den > 0`. We need to find a set of values in `vals` that does.

6. **Finding a Valid Set of Values:**
   - Let's try `vals = [2, 3, 6]`:
     - `prod = 2 * 3 * 6 = 36`
     - `vprod[0] = prod / vals[0] = 36 / 2 = 18`
     - `vprod[1] = prod / vals[1] = 36 / 3 = 12`
     - `vprod[2] = prod / vals[2] = 36 / 6 = 6`
     - `vprod = [18, 12, 6]`
     - `sum(vprod) = 18 + 12 + 6 = 36`
     - `den = prod - sum(vprod) = 36 - 36 = 0`
   - This example does not satisfy `den > 0` either. Let's try another set.

7. **Another Valid Set of Values:**
   - Let's try `vals = [1, 2, 4]`:
     - `prod = 1 * 2 * 4 = 8`
     - `vprod[0] = prod / vals[0] = 8 / 1 = 8`
     - `vprod[1] = prod / vals[1] = 8 / 2 = 4`
     - `vprod[2] = prod / vals[2] = 8 / 4 = 2`
     - `vprod = [8, 4, 2]`
     - `sum(vprod) = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14`
     - `den = prod - sum(vprod) = 8 - 14 = -6`
   - This example also does not satisfy `den > 0`.

8. **Final Valid Set of Values:**
   - Let's try `vals = [1, 2, 3, 4]`:
     - `prod = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`
     - `vprod[0] = prod / vals[0] = 24 / 1 = 24`
     - `vprod[1] = prod / vals[1] = 24 / 2 = 12`
     - `vprod[2] = prod / vals[2] = 24 / 3 = 8`
     - `vprod[3] = prod / vals[3] = 24 / 4 = 6`
     - `vprod = [24, 12, 8, 6]`
     - `sum(vprod) = 24 + 12 + 8 + 6 = 50`
     - `den = prod - sum(vprod) = 24 - 50 = -26`
   - This example also does not satisfy `den > 0`.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The precondition that `den` is greater than 0 is not satisfied by the examples we tried. However, the task is to determine what is printed by the `print` statement given the initial state.

10. **Output:**
    - The `print` statement will print the elements of the list `vprod` as strings, separated by spaces.
    - Based on the initial state, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
    - The exact values of `vprod` depend on the values in `vals`, but the format of the output will be the elements of `vprod` as strings, separated by spaces.

Output: **[vprod[0] vprod[1] vprod[2] ... vprod[len(vals)-1]] (where each vprod[i] is the result of prod divided by vals[i])**
