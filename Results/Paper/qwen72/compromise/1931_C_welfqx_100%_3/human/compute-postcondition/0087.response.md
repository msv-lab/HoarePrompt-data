Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `r` is `t`, `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements that are not equal was found, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum.reverse()` reverses the list `onum`, which is a copy of `num`. This means that the elements in `onum` are now in the opposite order compared to `num`. The values of the other variables (`ii`, `ck`, `n`, `r`, `f`, `j`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
