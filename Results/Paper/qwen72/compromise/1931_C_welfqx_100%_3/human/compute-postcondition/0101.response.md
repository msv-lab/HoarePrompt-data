Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is `t`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements that are not equal was found, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, `cn` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
