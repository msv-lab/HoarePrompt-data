The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` (so `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**
