The only objects in the loop head are variables `ii` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `ii` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 2, and `ii` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ii` is less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `n - 1` is greater than 1, so the loop can execute again if `ii` is 2 and `n - 1` is greater than 2.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n - 1` must be greater than 2**
