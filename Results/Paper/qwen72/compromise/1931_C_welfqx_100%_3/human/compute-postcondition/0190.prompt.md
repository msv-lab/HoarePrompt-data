Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal, and `n` is greater than 1. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is increased by `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`. If all elements in `onum` are equal, `ck` is `n - 1`. If `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `cn` is increased by `ck`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `n - 2`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `onum` up to the point where the elements differ, or `n - 1` if all elements from index 0 to `n - 2` are equal. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is updated to `cn + ck`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `ii`, `ck`, and `symb1` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
