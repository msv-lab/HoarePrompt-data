Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `j` is 2.**

The value of `f` is set to 0, overriding its previous value which was 1 if the first element of `num` was equal to the second element, otherwise 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
