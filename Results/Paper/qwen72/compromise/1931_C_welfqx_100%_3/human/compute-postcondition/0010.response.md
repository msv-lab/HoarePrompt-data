The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, and thus `j` being 1 must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1 if the first element of `num` is equal to the second element, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `j` is 1**
