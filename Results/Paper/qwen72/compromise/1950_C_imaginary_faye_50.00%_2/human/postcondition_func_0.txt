The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm). It converts each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the converted time followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input times have been converted and printed, but the original input variables are not modified.
