### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good approach to handle the elements in a structured manner.

3. **Tracking the MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the current MEX has been found.
   - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is a step to ensure the MEX is correctly calculated.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the value is 1, which represents the unique elements in the array.
   - If there are at least two unique elements, it sets `cur` to the second smallest unique element.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` at the end of the game.
  - The current logic breaks the loop as soon as it finds a gap, which is not always the correct MEX. For example, if the array is `[0, 1, 3, 3]`, the MEX should be 2, but the program might incorrectly break the loop at `3` and set `cur` to 1.
- **Handling Unique Elements:**
  - The logic for handling unique elements is also incorrect. The MEX should be determined by the smallest missing integer, not by the second smallest unique element.
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice should always try to pick the smallest missing integer to maximize the MEX, while Bob should try to prevent this by picking the smallest available integer.

### Correct Approach:
- **Simulate the Game:**
  - Alice and Bob should take turns picking elements from the array `a` and appending them to `c` for Alice.
  - The MEX should be calculated after all elements are picked.
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice should always pick the smallest missing integer that is not in `c` yet.
  - Bob should pick the smallest available integer that is not the smallest missing integer.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and has issues in calculating the MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
