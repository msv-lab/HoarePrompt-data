### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and then deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - We need to find the final score if both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - If both players play optimally, the MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times in `a` (since Alice can ensure it is included in `c`).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1` and the subsequent break statement do not correctly reflect the optimal play.
   - The final check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` and the subsequent increment of `cur` is not necessary and does not align with the optimal strategy.
   - The logic for setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt` is also incorrect and does not reflect the optimal play.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach would involve:
     - Counting the occurrences of each element in `N`.
     - Finding the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times in `N` (since Alice can ensure it is included in `c`).
     - If no such integer exists, the MEX is 0.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and the size of the array `S` and the array `N` for each test case.

- **Sorting and Dictionary Initialization:**
  - Sorting `N` is a good step to facilitate the MEX calculation.
  - The dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.

- **Main Loop:**
  - The main loop iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and the dictionary `M`.
  - The condition `if num > cur + 1` and the subsequent break statement are incorrect. This condition should not break the loop but should instead increment `cur` to the next smallest integer that is not in `c`.

- **Final Check and Output:**
  - The final check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` and the subsequent increment of `cur` is unnecessary and incorrect.
  - The logic for setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt` is also incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times in `N`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num in M:
                M[num] += 1
            else:
                M[num] = 1
        
        # Find the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times
        for i in range(S):
            if M.get(i, 0) % 2 == 1:
                print(i)
                break
        else:
            print(S)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Counting Occurrences:**
  - We count the occurrences of each element in `N` using a dictionary `M`.
- **Finding the MEX:**
  - We iterate through the range `[0, S-1]` to find the smallest integer `i` that appears an odd number of times in `N`.
  - If such an integer is found, we print it.
  - If no such integer is found, we print `S` (since all integers from `0` to `S-1` appear an even number of times, the MEX is `S`).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and contains logical errors that prevent it from producing the correct MEX for the array `c`.

Final: **False**
