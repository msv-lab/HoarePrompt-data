The only variable in the loop head is `lst[x]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst[x]`. If `lst[x]` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst[x]` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter but not empty, `s` is False.**
