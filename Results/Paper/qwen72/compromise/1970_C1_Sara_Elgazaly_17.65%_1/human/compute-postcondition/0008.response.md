Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 2, `y` is an integer provided by the user, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as the last element, `lst[b]` still contains `a` as the last element, `a` and `b` are updated to new integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list `lst[a]`. This means that `lst[a]` now has `b` as its last element. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list `lst[b]` still contains `a` as its last element, and `a` and `b` are updated to new integers provided by the user.
