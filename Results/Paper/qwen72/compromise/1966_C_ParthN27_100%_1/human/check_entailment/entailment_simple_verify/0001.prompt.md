You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    Alice

Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

    #State: The loop will iterate t times, and for each iteration, it will read n and a list of integers, process the list to determine if the game is won by Alice or Bob, and print the winner. After all iterations, the variables t, n, arr, s, ans, and i will be in their final states as determined by the last iteration of the loop, but the specific values will depend on the input provided for the last test case. The list s will be a sorted list of unique elements from the last arr list, with 0 prepended, and ans will be 1 if the last game is won by Alice, or 0 if won by Bob.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they can remove a positive integer \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to win.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game can be reduced to a Nim-like game where the piles are considered in terms of their distinct sizes.
   - If all piles have the same size, the player who starts (Alice) can always win by removing all stones in one move.
   - If the piles have different sizes, the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles \( n \) and the sizes of the piles \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
   - It then creates a set of the pile sizes to get the distinct sizes.
   - The set is converted to a list and sorted.
   - A 0 is prepended to the list to handle edge cases.
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1, which is used to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If there is only one distinct pile size (i.e., all piles have the same size), the program prints "Alice" because Alice can remove all stones in one move.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted list of distinct pile sizes and checks if the difference between consecutive sizes is greater than 1.
   - If a difference greater than 1 is found, the loop breaks.
   - The `ans` variable is toggled (XOR with 1) for each distinct pile size.
   - Finally, if `ans` is 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where all piles have the same size by printing "Alice".
   - For the case where piles have different sizes, the program uses the XOR operation to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - The logic of breaking the loop when the difference between consecutive sizes is greater than 1 is unnecessary and incorrect. The game's outcome depends solely on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes, not on the differences between them.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes is correct.
   - However, the loop that checks the difference between consecutive sizes is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes, which is the key insight for solving this problem. The redundant loop does not affect the final outcome, so the program is correct.
