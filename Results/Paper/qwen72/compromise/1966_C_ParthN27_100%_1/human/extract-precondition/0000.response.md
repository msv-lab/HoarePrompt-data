Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integers n and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the number of stones in each pile. t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
