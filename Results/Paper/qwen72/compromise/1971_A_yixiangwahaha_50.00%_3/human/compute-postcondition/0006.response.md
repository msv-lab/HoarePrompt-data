Output State: **`t` remains the same as the initial input integer, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers. The loop prints pairs of integers from `x` and `y` for each index `i` from 0 to 9. If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, it prints `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, it prints `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`. The values of `x` and `y` are not modified by the loop.**
