Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Fixed Number of Test Cases**: The program always reads 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t` provided. This is incorrect because the number of test cases should be determined by the input value `t`.

2. **Input Reading**: The program reads `t` but does not use it to control the number of test cases. Instead, it always reads 10 lines of input, which can lead to incorrect behavior if `t` is not 10.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the results with an extra space between the numbers, which is not necessary and may not be the expected format.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading the Number of Test Cases**: The program reads `t` and converts it to an integer.
- **Looping Through Test Cases**: It uses a loop that runs `t` times to read the input for each test case.
- **Reading and Comparing**: For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, compares them, and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted correctly without extra spaces.

This corrected program should work as expected for the given problem description.
