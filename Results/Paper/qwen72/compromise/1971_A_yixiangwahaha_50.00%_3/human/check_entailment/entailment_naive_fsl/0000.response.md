Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input for the number of test cases. According to the problem description, the first input line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), which specifies the number of test cases. The program, however, always reads 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will still attempt to read 10 inputs, leading to an error. If `t` is greater than 10, the program will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore the rest, which is also incorrect.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 9
  8 4
  1 4
  3 4
  2 0
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 9
  4 8
  1 4
  3 4
  0 2
  ```
- Actual Output:
  - The program will attempt to read 10 inputs but only 5 are provided, leading to an error or incorrect output.
