Reasoning:

The program is intended to read a series of test cases, each containing two integers, and then for each test case, output the minimum and maximum of the two integers. However, there are a few issues in the provided program that affect its correctness:

1. **Input Handling for `t`**:
   - The variable `t` is read from input but is never used in the program. The loop that processes the test cases should iterate `t` times, not a fixed 10 times. This is a critical error because the number of test cases can vary from 1 to 100, and the program should handle this dynamically.

2. **Fixed Loop Range**:
   - The loop that reads the test cases is hardcoded to run 10 times (`for i in range(10)`). This is incorrect because the number of test cases is given by `t`, and the loop should run `t` times.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output format in the program includes an extra space between the two integers and after the second integer. The problem description does not specify the need for an extra space after the second integer, so this is not strictly incorrect, but it's not optimal. However, since the problem description does not explicitly state that the output must not contain extra spaces, this is a minor issue.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle the number of test cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
