### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `final` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` which represents the number of pairs of integers (i.e., `n`).
   - It then reads the next line of input, which contains the `2n` integers, and splits this line into a list of strings `list1`.
   - It converts each string in `list1` to an integer and appends it to `list2`.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The program sorts `list2` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired first.

4. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program initializes a score `s` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list `list2` in steps of 2, adding the first number of each pair (which is the smaller number due to sorting) to the score `s`.

5. **Storing and Printing the Results**:
   - After calculating the score for each test case, it appends the score to the `final` list.
   - Finally, it prints each score in the `final` list.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the input and processes it as described in the problem.
- The sorting step ensures that the smallest numbers are always paired together, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
- The score calculation is done by summing the first number of each pair in the sorted list, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
