Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `n > 1`, it computes and prints the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n == 1`, it simply prints `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were input for each test case. **
