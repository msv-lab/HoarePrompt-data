You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `n > 1`, it computes and prints the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n == 1`, it simply prints `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were input for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem. It first checks if the number of yogurts `n` is greater than 1. If so, it calculates two possible costs: buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1`) and buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price (`ans2`). It then prints the minimum of these two costs. If `n` is 1, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt (`a`). This logic ensures that the program always finds the minimum cost for any valid input within the specified constraints.
