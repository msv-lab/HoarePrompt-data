### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem. Let's break down the program and the function summary to verify this claim.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for `n > 1`:**
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - It then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

3. **Logic for `n == 1`:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program simply prints the cost of one yogurt (`a`).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case `n > 1`:**
  - `ans1` is straightforward: it calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
  - `ans2` is more complex:
    - `b * (n // 2)`: This calculates the cost of buying the maximum number of pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
    - `a * (n % 2)`: This calculates the cost of buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.
  - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

- **Case `n == 1`:**
  - If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints the cost of one yogurt (`a`).

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
  - Output: `14` (Correct)

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
  - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem. It calculates the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price, and it prints the correct minimum cost for each test case. The logic is sound and the function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
