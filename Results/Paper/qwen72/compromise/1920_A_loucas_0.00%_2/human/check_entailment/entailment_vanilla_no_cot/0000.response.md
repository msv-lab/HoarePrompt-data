Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of integers that satisfy all the constraints. Instead, it only prints the first integer that satisfies the constraints, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the total number of integers that satisfy all constraints, not just the first one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        big = []
        less = []
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.add(a)
        
        min_k = max(big)
        max_k = min(less)
        
        if min_k > max_k:
            print(0)
        else:
            count = max_k - min_k + 1
            for i in no:
                if min_k <= i <= max_k:
                    count -= 1
            print(count)

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and the number of constraints for each test case.
2. **Constraints Storage**:
   - `big` stores the values for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).
   - `less` stores the values for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - `no` is a set that stores the values for constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).
3. **Determine Range**:
   - `min_k` is the maximum value from `big`, which is the smallest value k can be.
   - `max_k` is the minimum value from `less`, which is the largest value k can be.
4. **Check for Impossible Constraints**:
   - If `min_k` is greater than `max_k`, it means there are no integers that satisfy both constraints, so the program prints 0.
5. **Count Valid Integers**:
   - The initial count of valid integers is `max_k - min_k + 1`.
   - The program then subtracts the count of integers in the set `no` that fall within the range `[min_k, max_k]`.
6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final count of valid integers for each test case.

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly counts and outputs the number of integers that satisfy all the given constraints.
