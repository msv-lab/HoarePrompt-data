Output State: **The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged. The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. Depending on the conditions, it prints either A * B, A * C / 2 (if A is even), or X * C + B (if A is odd, where X = A // 2). The final state of the loop is that the loop has completed t iterations, and the values of t, n, a, and b are still within their initial ranges.**
