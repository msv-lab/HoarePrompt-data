### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`. This part is correct.

2. **Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`).
   - If `B * 2 < C`, it means that buying yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them in pairs at the promotion price. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A % 2 == 0`, it means the number of yogurts `A` is even.
   - In this case, the program calculates the total cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, which is `A * C / 2`.
   - This logic is also correct and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A % 2 != 0`, it means the number of yogurts `A` is odd.
   - The program calculates the total cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price (`X = A // 2`), and then buying the remaining one yogurt at the regular price (`B`).
   - The total cost is `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: `2 5 9`**
   - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
   - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`
   - `A % 2 == 0` is true, so the cost is `2 * 9 / 2 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case: `3 5 9`**
   - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
   - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`
   - `A % 2 != 0` is true, so the cost is `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case: `3 5 11`**
   - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
   - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`
   - The cost is `3 * 5 = 15`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case: `4 5 11`**
   - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
   - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`
   - The cost is `4 * 5 = 20`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Additional Considerations:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where the number of yogurts is even or odd.
- The program also correctly handles the case where the regular price for two yogurts is cheaper than the promotion price.
- The program's logic and calculations are consistent with the problem statement and the provided test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
