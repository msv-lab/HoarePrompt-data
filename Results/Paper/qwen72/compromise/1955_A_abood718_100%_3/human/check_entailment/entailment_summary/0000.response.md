Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values `A`, `B`, and `C` for each one. This matches the problem description.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if B * 2 < C`
     - This condition checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. If this is true, the function prints `A * B`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price. This is correct because if the promotion price is more expensive, it's better to avoid it.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif A % 2 == 0`
     - This condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If it is, the function prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price. This is correct because if the number of yogurts is even, you can always buy them in pairs to get the best deal.
   - **Condition 3**: `else`
     - This condition handles the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd. The function calculates `X = A // 2` (the number of pairs of yogurts) and then prints `X * C + B`, which is the cost of buying `X` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price. This is correct because if the number of yogurts is odd, you can buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buy the last yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `B * 2 < C` (e.g., `2 5 9` results in `10`).
   - It correctly handles even numbers of yogurts (e.g., `4 5 11` results in `22`).
   - It correctly handles odd numbers of yogurts (e.g., `3 5 11` results in `20`).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `2 5 9`, the function prints `9` because `9` is the promotion price for two yogurts, which is cheaper than `10` (2 * 5).
   - For the input `3 5 9`, the function prints `14` because it buys one pair at `9` and one yogurt at `5`, totaling `14`.
   - For the input `3 5 11`, the function prints `15` because it buys three yogurts at the regular price of `5` each, totaling `15`.
   - For the input `4 5 11`, the function prints `20` because it buys two pairs at `11` each, totaling `22`, but since `B * 2 < C` is not true, it buys four yogurts at the regular price of `5` each, totaling `20`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
