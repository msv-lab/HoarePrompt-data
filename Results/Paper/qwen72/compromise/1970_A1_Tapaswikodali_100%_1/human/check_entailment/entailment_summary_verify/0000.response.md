### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to perform a balanced shuffle on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on the balance (ascending) and position (descending for ties), and then forming a new string from the sorted characters.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is not used in the provided code. It appears to be a comparison function that could be used for sorting, but it is not called anywhere in `func_2`.
     - Since it is not used, we can ignore it for the purpose of this evaluation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function `func_2` takes a string `s` as input.
     - It initializes a list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects, which contain the balance, position, and character of each prefix.
     - It iterates through the string `s`, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
     - After the loop, it sorts `balance_info` based on the balance in ascending order and the position in descending order for ties.
     - Finally, it concatenates the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list to form the result and prints it.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The summary correctly states that `func_2` prints a rearranged version of the input string `s` based on the balance and position.
   - The sorting criteria are accurately described: by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties.

4. **Evaluating the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The explanation provided is accurate: the program maintains a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, computes the balance, sorts the list as required, and forms the result string.
   - The program does not return a value but prints the result, which is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Balance Calculation:**
     - The balance is correctly updated as the program iterates through the string. For each "(", the balance increases by 1, and for each ")", the balance decreases by 1.
   - **Sorting:**
     - The sorting criteria are correctly implemented using the lambda function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)`. This ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties.
   - **Result Formation:**
     - The result string is formed by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list, which is the correct approach to achieve the balanced shuffle.
   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the result string, which is the expected behavior according to the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
- The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
