#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the `balance` attribute of `infoA` and the `balance` attribute of `infoB`. Since `infoA.balance` is not equal to `infoB.balance`, the returned value is a non-zero integer.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, each of which is an object with attributes `balance` and `position`. If the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` are not equal, the function returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance`, which is a non-zero integer. If the `balance` attributes are equal, the function returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which is a positive integer. The function does not modify the input objects.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `balance` is 0, `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance value, the index `i`, and the character `s[i]` at that index, and the length of `balance_info` is `n`.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: - Since `result` is a string composed of the `character` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in the sorted `balance_info` list, the output will be the concatenation of these characters in the order they appear in the sorted list.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of the `BalanceInfo` objects in the sorted `balance_info` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")". It does not return a value but instead prints a string `result` which is a rearranged version of the input string `s` based on the balance of parentheses. The `result` string is formed by sorting the characters of `s` in a specific order (first by balance, then by position in reverse) and concatenating them. The function does not modify the input string `s`.
