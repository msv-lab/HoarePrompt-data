### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.
   - To maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to create `n` sub-problems.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - For each test case, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.
   - This is because if `d` is the GCD, then each sub-problem difficulty must be a multiple of `d`, and the sum of `n` such multiples must equal `x`.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum possible GCD.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and updates `ans` if `i` is greater than the current `ans`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i` and updates `ans` if `x // i` is greater than the current `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to create `n` sub-problems.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures that the loop runs efficiently, as it only checks up to the square root of `x`.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the divisor can be used to create the required number of sub-problems.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `n` is equal to `x` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is 1, which would result in the GCD being `x` itself.
