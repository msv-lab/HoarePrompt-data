You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers, `x` and `n`, from the user input. It then calculates and prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such divisor exists, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems is \( x \).
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Approach**:
   - The GCD of the sub-problems will be maximized if the sub-problems are as evenly distributed as possible.
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( n \), then the optimal solution is to have all sub-problems with difficulty \( \frac{x}{n} \), and the GCD will be \( \frac{x}{n} \).
   - If \( x \) is not divisible by \( n \), we need to find the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{n} \).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - `func_1` reads the values of \( x \) and \( n \).
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all integers \( i \) from 1 to the integer square root of \( x \) (inclusive).
   - For each \( i \), it checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% i == 0 \)).
   - If \( i \) is a divisor, it checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{i} \) and updates `ans` if \( i \) is greater than the current `ans`.
   - It also checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to \( i \) and updates `ans` if \( \frac{x}{i} \) is greater than the current `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

4. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The loop over \( i \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) is efficient because it reduces the number of iterations needed to find divisors.
   - The conditions `if n <= x // i` and `if n <= i` ensure that the number of sub-problems \( n \) can be formed with the current divisor \( i \) or \( \frac{x}{i} \).
   - The `max` function correctly updates `ans` to the maximum possible GCD.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 1 \), the GCD is \( x \) itself, which is correctly handled by the code.
   - For \( x = 1 \), the only possible sub-problem difficulty is 1, which is correctly handled by the code.
   - For \( n = x \), the only possible sub-problem difficulty is 1, which is correctly handled by the code.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The code is efficient for the given constraints, as it only iterates up to \( \sqrt{x} \), which is \( O(\sqrt{x}) \).

Given the above reasoning, the provided program appears to be logically correct and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
