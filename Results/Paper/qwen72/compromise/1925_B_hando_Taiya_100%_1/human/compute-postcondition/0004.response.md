To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications:

1. **Initial State**: `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - This means `ans` is a value that divides `x` without leaving a remainder.
   - `ans` is the largest such divisor that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given this information, when the `print(ans)` statement executes, it will print the value of `ans`, which is the maximum divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is greater than or equal to n)**
