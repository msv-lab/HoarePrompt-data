The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3. If the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**
