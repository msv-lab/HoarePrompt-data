Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The issue lies in the handling of the second type of operation (b=2) in `func_1`. The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` only appends one copy of the current array to itself, instead of appending `x` copies as required by the problem description. This results in an incorrect array state after operations of type 2, leading to incorrect answers for the queries.

To correct this, the line should be changed to `array.extend(array * (value - 1))` to append `x` copies of the current array to itself. This ensures that the array is extended correctly according to the problem's requirements.

Given the example provided in the original assessment:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 3
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

- After the first operation: `array = [1]`
- After the second operation: `array = [1, 2]`
- After the third operation (which should append 3 copies of `[1, 2]`): `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
- After the fourth operation: `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
- After the fifth operation (which should append 3 copies of `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`): `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`

The current implementation will produce an incorrect array state, leading to incorrect query results. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
