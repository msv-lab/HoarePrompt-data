### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `array` and an empty list `result`.
   - **Processing Operations**:
     - For each operation, if the operation type `op_type` is 1, it appends the integer `value` to the `array`.
     - If the operation type `op_type` is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current `array` to itself. This is done by extending the `array` with a list comprehension that iterates over the current `array` and appends each element `x` times.
   - **Handling Queries**:
     - For each query `k`, it appends the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the `result` list. This is because the array is cyclic, and the modulo operation ensures that the index wraps around if `k` exceeds the length of the array.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
     - It reads the operations and queries for each test case.
   - **Calling `func_1`**:
     - It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - **Printing Results**:
     - It prints the results of each test case.

### Issues:
- **Efficiency**:
  - The current implementation of `func_1` is inefficient for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is repeated `x` times, which can lead to a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case. This is not suitable for the constraints where `x` can be up to \(10^9\).
  - The array can grow very large, potentially exceeding memory limits.

### Correct Solution:
- To handle the constraints efficiently, we need to avoid explicitly constructing the array. Instead, we can keep track of the lengths of the segments added to the array and use this information to determine the element at any given index `k`.

### Revised Function 1:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    segments = []
    current_array = []
    total_length = 0

    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            current_array.append(value)
            total_length += 1
            segments.append((total_length, current_array[-1]))
        else:
            segment_length = total_length
            for _ in range(value):
                total_length += segment_length
                segments.append((total_length, current_array[-1]))

    result = []
    for k in queries:
        for (end, val) in segments:
            if k <= end:
                result.append(val)
                break
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Revised Function:
- **Segments**:
  - We maintain a list of segments, where each segment is a tuple `(end, val)`. `end` is the end index of the segment, and `val` is the value that repeats in this segment.
- **Current Array**:
  - We keep track of the current array and its total length.
- **Processing Operations**:
  - For the first type of operation, we append the value to the current array and update the total length.
  - For the second type of operation, we add `x` segments, each with the same value as the last element of the current array.
- **Handling Queries**:
  - For each query `k`, we find the segment that contains the index `k` and append the value of that segment to the result.

### Correctness:
- **True** if the revised function is used.
- **False** if the original function is used due to inefficiency and potential memory issues.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** for the original program.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The original program is incorrect due to its inefficiency and potential memory issues, especially for large values of `x` and `k`. The revised function addresses these issues by using a more efficient approach to handle the operations and queries.

Final: **False**
