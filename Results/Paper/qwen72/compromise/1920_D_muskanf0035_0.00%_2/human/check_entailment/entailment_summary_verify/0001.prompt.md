You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`, followed by the operations and queries themselves. It then calls another function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and prints the results returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the input variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` is undefined.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `array` and an empty list `result`.
   - **Processing Operations**:
     - For each operation, if the operation type `op_type` is 1, it appends the integer `value` to the `array`.
     - If the operation type `op_type` is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current `array` to itself. This is done by extending the `array` with a list comprehension that iterates over the current `array` and appends each element `x` times.
   - **Handling Queries**:
     - For each query `k`, it appends the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the `result` list. This is because the array is cyclic, and the modulo operation ensures that the index wraps around if `k` exceeds the length of the array.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
     - It reads the operations and queries for each test case.
   - **Calling `func_1`**:
     - It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - **Printing Results**:
     - It prints the results of each test case.

### Issues:
- **Efficiency**:
  - The current implementation of `func_1` is inefficient for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is repeated `x` times, which can lead to a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case. This is not suitable for the constraints where `x` can be up to \(10^9\).
  - The array can grow very large, potentially exceeding memory limits.

### Correct Solution:
- To handle the constraints efficiently, we need to avoid explicitly constructing the array. Instead, we can keep track of the lengths of the segments added to the array and use this information to determine the element at any given index `k`.

### Revised Function 1:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    segments = []
    current_array = []
    total_length = 0

    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            current_array.append(value)
            total_length += 1
            segments.append((total_length, current_array[-1]))
        else:
            segment_length = total_length
            for _ in range(value):
                total_length += segment_length
                segments.append((total_length, current_array[-1]))

    result = []
    for k in queries:
        for (end, val) in segments:
            if k <= end:
                result.append(val)
                break
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Revised Function:
- **Segments**:
  - We maintain a list of segments, where each segment is a tuple `(end, val)`. `end` is the end index of the segment, and `val` is the value that repeats in this segment.
- **Current Array**:
  - We keep track of the current array and its total length.
- **Processing Operations**:
  - For the first type of operation, we append the value to the current array and update the total length.
  - For the second type of operation, we add `x` segments, each with the same value as the last element of the current array.
- **Handling Queries**:
  - For each query `k`, we find the segment that contains the index `k` and append the value of that segment to the result.

### Correctness:
- **True** if the revised function is used.
- **False** if the original function is used due to inefficiency and potential memory issues.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** for the original program.
