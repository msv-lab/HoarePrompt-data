n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), operations is a list of n tuples where each tuple (b, x) has b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ n if b=1, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 if b=2, queries is a list of q positive integers (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c)), where c is the size of the array after all n operations, and q is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5).
