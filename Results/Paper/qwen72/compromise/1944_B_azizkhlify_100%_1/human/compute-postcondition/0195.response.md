Output State: **`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are equal, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
