Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is a non-empty list, and the loop has printed all elements of `res` separated by spaces. `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is updated to `ur + 2` and the value of `r[a[n] - 1]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul == ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is updated to `ur + 2`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, the values of `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `n + 2`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` was 2, then this element is now 0, and `ur` is `ur + 2`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
