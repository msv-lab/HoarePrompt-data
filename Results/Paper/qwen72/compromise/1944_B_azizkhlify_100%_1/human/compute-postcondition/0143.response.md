Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2, `ul` is increased by 2 and the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is set to 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.***
