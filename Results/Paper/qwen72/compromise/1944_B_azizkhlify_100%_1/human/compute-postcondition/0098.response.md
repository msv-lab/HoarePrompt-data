Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n + 2`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or remains unchanged.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.
   - If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.
   - The value of `i` is `n + 2`.
   - Therefore, the print statement will print the value of `a[n + 2]` twice, followed by a space.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - The output will be the value of `a[n + 2]` printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2] (where a[n + 2] is the value of the element at index n + 2 in the list a)**
