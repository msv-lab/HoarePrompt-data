The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or remains unchanged. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
