Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `res` is a non-empty list.
- `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: The code snippet references a list `a`, but the initial state does not provide any information about `a`. We can assume that `a` is a list that exists and is accessible in the context where the code is executed.
2. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is defined as `n + 2`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 2 (if `n` is 1) or greater.
3. **List Access `a[i]`**: The code attempts to access the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is at least 2, the list `a` must have at least `i + 1` elements to avoid an `IndexError`.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact values of `a` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables:

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is n + 2)**
