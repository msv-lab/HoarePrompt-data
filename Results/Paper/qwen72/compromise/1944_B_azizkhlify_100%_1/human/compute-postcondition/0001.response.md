The code snippet takes an input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, but this condition is not directly relevant to the current code snippet since it is taking a new input and splitting it into two integers.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are integers from the input, and both `n` and `k` must be greater than 0.**
