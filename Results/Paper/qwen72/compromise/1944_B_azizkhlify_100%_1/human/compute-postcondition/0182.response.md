The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `res` must still be non-empty, and `i` must be the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a non-empty list, and `i` is the first element of `res`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must now be the second element of `res`, and `res` must still be a non-empty list with at least one more element.

State: **`res` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `res`**
