Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is a placeholder, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of length `n` with elements at indices `a[j] - 1` set to 0 if they were 2 during the loop execution, otherwise they remain unchanged, `r` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is the total number of times an element in `l` was 1 and was printed, `ul` is the total number of times an element in `l` was 2 and was reset to 0, `ur` is 0, `res` contains all elements of `a` that were printed because `l[a[j] - 1]` was 1, and if `re` is equal to `k`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
