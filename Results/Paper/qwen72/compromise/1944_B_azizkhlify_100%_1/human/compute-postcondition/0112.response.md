Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, `res` must contain all its elements, and the loop has printed all elements in `res` with no elements left to print. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or remains unchanged, and `ur` is increased by 2 for each element in `a` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was initially 2. If `ul` becomes equal to `ur` at any point, the loop breaks and `i` is the index at which this condition was met. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `a` is a list of integers from the input. `l` is a list of `n` zeros. `r` is a list of `n` zeros. `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0.**
