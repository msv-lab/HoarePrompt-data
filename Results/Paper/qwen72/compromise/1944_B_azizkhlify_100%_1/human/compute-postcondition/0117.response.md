Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Since `i` is 1, the index being incremented is `a[1] - 1`. The initial state already mentioned that `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, so this remains unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 1, and `i` remains 1. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `l[a[1] - 1]` by 1.
