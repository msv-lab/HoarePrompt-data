To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which the statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` (but we don't have the initial value of `k` or `ul`).
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is a list of length `n` with elements at indices `a[j] - 1` set to 0 if they were 2 during the loop execution, otherwise they remain unchanged.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
- `re` is 1.
- `ul` is the total number of times an element in `l` was 2 and was reset to 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` contains the first element of `a`.
- If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Analysis:
- The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement is printing the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
- According to the initial state, `i` is 1.
- Therefore, the statement will print the second element of the list `a`.

### Output:
The code prints the second element of the list `a` followed by a space.
Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
