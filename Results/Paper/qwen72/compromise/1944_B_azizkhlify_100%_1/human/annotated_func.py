#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, it should take a list `a` of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function should return two lists `l` and `r`, each of length 2k, where `l` is a subset of the first half of `a` and `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`, and the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        l = [0] * n
        
        r = [0] * n
        
        re = ul = ur = 0
        
        res = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            l[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            r[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                l[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ul += 2
            if ul == k * 2:
                break
        
        k = 2 * k - ul
        
        if k:
            for i in range(n):
                if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                    print(a[i], end=' ')
                    re += 1
                    res.append(a[i])
                if re == k:
                    break
        
        print()
        
        for i in res:
            print(i, end=' ')
        
        if ul != ur:
            for i in range(n, 2 * n):
                if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                    print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                    r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                    ur += 2
                if ul == ur:
                    break
        
        print()
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `res` is a list containing the elements that were printed in the second part of the output for each iteration, `n` and `k` are the values provided in the input, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers representing the count of each element in the first half of `a` after processing, `r` is a list of `n` integers representing the count of each element in the second half of `a` after processing, `ul` is the total number of elements from the first half of `a` that were processed and printed, and `ur` is the total number of elements from the second half of `a` that were processed and printed. The loop has printed all required elements and the final output is complete.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of length 2n. For each test case, it processes the list `a` to find and print pairs of elements from the first half and the second half of `a` such that the total number of printed elements from the first half is `2k` and the total number of printed elements from the second half is also `2k`. The function ensures that the bitwise XOR of the printed elements from the first half is equal to the bitwise XOR of the printed elements from the second half. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final output is printed.
