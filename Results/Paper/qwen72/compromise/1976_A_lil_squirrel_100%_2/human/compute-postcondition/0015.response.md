Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if any of the following conditions are met: the letters in `password` are not in sorted order, the digits in `password` are not in sorted order, or there is a transition from a letter to a digit in the `password`. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` or `password`. **
