The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `password`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns 'NO' in two cases and 'YES' in one case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n`, and based on certain criteria, it returns 'NO' or 'YES'.
