Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length of the password `n` and the password itself. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Character Separation**: The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` and `digits`. This is done correctly by checking if each character is a digit or a letter.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - These checks are necessary to ensure that the letters and digits in the password are sorted as required.

4. **Transition Check**:
   - The program checks for any transition from a letter to a digit within the password. If such a transition is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - This check is necessary to ensure that no digit comes after a letter, as specified in the problem description.

5. **Output**:
   - If all the checks pass, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.
   - The function does not modify the input parameters `n` or `password`, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles passwords that consist only of letters or only of digits correctly, as these should always be considered strong if they are sorted.
   - The program also handles the case where the password is a single character, which should always be considered strong.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to verify the strength of the password according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
