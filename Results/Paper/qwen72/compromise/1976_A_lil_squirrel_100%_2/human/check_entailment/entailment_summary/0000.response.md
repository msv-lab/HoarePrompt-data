Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets each requirement:

1. **Password Composition**: The program assumes that the input password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, which aligns with the problem's constraints. This is not explicitly checked in the program, but it is assumed based on the problem's input format.

2. **Letters Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: The program checks if the list of letters extracted from the password is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Digits Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: Similarly, the program checks if the list of digits extracted from the password is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if there is any transition from a letter to a digit. If such a transition is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Output**: If none of the above conditions are violated, the program returns 'YES'.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. It correctly identifies and returns 'NO' for passwords that do not meet the conditions and 'YES' for those that do.

Given the provided test cases and the function's behavior, the program seems to be correct and meets all the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
