Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Separation of Letters and Digits**: The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Order Check**:
   - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Return**: If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
