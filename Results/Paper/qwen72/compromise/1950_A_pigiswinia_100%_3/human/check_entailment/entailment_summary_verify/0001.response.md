Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This aligns with the problem description.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program enters a loop that runs `t` times, which is correct as per the problem description.
3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits.
4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `a < b < c` is used to determine if the digits form a stair. This is correct based on the problem description.
   - The condition `a < b > c` is used to determine if the digits form a peak. This is also correct based on the problem description.
   - If neither condition is met, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct behavior as per the problem description.
5. **Output**: The program prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, including the input handling, loop structure, condition checking, and output. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are correctly updated for each test case, and the loop counter `i` is incremented appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles the input and output as specified.

Final: **True**
