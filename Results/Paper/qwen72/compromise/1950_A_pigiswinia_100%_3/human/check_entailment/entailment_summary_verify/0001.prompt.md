You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (with `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case, and the loop counter `i` will be `t-1`. All other variables that were part of the initial state but not modified within the function will remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, which is also correct.
3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, which is correct as the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits.
4. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct based on the problem description.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct based on the problem description.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE", which is the correct behavior as per the problem description.
5. **Output**: The program prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles the input and output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
