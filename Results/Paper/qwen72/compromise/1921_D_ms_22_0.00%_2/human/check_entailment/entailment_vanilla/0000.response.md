### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Array `b`:**
   - The array `b` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements of `b` to maximize the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A max heap (implemented using a min heap with negative values) is initialized to store tuples of the form `(-difference, original_value, index)`.
   - For each element `i` in array `a`, the program calculates the difference between `i` and the smallest element in `b` (`b[0]`) and the largest element in `b` (`b[m-1]`).
   - The tuple with the larger difference is pushed into the heap. This ensures that the elements with the largest potential differences are considered first.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap until it is empty.
   - For each tuple popped from the heap, it checks if the index of the element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`) is still within the valid range (`[tp1, tp2]`).
   - If the index is out of range, it recalculates the differences using the current valid range and updates the answer accordingly.
   - If the index is within the valid range, it adds the difference to the answer and updates the range pointers (`tp1` or `tp2`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - Sorting `b` and using a heap to prioritize the largest differences ensures that the program maximizes the total difference `D`.
  - The use of heap ensures that the elements with the largest potential differences are considered first, which is essential for maximizing `D`.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the index of the element in `b` is out of the current valid range by recalculating the differences using the current range.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case) by correctly outputting `0`.
  - It also handles the case where `n` is equal to `m` (e.g., the third test case) by correctly calculating the maximum difference.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting step takes \(O(m \log m)\) time.
  - The heap operations (push and pop) take \(O(\log n)\) time, and there are `n` such operations.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(t \cdot (m \log m + n \log n))\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` for each test case. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input.

Correctness: **True**
