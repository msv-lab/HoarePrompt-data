Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `diff2`, which is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. The other variables remain unchanged, except `tp2` which is decremented by 1.
