Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `tp1` is equal to `tp2 + 1` or `tp2` is equal to `tp1 - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet used in the previous iterations.**
