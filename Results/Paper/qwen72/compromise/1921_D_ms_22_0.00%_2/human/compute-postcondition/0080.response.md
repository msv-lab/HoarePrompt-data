Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of the heap before the operation, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff1`, and `diff2` are still valid. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then if `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive), `ans` is updated to `ans + (-item[0])`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `tp1` remains unchanged and `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
