Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` are updated such that `ans` is increased by `diff`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the positive value of `diff` (since `item[0]` is `-diff`). The other variables and the state of `max_heap` remain unchanged.
