Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.**

The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
