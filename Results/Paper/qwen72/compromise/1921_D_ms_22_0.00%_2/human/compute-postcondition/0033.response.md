To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to verify the condition in the loop head. The loop head is `while max_heap:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.

Since `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, and `n` is at least 1, `max_heap` is guaranteed to be non-empty right before the loop. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one time without any adjustments.

State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers input by the user, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple is either `(-diff1, a[j], 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, a[j], m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `j` is the index of the element in `a` and `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between `a[j]` and `b[0]` and `b[m - 1]` respectively, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0**.
