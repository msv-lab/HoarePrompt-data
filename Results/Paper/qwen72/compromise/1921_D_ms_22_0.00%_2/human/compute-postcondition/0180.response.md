Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing a single tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `i` is the first element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**
