Output State: **The loop has finished executing, `max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet used in the previous iterations for all test cases, and `tp1` is equal to `tp2 + 1` or `tp2` is equal to `tp1 - 1` for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The loop has finished executing, and `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The `max_heap` is an empty list, as it is used and cleared for each test case.
- The variables `n` and `m` retain their values as input integers for each test case.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and contains the integers input by the user for each test case.
- The list `b` remains sorted and contains the integers input by the user for each test case.
- The variable `ans` holds the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet used in the previous iterations, for all test cases.
- The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are updated such that `tp1` is equal to `tp2 + 1` or `tp2` is equal to `tp1 - 1`, indicating that all elements in `b` have been matched to elements in `a` for each test case.
