Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the negated value of `item[0]`, `tp1` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `tp1` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`max_heap`, `n`, `item`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
