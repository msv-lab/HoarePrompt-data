Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with two tuples removed and must still contain at least one tuple. `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + -item[0]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `tp1` remains unchanged and `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
