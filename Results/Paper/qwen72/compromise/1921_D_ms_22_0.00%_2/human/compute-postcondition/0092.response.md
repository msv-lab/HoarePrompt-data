Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0.** 

The value of `ans` is now 0, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
