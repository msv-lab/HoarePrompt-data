### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Equality of `n` and `k`:**
   - If `n` (the number of coins Alice has) is equal to `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy), the program correctly prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, as each jewel will cost 1 coin, and she will have exactly `k` coins to spend.

2. **Check if `n` is Less Than `k`:**
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Setting Up Stalls:**
   - The program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The first stall is priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel. This ensures that Alice can buy at most `k - 1` jewels from this stall because:
     - If Alice buys `k - 1` jewels, she will spend `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
     - The remaining coins will be `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)`.
   - The second stall is priced at 1 coin per jewel. Alice will use the remaining coins to buy the last jewel from this stall.

4. **Verification of the Solution:**
   - The program calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) by summing the number of jewels she can buy from each stall.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" because it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints "YES" and the prices of the two stalls.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Solution:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is equal to `k`.
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `k`.
  - For the case where `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
    - From the first stall, she can buy at most `k - 1` jewels.
    - From the second stall, she can buy the remaining 1 jewel.
  - The program ensures that the total number of stalls is at most 60, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

### Correctness:
**True**
