The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and `n` is less than `k`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` in any way. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
