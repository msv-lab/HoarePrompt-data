The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and the current values of `n` and `k` are equal. However, the `print` statement does not use `n` or `k` in its output. It simply prints the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
