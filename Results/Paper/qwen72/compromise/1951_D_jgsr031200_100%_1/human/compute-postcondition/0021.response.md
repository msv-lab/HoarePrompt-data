The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function does not return any value in both cases (Case_1 and Case_2).

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) and does not return any value.**
