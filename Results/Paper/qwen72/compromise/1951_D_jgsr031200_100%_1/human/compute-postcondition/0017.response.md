Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains the same (but its value is not specified).
   - `costs` remains the same (but its value is not specified).
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - `n - k + 1` becomes `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
     - `n // (1 - k)` becomes `0 // (1 - k)`.
     - The integer division of 0 by any non-zero number is 0.
   - `n // 1`:
     - `n // 1` becomes `0 // 1`, which is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of `0` and `0`, which is `0`.

3. **Condition:**
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Since `h` is 0, this condition implies that `k` must be less than or equal to 0 for the condition to hold true.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet contains only a `print` statement: `print('YES')`.

Given the initial state and the condition, the `print` statement will always execute and print 'YES' because the condition `h >= k` is satisfied when `h` is 0 and `k` is less than or equal to 0.

Output: **YES**
