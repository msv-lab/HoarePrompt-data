### Reasoning

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters, which is a deviation from the problem description. However, since the function reads input directly, this does not affect the correctness of the program for the given test cases. The function correctly reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Set of Characters:**
   - The set `us` is correctly initialized to contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This set is used to filter characters in the string `s`.

3. **Sliding Window Logic:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find sequences of `k` unique characters in the string `s`. When the window `win` contains all `k` unique characters, it adds the current character to the list `ans` and increments the count `ps`. This logic is intended to track the number of valid sequences found.
   - However, the logic for generating a non-occurring subsequence when the answer is "NO" is flawed. The program attempts to construct a non-occurring subsequence by appending a character from the set `us` that is not in the current window `win` and padding with 'a' characters. This approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid non-occurring subsequence of length `n`.

4. **Output for "YES" and "NO":**
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints "YES" and returns. This part of the logic is correct because it indicates that the string `s` contains at least `n` valid sequences of `k` unique characters.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, the program prints "NO" and attempts to generate a non-occurring subsequence. The generation logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid non-occurring subsequence. For example, in the third test case:
     - The program prints "NO" correctly.
     - It then constructs a string by appending a character from `us` that is not in `win` and padding with 'a' characters. This results in "abc" being printed, which is incorrect because "ccc" is a valid non-occurring subsequence.

5. **Flawed Subsequence Generation:**
   - The program's approach to generating a non-occurring subsequence is not robust. It should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings is not a subsequence, it should be printed as the answer.

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem, particularly in generating a valid non-occurring subsequence when the answer is "NO". The logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence is also flawed.

**Final: False**
