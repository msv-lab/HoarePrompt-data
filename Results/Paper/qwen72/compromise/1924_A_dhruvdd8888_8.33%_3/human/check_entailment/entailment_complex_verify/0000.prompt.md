You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us` remain unchanged; `win` is an empty set; `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`; `ps` is the number of times `win` reached the size `k`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: *`n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us` remain unchanged; `win` is an empty set; `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`; `ps` is the number of times `win` reached the size `k`. `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us` remain unchanged; `win` is an empty set; `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`; `ps` is still less than `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, followed by a string `s`. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters and counts how many such sequences it can form (`ps`). If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string by appending a character from the set of the first `k` lowercase letters that is not in the current sequence, followed by `n - ps - 1` 'a' characters, and prints this string. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `us` remain unchanged, `win` is an empty set, and `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for generating a non-occurring subsequence when the answer is "NO" is flawed. The program attempts to construct a non-occurring subsequence by appending characters that are not in the current window (`win`) and padding with 'a' characters, but this approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid non-occurring subsequence of length `n`.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

The program's output for the third test case is:
```
NO
abc
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
NO
ccc
```

The program fails to generate a valid non-occurring subsequence of length `n` for the given string `s`. The logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence is also not correct, as it only checks if the window contains all `k` characters, which is insufficient to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
