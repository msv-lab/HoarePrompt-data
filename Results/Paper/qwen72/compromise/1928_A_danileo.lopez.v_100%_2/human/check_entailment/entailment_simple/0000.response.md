### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The function checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If either dimension is even, it proceeds to check if the other dimension is different from the half of the even dimension:
     - If `a` is even, it calculates `a1` and `a2` as `a // 2` and checks if `a1 != b`.
     - If `b` is even, it calculates `b1` and `b2` as `b // 2` and checks if `b1 != a`.
   - If either of these conditions is satisfied, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither of these conditions is satisfied, it prints 'No'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the function directly prints 'No' because it is impossible to cut an odd-sized rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.
   - If one dimension is even and the other is the same as half of the even dimension, the function prints 'No' because the resulting rectangles would be the same as the original rectangle.

4. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on the conditions described.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
