Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one by making a single cut parallel to one of the sides. The key insight here is that for Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions (a or b) must be even. This is because an even dimension can be halved, and the resulting halves can be used to form a new rectangle with a different aspect ratio.

The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is even, it checks if `a // 2` is not equal to `b`. If `b` is even, it checks if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Let's break down the logic:
1. If `a` is even and `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, then Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a // 2` by `b` rectangles and form a new rectangle of size `a` by `2 * (a // 2)`, which is different from the original `a` by `b` rectangle.
2. Similarly, if `b` is even and `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, then Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a` by `b // 2` rectangles and form a new rectangle of size `2 * (b // 2)` by `b`, which is different from the original `a` by `b` rectangle.
3. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, or if the halves are equal to the other dimension, then Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

The program correctly implements this logic and handles all the test cases provided in the example. It also handles the constraints (1 <= t <= 10^4 and 1 <= a, b <= 10^9) appropriately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
