Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where one dimension is 1 and the other dimension is even. According to the problem description, a rectangle of size \(1 \times \text{even}\) cannot form a different rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for such cases. For example, for the input \(1 \times 4\), the program should output "No" but it outputs "Yes".
