The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function should also handle an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
