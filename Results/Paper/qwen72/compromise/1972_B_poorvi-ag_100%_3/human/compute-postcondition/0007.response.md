The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. Additionally, the function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.

The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the provided information. However, based on the context, it is reasonable to infer that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one, likely indicating the final state of the coins or some derived property from the initial state and the number of coins.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function returns a result for each test case.**
