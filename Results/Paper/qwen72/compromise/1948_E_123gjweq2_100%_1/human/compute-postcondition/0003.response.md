Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.**

Explanation:
- `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers with `left` <= `right`.
- `clique` remains a positive integer.
- `small_element` remains `left + 1`.
- `big_element` remains `right + 1`.
- `mid` remains `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`. This new variable `not_mid` is the result of the given expression.
