Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`. Given `big_element` is `right + 1` and `small_element` is `left + 1`, the expression simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which further simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. Since `left` and `right` are non-negative integers and `left` <= `right`, the value of `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
