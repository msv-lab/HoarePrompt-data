You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` to determine the number of cliques and assign values to the vertices.
   - It also uses a helper function `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the minimum number of cliques needed. The idea is to divide the vertices into groups of size at most k, which is a reasonable approach.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` iterates over each clique.
   - `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)`: This function call is intended to populate the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for the current clique. The parameters are:
     - `left`: The starting index of the current clique.
     - `right`: The ending index of the current clique.
     - `clique`: The clique number.

4. **Function `make_array` Analysis:**
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These variables are used to determine the range of values to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the range of values.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements that are not in the midpoint range.
   - The first loop `for i in range(mid)` assigns the smaller values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving backwards.
   - The second loop `for i in range(not_mid)` assigns the larger values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving forwards.

5. **Checking the Edge Condition:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) should be satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - The way `make_array` assigns values ensures that within each clique, the difference \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \) is minimized, which helps in forming cliques.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution appears to correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and assign values to the vertices such that the edge condition is satisfied. The logic and implementation seem to align with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
