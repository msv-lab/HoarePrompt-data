Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `ans` is the string `s[0] * 2`, `x` is 0, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `0` of the string `s` (since `x` is 0) repeated twice to the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` was an empty string, so after this operation, `ans` becomes the string `s[0] * 2`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
