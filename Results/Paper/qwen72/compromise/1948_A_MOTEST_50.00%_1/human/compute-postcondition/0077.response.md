Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice, `x` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` was initially the string `s[0]` repeated twice.
- The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends `s[1]` (since `x` is 1) repeated twice to the existing value of `ans`.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
