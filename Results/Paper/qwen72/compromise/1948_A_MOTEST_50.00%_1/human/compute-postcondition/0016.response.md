Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even input integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice, `x` is 2, `j` is 1**

The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
