Output State: **The function `func` is defined as `def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y = 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y = 0. The program is currently executing within the main module. `t` is now an input integer.**
