Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `i` is `x`, `s` is the result of the expression `1 + sum((s // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x))` where `s` starts at 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.** 

The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated based on the input provided. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. The input values for `k`, `x`, and `a` must be integers, and `k` must be greater than 1.
