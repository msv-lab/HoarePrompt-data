The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if the range specified by `int(input())` has not been exhausted. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, the range specified by `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

However, the state of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `s` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. The only adjustment needed is for the loop counter `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `i` is `x`, `s` is the result of the expression `1 + sum((s // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x))` where `s` starts at 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
