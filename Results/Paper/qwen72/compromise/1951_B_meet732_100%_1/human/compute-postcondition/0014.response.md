Postcondition: ***`a` remains unchanged; `x` remains equal to `a[k]`; `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, but currently `ind` has only one element; `c` is 2; `ind` is not an empty list; `ind[0]` is not equal to 0; `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`***
