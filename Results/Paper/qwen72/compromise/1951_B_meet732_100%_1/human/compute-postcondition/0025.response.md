Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` unique integers, where `2 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. It returns an integer based on the following conditions: 

1. If no elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`.
2. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
3. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is greater than `k`, it returns `ind[0] - 1`.
4. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
5. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and the first element's index is 0, it returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
6. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
7. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

The list `a` remains unchanged, and the function's purpose is to find a specific index or distance based on the relative positions of the elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`. **
