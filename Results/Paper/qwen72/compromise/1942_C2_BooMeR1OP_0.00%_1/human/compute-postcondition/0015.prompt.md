Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, `a` remains a sorted list where each element is equal to the original element minus 1, `present` remains a set containing all unique elements of `a`, `ans` is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of elements in `a` for which `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `present` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `present`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the positive differences between consecutive elements in `a` (considering `a` as a circular list with the last element wrapping around to the first element plus `n`).
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
