You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of vertices `a` that Bessie has chosen and adjusts them to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each vertex.

2. **Initial Triangular Pieces Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a non-intersecting manner.

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program iterates through the chosen vertices `a` and checks if adding a vertex at `(a[i] + 1) % n` or `(a[i] + 2) % n` can form additional triangles.
   - If `t1` (i.e., `(a[i] + 1) % n`) is not already present in the set of chosen vertices and `t2` (i.e., `(a[i] + 2) % n`) is present, it increments `ans` by 1. This is because adding `t1` can form a new triangle with `a[i]` and `t2`.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices in the sorted list `a`.
   - It uses a list `gaps` to store these gaps. The gaps are calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, where `next_elem` is the next vertex in the sorted list, wrapping around the polygon if necessary.

5. **Maximizing Triangles by Adding Vertices:**
   - The program sorts the gaps in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the gaps and tries to add vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added (`pairs = gap // 2`).
   - If `y` (the number of vertices you can add) is greater than or equal to `pairs`, it adds `gap` to `ans` and decreases `y` by `pairs`.
   - If `y` is less than `pairs`, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks out of the loop, as no more vertices can be added.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Initial Triangular Pieces Calculation:**
  - The initial calculation of `ans` as `x - 2` is correct because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a non-intersecting manner.

- **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
  - The logic to check if adding a vertex at `(a[i] + 1) % n` or `(a[i] + 2) % n` can form additional triangles is correct. This ensures that the new vertex forms a valid triangle with the existing vertices.

- **Calculating Gaps:**
  - The calculation of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices is correct. The gaps are calculated correctly and stored in a list.

- **Maximizing Triangles by Adding Vertices:**
  - The logic to maximize the number of triangles by adding vertices is correct. The program sorts the gaps and iterates through them, adding vertices as needed and updating `ans` and `y` accordingly.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the logic for maximizing the number of triangular pieces is sound.

Correctness: **True**
