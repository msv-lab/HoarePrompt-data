### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the arrays for each test case. This part is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program sorts the array `arr`. This is necessary to find the median, which is the element at index `n // 2` for an array of length `n`.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median is correctly identified as `arr[median_index]`, where `median_index = n // 2`.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a min-heap with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Operation Counting:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. Each increment is counted as an operation. This ensures that the median of the array is increased by the minimum number of operations.

6. **Result Collection:**
   - The number of operations required for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm correctly identifies the median and uses a heap to efficiently manage the elements that need to be incremented. The while loop ensures that the smallest element in the heap is incremented until it is greater than the current median, which is the correct approach to minimize the number of operations.

### Potential Issues:
- **Heap Initialization:**
  - The heap is initialized with elements starting from the median index, which is correct for arrays of odd length. However, for arrays of even length, the median is the element at index `n // 2`, but the heap should include elements from `n // 2` to the end, which is also correct in this implementation.
- **Heap Operations:**
  - The use of `heapq.heappop` and `heapq.heappush` ensures that the smallest element is always processed first, which is optimal for minimizing the number of operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The input handling, sorting, heap operations, and result collection are all implemented correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
