Output State: **`heap[0]` is now the next smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is equal to the previous `heap[0]`, `heap` has the same number of elements as before the execution of the code, `operations` is increased by 2, and `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `arr[median_index] + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` adds the value `smallest + 1` to the heap.
- `heap[0]` is now the next smallest element in the heap, which is the root of the heap after the push operation.
- The value of `smallest` remains the same as the previous `heap[0]`.
- The heap now has the same number of elements as it did before the execution of the code, because an element was added to the heap.
- The value of `operations` is increased by 2, as the initial state already mentioned that `operations` is increased by 2.
- The condition `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `arr[median_index] + 2` remains unchanged and still holds true.
