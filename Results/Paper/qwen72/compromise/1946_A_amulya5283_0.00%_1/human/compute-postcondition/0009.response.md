To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition: `heap[0] <= current_median`.

### Current State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `i` is 0
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is the first element of `test_cases[0]`
- `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[0]` and is now sorted in ascending order
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`
- `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end
- `operations` is 0

### Loop Condition:
- `heap[0] <= current_median`

### Analysis:
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap.
- `current_median` is the median element of the sorted array `arr`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true. This means the smallest element in the heap must be less than or equal to the median of the array.

### Adjustments:
- The only variables in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`.
- `current_median` is derived from `arr[median_index]`, and `heap` is derived from the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end.
- Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, and it should be less than or equal to `current_median` for the loop to execute.

Given that `heap` is constructed from the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) is `arr[median_index]`, which is exactly `current_median`.

Therefore, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is already satisfied because `heap[0]` is equal to `current_median`.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[0]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[0]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, `operations` is 0**
