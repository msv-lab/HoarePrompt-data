Output State: **`heap[0]` is now the smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is equal to `arr[median_index] + 1`, and `heap` has one fewer element than before. `operations` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- `smallest` is assigned the value of the smallest element in `heap`, which is `arr[median_index] + 1`.
- `heap[0]` is now the next smallest element in the heap, and the heap has one fewer element than before.
- `operations` is increased by 1, as the operation of popping an element from the heap is counted.
