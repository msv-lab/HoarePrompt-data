Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is a binary string representing `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3]**. 

The code snippet initializes the list `ans` with the values [2, 3]. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
