Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is a binary string representing `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is a binary string representing `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk`.** 

The code snippet calculates the length of the binary string `bk` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. All other variables remain unchanged.
