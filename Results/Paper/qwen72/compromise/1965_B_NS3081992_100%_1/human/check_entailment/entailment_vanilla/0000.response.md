### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_7()` to read the integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `k == 1`, the program handles it separately:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]` because the only valid subsequence is `[2]` and it does not sum to `k = 1`.
     - For other values of `n`, it initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k = 1`.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For `k > 1`, the program constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k - 1`.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the sequence does not equal `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k`.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program returns the length of the sequence and the sequence itself in the required format.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Base Case:**
  - For `k = 1` and `n = 2`, the sequence `[2]` is correct because it does not have a subsequence that sums to 1.
  - For other values of `n`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, ...]` (powers of 2) ensures that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k = 1`.

- **Correctness of General Case:**
  - The sequence constructed for `k > 1` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully choosing the elements.
  - The sequence also ensures that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k` by including `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` and the necessary powers of 2.

- **Size Constraint:**
  - The sequence size is at most 25, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed as subsequences.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
