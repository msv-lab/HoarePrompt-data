### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of scenarios `n` and the `n` lines of input, each representing the transition videos between scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary videos associated with each scenario, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input lines, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Funny and Scary Videos**:
   - The program iterates through each input line and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each scenario based on the characters 'F' and 'S'.
   - This ensures that the program knows how many funny and scary videos are already decided for each scenario.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only Funny or Only Scary Videos**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny videos (i.e., `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`) and only scary videos (i.e., `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] > 0`), respectively.
   - This helps in determining which scenarios have a fixed type and which are still undecided.

4. **Assigning Videos to Undecided Scenarios**:
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny videos (`len(sa)`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary videos (`len(sb)`), the program appends the indices of scenarios that are still undecided (i.e., `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`) to `sa`.
   - It then updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'F' for the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) scenarios in `sa` and with 'S' for the rest.
   - If the number of scenarios with only scary videos is greater, it appends the indices of scenarios that are still undecided to `sb` and updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'S' for the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) scenarios in `sb` and with 'F' for the rest.

5. **Outputting the Final Transition Plan**:
   - The program constructs the final transition plan by iterating through each scenario and each other scenario.
   - If the transition video is already decided (i.e., not '?'), it keeps the original value.
   - If the transition video is undecided, it assigns 'F' or 'S' based on the logic described above.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed transition plan.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Handling of Input and Output**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and constructs the output in the required format.
  - It ensures that the diagonal elements are always '.' and that the matrix is symmetric.

- **Assignment of Undecided Videos**:
  - The program's logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided scenarios is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) scenarios in `sa` or `sb` for assigning 'F' or 'S', respectively.
  - This approach does not guarantee that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is satisfied for all permutations of scenarios.
  - For example, if `n = 12`, the program might assign 'F' to the first 2 scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest. This could lead to a sequence of 9 'S' videos in a row, which violates the constraint of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 12}{4} \rceil = 9\) consecutive videos of the same type.

- **Constraint Satisfaction**:
  - The program's approach to assigning videos to the undecided scenarios is too simplistic and might lead to violations of the constraint in some cases.
  - The logic for ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is not robust enough. It does not consider the overall distribution of 'F' and 'S' across all permutations of scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
