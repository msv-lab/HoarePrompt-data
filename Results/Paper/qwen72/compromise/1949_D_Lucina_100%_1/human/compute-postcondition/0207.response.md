The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sb`. Since `sb` initially contains the value 1, after appending `i`, `sb` will contain the values [1, 2]. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is now [1, 2].**
