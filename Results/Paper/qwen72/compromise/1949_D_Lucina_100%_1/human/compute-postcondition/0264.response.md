To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `sb` is a list of indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop.

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices from 1 to `n`.
   - For each index `j - 1`:
     - If `xx[2][j - 1]` is not '?', the character at index `j - 1` of `xx[2]` is appended to `nx`.
     - If `xx[2][j - 1]` is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`.
     - Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.

3. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `j` starts at `n + 1` and decreases to 1 in the loop.
   - `i` is fixed at 2.
   - `sb` contains indices where both `a` and `b` are 0, and the length of `sb` is `n`.
   - `n // 4 - 1` gives the number of elements in the first quarter of `sb` minus one.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - The string `nx` will be constructed based on the conditions provided.
   - For each character in `xx[2]`:
     - If the character is not '?', it is directly appended to `nx`.
     - If the character is '?', we need to check if `i` or `j` (which is `n + 1 - k` for the k-th iteration) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.
     - If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended.
     - Otherwise, 'F' is appended.

Given the initial state and the loop conditions, the output will depend on the specific values of `xx[2]` and `sb`. However, we can describe the output in a general form:

- If `xx[2][j - 1]` is not '?', the character at `xx[2][j - 1]` will be appended to `nx`.
- If `xx[2][j - 1]` is '?', and `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, 'S' will be appended.
- Otherwise, 'F' will be appended.

Since the exact values of `xx[2]` and `sb` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these conditions.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n, and each character is determined by the conditions: if xx[2][j - 1] is not '?', the character at index j - 1 of xx[2] is appended; if xx[2][j - 1] is '?', and either i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, 'S' is appended; otherwise, 'F' is appended)**
