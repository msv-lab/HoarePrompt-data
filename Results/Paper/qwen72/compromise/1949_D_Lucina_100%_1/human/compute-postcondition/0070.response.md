Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is a string input by the user, `xx` now contains the list `x` as its last element, and the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'F'. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `b[1]` remains unchanged.***
