The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. The initial state specifies that `nx` is determined based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` and the positions of `i` and `j` relative to the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`. However, the code snippet directly appends 'F' to `nx` without considering the initial conditions for `nx`.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` with 'F' appended to it.**
