Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `j` is `n`. The values at indices 1 to `n` of the list `a` are incremented by 1 for each 'F' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the list `x`. Similarly, the values at indices 1 to `n` of the list `b` are incremented by 1 for each 'S' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the list `x`. The initial values of `a` and `b` at indices 1 to `n` are modified based on the characters in `x`, while the states of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.**
