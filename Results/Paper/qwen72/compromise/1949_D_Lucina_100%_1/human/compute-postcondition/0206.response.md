The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is a list that now contains the value 1. Otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged.**
