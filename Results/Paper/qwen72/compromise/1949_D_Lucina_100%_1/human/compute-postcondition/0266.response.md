Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nx = ''` initializes `nx` as an empty string.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `sb`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The conditions and logic for determining the characters in `nx` are not affected by this initialization, so they remain as described in the initial state.
