The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. Given that `i` is 3 in the initial state, the value at index 3 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1, `x[0]` is either 'F', 'S', or any other value, `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged.**
