Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` and `a[1]` are both increased by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` and `b[1]` are both increased by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then the values of `a[j]`, `a[1]`, `b[j]`, and `b[1]` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `a` and `b` at each index from 1 to `n` will be updated based on the characters in the string `x`. Specifically, for each character in `x`:
- If the character is 'F', both `a[1]` and `a[j]` (where `j` is the current index in the loop) are incremented by 1.
- If the character is 'S', both `b[1]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1.
- If the character is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a[1]`, `a[j]`, `b[1]`, or `b[j]`.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
