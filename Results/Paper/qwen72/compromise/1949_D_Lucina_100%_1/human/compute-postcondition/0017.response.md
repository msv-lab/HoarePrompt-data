Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 2, `a[1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is increased by 1.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions for `n` and `x` are still valid.
