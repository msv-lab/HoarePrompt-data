Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 2, `a[1]` is increased by 1, `a[2]` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `a[2]` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state indicates that `a[1]` was already increased by 1, and now `a[2]` has also been increased by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, and `j` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
