Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 1, and if the character at the position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the character at the position `j - 1` in `x` is not 'S' and `b[1]` remains unchanged.***
