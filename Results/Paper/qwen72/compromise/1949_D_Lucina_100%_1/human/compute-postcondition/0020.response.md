Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 2, `b[1]` is increased by 1, `b[2]` is increased by 1.**

The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[2]` by 1, as `j` is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
