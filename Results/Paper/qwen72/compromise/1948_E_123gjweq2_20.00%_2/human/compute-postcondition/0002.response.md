Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is equal to `left + 1`, `big_element` is equal to `right + 1`, `mid` is equal to `(right + 1) - (left + 1) // 2`.**

In natural language: The values of `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged. `small_element` is still equal to `left + 1`, and `big_element` is still equal to `right + 1`. The new variable `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the difference between `big_element` and `small_element` by 2, which simplifies to `(right + 1) - (left + 1) // 2`.
