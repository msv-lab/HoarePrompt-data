Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is equal to `left + 1`, `big_element` is equal to `right + 1`, `mid` is equal to `(right + 1) - (left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is equal to `right - left + 1 - mid`.**

Explanation:
- `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`.
- The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged.
- `mid` is still equal to `(right + 1) - (left + 1) // 2`.
- The new variable `not_mid` is equal to `right - left + 1 - mid`.
