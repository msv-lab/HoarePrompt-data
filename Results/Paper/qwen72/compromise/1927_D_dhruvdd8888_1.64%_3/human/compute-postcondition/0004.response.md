Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `N` is the number of test cases and it is an integer read from stdin, `s` is 0, `e` is 0. The total sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5. `input` is now `sys.stdin.readline`.**

The variable `e` has been initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
