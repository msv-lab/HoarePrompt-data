You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

The number of queries `q` for each test case is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The total sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a dummy value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It iterates through the array to create a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of a segment of the array where all elements are the same.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index is just greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It then retrieves the segment information from `arr` using `min(eli, LA)`.
   - The program checks if the start index `s` of the segment is greater than `l`:
     - If `s` is greater than `l`, it prints the indices `s-1` and `s` if `s` is not 1.
     - If `s` is 1, it prints `-1 -1` because there is no valid pair.
   - If the end index `e` of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` because the segment does not contain any different elements.
   - If the end index `e` is less than `N`, it prints the indices `s` and `e+1`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program includes a debug print statement for a specific test case (`ppp == 23`), which is not a standard practice but does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The program also includes a conditional check `if tc > 5:` which skips processing for large test cases, which is incorrect as it does not handle all queries.

### Issues:
- **Conditional Skip for Large Test Cases:**
  - The line `if tc > 5:` followed by `continue` skips processing for queries in test cases where `tc > 5`. This is incorrect because it means that for large test cases, the program does not process any queries, leading to incomplete or incorrect output.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** due to the conditional skip for large test cases. This means that for some test cases, the program will not process the queries and will not produce the required output.

### Correctness: **False**
