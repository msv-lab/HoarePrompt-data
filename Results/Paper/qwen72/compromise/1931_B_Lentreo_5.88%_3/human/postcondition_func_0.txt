The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` from user input. It then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums` is zero. If this sum is zero, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `last` is the last element of the last `nums` list, and `curr` is the sum of the differences calculated for the last `nums` list.
