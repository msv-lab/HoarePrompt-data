Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least three elements, `last` is the second element of the `nums` list, `i` is the third element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.***
