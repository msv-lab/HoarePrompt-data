The loop head involves the variables `i` and `nums`. For the loop to execute, `nums` must be a non-empty list. The variable `i` will take the value of the elements in `nums` during each iteration. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `last`, `curr`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `nums` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will be the first element of `nums` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is 0, `i` is the first element of `nums`**
