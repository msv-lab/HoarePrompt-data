The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `nums`, and `last` is the last element of `nums`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least 3 elements. The next value of `i` will be the third element in `nums`. The state of `t`, `_`, and `curr` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the third element in `nums`.**
