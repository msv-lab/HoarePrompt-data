Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the current value of `curr` remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be an integer input by the user. The values of `t`, `_`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` remain unchanged. The condition for `curr` (whether it is 0 or not) is still valid.
