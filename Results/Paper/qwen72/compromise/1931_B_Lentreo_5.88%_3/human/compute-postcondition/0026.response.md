Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `curr` is 0.**

The code snippet sets `curr` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in the `nums` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
