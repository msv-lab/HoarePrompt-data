Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder and not used.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.
- The current value of `curr` is 0.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any variable values.

Output: **YES**
