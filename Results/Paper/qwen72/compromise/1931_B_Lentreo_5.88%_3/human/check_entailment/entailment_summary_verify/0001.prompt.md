You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` from user input. It then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums` is zero. If this sum is zero, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `last` is the last element of the last `nums` list, and `curr` is the sum of the differences calculated for the last `nums` list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers, each with an initial amount of water `a_i`.
   - We can pour any amount of water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the described operation.
   - The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, which means the target amount of water in each container is `sum(a_i) / n`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is an integer.
   - To achieve the target amount in each container, we need to ensure that the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the target amount.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from any container to any other container to the right of it. This means we can only move water from left to right.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program attempts to solve the problem by comparing each element in the list `nums` with the last element `last`.
   - It calculates a cumulative difference `curr` between each non-zero element and `last`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly determine if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - The target amount of water in each container should be `sum(nums) // n`, not `last`.
   - The program does not check if the water can be redistributed to the target amount using the allowed operations.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water `target = sum(nums) // n`.
   - Check if it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have `target` units of water.
   - A key observation is that if the water can be redistributed, the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount should be zero at the end of the process.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the third test case `a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`:
     - The target amount is `sum([4, 5, 2, 1, 3]) // 5 = 15 // 5 = 3`.
     - We can redistribute the water as follows:
       - Pour 1 unit from the first container to the fourth: `[3, 5, 2, 2, 3]`.
       - Pour 1 unit from the second container to the third: `[3, 4, 3, 2, 3]`.
       - Pour 1 unit from the second container to the fourth: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
     - The program should output 'YES' for this case, but it does not because it uses the wrong logic.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the water can be redistributed to the target amount.

Correctness: **False**
