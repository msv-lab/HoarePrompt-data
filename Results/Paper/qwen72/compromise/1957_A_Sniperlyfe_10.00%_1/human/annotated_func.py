#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer in each inner list is the number of sticks n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from the test cases in `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears as the first element in the inner lists of `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique `n` value by 4. The final state of the program includes a dictionary `freq` that maps each unique `n` value to its frequency in the input `arr`.
