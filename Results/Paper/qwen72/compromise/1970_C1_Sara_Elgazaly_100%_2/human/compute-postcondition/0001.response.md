Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, the tree is represented by a list of n-1 edges where each edge is a tuple (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node is an integer `u_1` such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user. `lst` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list.**
