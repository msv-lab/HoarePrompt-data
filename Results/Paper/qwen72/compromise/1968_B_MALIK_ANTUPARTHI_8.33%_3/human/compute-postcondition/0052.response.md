Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 1, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is assigned the value of `e.index(d[j]) + 1`.
- `d[j]` is the character at index 1 of the string `d` (since `j` is 1).
- `e.index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `d[j]` in the string `e`.
- The value of `k` is then `e.index(d[j]) + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
