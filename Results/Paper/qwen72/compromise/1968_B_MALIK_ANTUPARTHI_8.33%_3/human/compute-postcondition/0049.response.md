Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `b` is an integer input value and must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer input value, `i` is 1, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 0, `k` is 0, and the character at index `j` in `d` is not found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
