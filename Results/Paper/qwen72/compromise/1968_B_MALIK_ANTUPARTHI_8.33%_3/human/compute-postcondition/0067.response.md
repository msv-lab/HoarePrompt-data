Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is `b` or the index where the loop was broken, `k` is the index of the last character in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `e`**: These variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- **`b`**: This is the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run, and it remains the same.
- **`c`**: This variable also remains unchanged.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will either be equal to `b` (if the loop ran to completion) or the index where the loop was broken (if the loop was exited early due to a break statement).
- **`k`**: This variable will be updated based on the loop's execution:
  - If the loop ran to completion, `k` will be the index of the last character in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1.
  - If the loop was broken early, `k` will be the index where the loop was broken, which is the index of the character in `d` that was not found in the remaining substring of `e` or the index where `k` reached `c`.

In summary, the loop will update `j` and `k` based on the conditions inside the loop, but all other variables will remain in their initial state.
