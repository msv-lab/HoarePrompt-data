The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input, followed by `n` lines of operations and `q` integers as queries. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` to process these inputs and prints the resulting list of integers. The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to produce and print the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the only lasting effect is the output produced by the `print` statements.
