You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and operations is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x, with b in {1, 2} and 1 <= x <= 10^9 for b=2, and queries is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the `result` list has been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are reset to their initial states at the beginning of each iteration, so their final values are not meaningful after the loop completes. The only lasting effect is the output produced by the `print` statement for each iteration, which consists of the results of the `func_1` function for the given `n`, `operations`, and `queries` in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes a series of operations on an array and then returns a list of results based on the queries provided.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
