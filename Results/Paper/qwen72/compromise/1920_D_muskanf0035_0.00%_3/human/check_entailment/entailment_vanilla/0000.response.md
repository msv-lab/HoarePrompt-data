### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an array `a` that starts empty.
   - We perform `n` operations, which can be of two types:
     - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer `q` queries, each asking for the `k`-th element of the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of operations), and `queries` (list of queries).
     - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the answers.
     - It iterates through each operation:
       - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value `x` to the array.
       - If the operation type is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself.
     - After all operations, it processes the queries:
       - For each query `k`, it appends the element at position `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list.
     - Finally, it returns the result list.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries.
     - It reads the operations and queries.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.

3. **Identifying Potential Issues:**
   - **Memory and Performance:**
     - The array `array` can grow very large, especially with type 2 operations where `x` can be up to \(10^9\).
     - This can lead to memory issues and performance degradation.
   - **Handling Large Queries:**
     - The queries can be up to \(10^{18}\), but the array size is limited by the operations.
     - The current implementation uses modulo operation to handle queries, which is correct in theory but may not be efficient or memory-friendly for very large arrays.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for appending elements and handling queries is correct.
   - However, the implementation is not efficient for large inputs, particularly when `x` in type 2 operations is very large.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct but inefficient for large inputs. Given the constraints, the program may fail due to memory limits or time limits. Therefore, the program is not considered correct for the problem as stated.

### Correctness:
**False**
