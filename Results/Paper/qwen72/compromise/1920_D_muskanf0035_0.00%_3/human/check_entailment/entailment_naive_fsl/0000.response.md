Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the second type of operation correctly. Specifically, when the operation type is 2 and the value is x, the program should append x copies of the current array to the end of the array. However, the current implementation only appends one copy of the array, regardless of the value of x. This means the program will not produce the correct array for operations of type 2 with x > 1.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 10
  1 1
  1 2
  2 3
  1 3
  2 2
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 2 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1 2 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3
  ```

In the third operation, the program should append 3 copies of the current array [1, 2] to the end, resulting in [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. However, it only appends one copy, resulting in [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for the queries.
