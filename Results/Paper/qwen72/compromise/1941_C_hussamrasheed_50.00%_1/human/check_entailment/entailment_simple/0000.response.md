### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Substring Removal**:
   - The program counts the number of occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` using `s.count('map')`.
   - It then replaces all occurrences of "map" in `s` with an empty string using `s.replace('map', '')`.
   - After that, it counts the number of occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` using `s.count('pie')`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" for each test case, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Substring Handling**:
  - The program only counts and removes the substring "map" before counting "pie". This can lead to incorrect results if the substring "pie" appears in the original string but is not counted because it was not present after removing "map".
  - For example, in the string "mappie", the program will count one "map" and remove it, resulting in "pie". It will then count one "pie" and print 2. However, the correct answer should be 3 because "mappie" can be made beautiful by removing the characters at positions 1, 2, and 3.

### Correct Solution:
- To correctly solve the problem, the program should count and remove both "map" and "pie" substrings in a way that ensures all occurrences are considered. One approach is to use a loop to repeatedly find and remove the substrings until none are left.

### Conclusion:
- The given program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the substrings "map" and "pie" in a way that ensures the minimum number of deletions is calculated correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
