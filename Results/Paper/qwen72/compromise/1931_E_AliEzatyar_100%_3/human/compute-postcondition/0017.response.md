The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list is in the range from 1 to 10^9, and the length of the list is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns the number of trailing '0's in the list `num` up to the first non-'0' element, or 0 if there are no trailing '0's.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the number of trailing '0's in the list up to the first non-'0' element, or 0 if there are no trailing '0's.**
