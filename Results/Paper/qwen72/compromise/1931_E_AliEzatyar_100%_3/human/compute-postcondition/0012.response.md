Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `counter` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `counter` is incremented by 1.
- The initial state of `num`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remains unchanged.
- The condition for `num[i]` and the previous state of `counter` are not affected, so they remain as described in the initial state.
