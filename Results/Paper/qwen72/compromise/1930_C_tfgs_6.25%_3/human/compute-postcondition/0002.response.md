The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`t` and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0**
