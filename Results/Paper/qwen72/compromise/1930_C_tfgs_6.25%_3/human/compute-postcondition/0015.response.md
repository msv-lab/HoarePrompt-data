Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `a` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is greater than 0.**
