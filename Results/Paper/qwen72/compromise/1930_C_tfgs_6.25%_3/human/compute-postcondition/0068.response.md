Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then modifies each element in `a` by adding its index plus one to it. After this, it processes `a` to create a new list `ans` that contains all unique elements from `a` in descending order, along with additional integers that fill the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` in a space-separated format. The function does not return any value. **
