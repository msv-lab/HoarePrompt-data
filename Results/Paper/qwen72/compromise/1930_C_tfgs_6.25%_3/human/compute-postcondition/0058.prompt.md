Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), `a` is now sorted in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `a` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of `a[0]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `a` must have at least two elements, `i` is 1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of `a[0]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`. If `i` > 0, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` minus `adv`, and `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) and the values from `a[0] - 1` to `a[0] - adv`, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[0] - a[1] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[0]]`, and `adv` must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv - 1`, and `counter[a[0]]` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[1]]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `a` must have at least two elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of `a[0]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`. If `i` > 0, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`. `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) and the values from `a[0] - 1` to `a[0] - adv`, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[0] - a[1] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[0]]`, and `adv` must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv - 1`, `counter[a[0]]` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, `ans` now contains the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), the values from `a[0] - 1` to `a[0] - adv`, and `a[2]`, `counter[a[2]]` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
