The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is increased by 1.**
