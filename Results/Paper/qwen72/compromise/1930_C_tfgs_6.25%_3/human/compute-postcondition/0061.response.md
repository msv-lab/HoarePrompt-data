The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of each element in `a` is decreased by 1, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` in their original order, and additional elements that fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` such that the total number of elements in `ans` is `n + 1`. The last element of `ans` is `ans[-1] - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`**
