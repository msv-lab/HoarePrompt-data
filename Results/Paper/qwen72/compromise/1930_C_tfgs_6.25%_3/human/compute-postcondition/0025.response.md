Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `a` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[-1] - 1`, `a[-1] - 2`, ..., `a[-1] - adv`, `adv` is `cnt` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `j` is `adv - 1`, `cnt` is now `cnt - adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is now `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`.**

Explanation:
- The code `counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv` updates the count of the element `a[i - 1]` in the `counter` object by subtracting `adv` from its current count.
- Since `i` is 0, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[-1]`, which is the last element of the list `a`.
- The value of `adv` is equal to `cnt`, so `counter[a[-1]]` is reduced by `cnt`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
