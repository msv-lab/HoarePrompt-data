Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the insertion of elements into the set `S` as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem states that the operation `a_i + i` should be inserted into the set `S` for each index `i` selected, and the element `a_i` should be deleted from the array `a`. However, the program modifies the elements of `a` directly by adding `i + 1` to each element, which is incorrect.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
6 4 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
11 7 6
```

**Actual Output:**
```
11 7 6
```

While the actual output matches the expected output in this case, the program's logic is flawed. The program should be inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S` for each selected index `i`, and then constructing the array `b` from the sorted set `S` in descending order. However, the program modifies the array `a` directly, which is not what the problem description specifies.

To illustrate the issue more clearly, consider a different input:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5 4 3 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5 4 3 2
```

In this case, the program still produces the correct output, but it is by coincidence. The program should be inserting `1+1=2`, `2+2=4`, `2+3=5`, and `3+4=7` into the set `S`, and then constructing the array `b` from the sorted set `S` in descending order. The correct output should be `[7, 5, 4, 2]`, but the program's logic does not follow the correct insertion and deletion steps.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
