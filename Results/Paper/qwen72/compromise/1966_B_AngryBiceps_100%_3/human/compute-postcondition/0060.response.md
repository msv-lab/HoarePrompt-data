Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input string to the list `a`. Initially, `a` was an empty list, so after this operation, `a` contains one input string. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` remain unchanged.
