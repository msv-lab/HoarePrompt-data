Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing the initial input string and a new input string, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input string, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- `first_row` is updated by concatenating the first character of the initial input string with the first character of the new input string, which is the first character of the last element in the list `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `last_row`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
