Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a grid of characters 'W' and 'B' representing white and black squares, respectively. The grid is defined by its dimensions n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a` concatenated together, and `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` and the last string in `a` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` consists of more than one unique character, or the last string in `a` consists of more than one unique character, or the first string in `a` is equal to the last string in `a`, or `first_row` and `last_row` are the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of a single repeated character and the last string in `a` also consists of a single repeated character, and these two strings are not the same, then this condition is true. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` has more than one distinct character, or the last string in `a` has more than one distinct character, or the first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`, or the first row has more than one distinct character, or the last row has more than one distinct character, or the first row is the same as the last row.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` contains only one distinct character, the last string in `a` contains only one distinct character, and the first string is not equal to the last string, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part, where either the first string in the list `a` contains more than one distinct character, or the last string in the list `a` contains more than one distinct character, or the first string in the list `a` is the same as the last string in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
