Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the input string in `a` at index 1, followed by the first character of the input string in `a` at index 2, `last_row` is the last character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the input string in `a` at index 1, followed by the last character of the input string in `a` at index 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`.
- `last_row` was initially the last character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the input string in `a` at index 1.
- After the code execution, `last_row` now includes the last character of the input string in `a` at index 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
