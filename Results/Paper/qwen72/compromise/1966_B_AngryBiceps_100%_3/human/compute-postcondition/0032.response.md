To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for i in range(n):
```
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is controlled by the loop and will be set to 0 at the start of the first iteration. The other variables (`t`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the first input integer
- `m` is the second input integer
- `a` is an empty list
- `first_row` is an empty string
- `last_row` is an empty string
- `i` is `n-1`

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The initial state of `i` being `n-1` is not relevant to the loop head, as `i` will be reset to 0 by the loop itself.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
