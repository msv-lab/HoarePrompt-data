Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails when the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color, but the first and last rows or columns are not uniform. For example, consider the following grid:

```
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```

In this case, the grid can be made entirely white by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners (both 'B'), but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it checks only the first and last rows and columns for uniformity, which are not uniform in this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
