Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The given program checks two specific conditions:
1. If the first row and the last row of the grid each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different.
2. If the first column and the last column of the grid each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different.

If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Let's analyze why these conditions are used:

1. **First Row and Last Row Check**:
   - If the first row and the last row each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different, it means that there is no way to perform an operation that would change the color of the entire grid to a single color. This is because any operation that involves the first row and the last row would require them to be the same color initially, which is not the case here.

2. **First Column and Last Column Check**:
   - Similarly, if the first column and the last column each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different, it means that there is no way to perform an operation that would change the color of the entire grid to a single color. This is because any operation that involves the first column and the last column would require them to be the same color initially, which is not the case here.

However, the program does not check all possible scenarios where the grid can be made uniform. For example, it does not check if there are any other rows or columns that could be used to perform operations that would eventually make the entire grid uniform. 

To ensure correctness, we need to consider the following:
- If there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid, it is always possible to make the entire grid uniform by selecting appropriate subrectangles. This is because we can always select two squares of the same color and extend the operation to cover the entire grid.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of making the entire grid uniform even if the first and last rows or columns are not uniform.

Correctness: **False**
