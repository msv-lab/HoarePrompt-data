Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to the final value of `curr_v` before the loop exits, `curr_v` is now `n + (len(permutation) // k - 1)`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `len(permutation)`. The values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and the initial setup of `permutation` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`**: This is the last element in the `permutation` list that gets updated by the loop. After the loop completes, it will hold the final value of `curr_v` before the loop exits.
- **`curr_v`**: Initially, `curr_v` starts at `n`. Each iteration of the loop increments `curr_v` by 1. The total number of iterations is `len(permutation) // k`, so `curr_v` will be incremented by `len(permutation) // k` times. Therefore, the final value of `curr_v` will be `n + (len(permutation) // k - 1)`.
- **`multiples_of_k_plus_i`**: This variable is incremented by `k` in each iteration. The loop runs until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `len(permutation)`.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and the initial setup of `permutation` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
