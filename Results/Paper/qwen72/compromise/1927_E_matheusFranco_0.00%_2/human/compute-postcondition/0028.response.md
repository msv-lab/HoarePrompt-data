The code snippet `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v` updates the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list to the value of `curr_v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`).
- `permutation[1]` is now `curr_v`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus two.
- `i` is 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **`multiples_of_k_plus_i`**: This variable is calculated as `1 + k`. Since `k` is even and within the given range, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is a specific index in the `permutation` list.

2. **`curr_v`**: This variable is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus two. Mathematically, this can be expressed as `curr_v = (n // k) + 2`.

3. **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`**: The value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list is updated to `curr_v`.

After executing the code, the output state is:
- `n` and `k` remain the same.
- `permutation` is updated such that `permutation[1 + k]` is now `curr_v`.
- `permutation[1]` remains `curr_v`.
- `idx` remains 0.
- `idx_v` remains 1.
- `curr_v` remains `(n // k) + 2`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains `1 + k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is `curr_v`, `permutation[1 + k]` is `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `(n // k) + 2`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.**
