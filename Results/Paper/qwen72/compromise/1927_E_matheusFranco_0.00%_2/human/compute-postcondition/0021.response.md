The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. Given that `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus one, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.**
