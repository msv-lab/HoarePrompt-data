To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to it:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
   - The `permutation` list of length `n` is filled such that for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` up to the last valid index are set to consecutive integers starting from `1`.
   - `curr_v` is now equal to `n + (n // k)`, which is the total number of elements filled in the `permutation` list.
   - `idx` and `idx_v` remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of the `permutation` list separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the Filling of the `permutation` List**:
   - For each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` are set to consecutive integers starting from `1`.
   - This means that the list is filled in a pattern where every `k`th element is filled with consecutive integers.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `n = 8` and `k = 2`.
   - The `permutation` list will be filled as follows:
     - For `i = 0`: Elements at indices `0, 2, 4, 6` will be set to `1, 2, 3, 4`.
     - For `i = 1`: Elements at indices `1, 3, 5, 7` will be set to `5, 6, 7, 8`.
   - The resulting `permutation` list will be `[1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]`.

4. **Constructing the `result` String**:
   - The `result` string is constructed by joining the elements of the `permutation` list with spaces.
   - For the example above, `result` would be `"1 5 2 6 3 7 4 8"`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The `permutation` list will always be filled in the described pattern, ensuring that the elements are consecutive and placed at the specified intervals.
   - The `result` string will contain these elements separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be a string containing the elements of the `permutation` list separated by spaces, following the filling pattern described.

Output: **"1 5 2 6 3 7 4 8" (or the corresponding elements for the given `n` and `k`)**.
