The code snippet assigns the value of `curr_v` (which is 3) to the position `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the list `permutation`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3 * k` and `3 * k` is less than the length of `permutation`, the element at index `3 * k` in `permutation` will be updated to 3.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` with `permutation[0]` set to 1, `permutation[k]` set to 2, and `permutation[3 * k]` set to 3, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 3, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3 * k` and `3 * k` must be less than `len(permutation)`**.
