Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` must be less than `len(permutation)`.**

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
