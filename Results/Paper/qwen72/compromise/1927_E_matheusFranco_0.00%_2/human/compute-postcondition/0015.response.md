The variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. If `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of `permutation`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than the length of `permutation`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently `2 * k`, and `k` is even and within the range 2 to `n`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` should be updated to a value that is still less than `len(permutation)`.

However, without knowing the exact value of `n` and `k`, we cannot determine the exact next value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. But we can ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` (or some multiple of `k`) to maintain the condition for the next iteration.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k` and `k` is even, the next logical step would be to increment `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` to `3 * k`, ensuring it remains less than `len(permutation)`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` with `permutation[0]` set to 1 and `permutation[k]` set to 2, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 3, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3 * k` and `3 * k` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
