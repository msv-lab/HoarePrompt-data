You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The `permutation` list of length `n` is filled such that for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` up to the last valid index are set to consecutive integers starting from `1`. The variable `curr_v` is now equal to `n + (n // k)`, which is the total number of elements filled in the `permutation` list. The variables `idx` and `idx_v` remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: "1 5 2 6 3 7 4 8" (or the corresponding elements for the given `n` and `k`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` such that for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` up to the last valid index are set to consecutive integers starting from 1. The function then prints this permutation as a space-separated string. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is now `0` (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), and `func_1()` has been called `t` times, where `t` is the initial value of `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` is reduced to `0`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The function effectively repeats the execution of `func_1` based on the user-provided integer.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the input format as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem states that the first line of input contains the number of test cases `t`, and this value is used to iterate over multiple test cases. However, the function `func_1` reads the input directly without considering the number of test cases, which means it will only process the first test case and ignore the rest.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
5
2 2
3 2
10 4
13 4
7 4
```
The program will only read and process the first test case (`2 2`) and will not proceed to the next test cases. This violates the requirement to handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

Additionally, the function `func_1` does not validate the input constraints (e.g., ensuring `k` is even and within the specified range). While this might not cause the program to fail in all cases, it is still a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not well-formed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to its failure to handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description.
