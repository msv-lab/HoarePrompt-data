Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
  - `a[0]` is 500.
  - For `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500.
- `x` is a list of integers.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a` Construction:**
   - The first element of `a` is explicitly given as 500.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), `a[i]` is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `x` added to 500.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - `a[1]` will be `500 + x[0]`.
   - `a[2]` will be `500 + x[0] + x[1]`.
   - `a[3]` will be `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.
   - And so on, up to `a[n-1]` which will be `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 4` and `x = [10, 20, 30]` for a concrete example:
- `a[0]` is 500.
- `a[1]` is `500 + x[0] = 500 + 10 = 510`.
- `a[2]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1] = 500 + 10 + 20 = 530`.
- `a[3]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] = 500 + 10 + 20 + 30 = 560`.

So, `a` would be `[500, 510, 530, 560]`.

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `x` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the cumulative sums of `x`.

Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2] (where `x` is a list of integers and `n` is the input integer greater than 0)**
