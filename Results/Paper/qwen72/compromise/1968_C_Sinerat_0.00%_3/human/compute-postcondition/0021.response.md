Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with `a[0]` set to 500, `a[1]` set to `500 + x[0]`, and `a[2]` set to `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, `x` is a list of integers.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[2]` is updated to `a[1] + x[1]`.
- Given that `a[1]` is `500 + x[0]`, `a[2]` becomes `500 + x[0] + x[1]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` still has `n` elements, but now `a[2]` has been updated.
