Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500, `x` is a list of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer greater than 0.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`.
- The list `a` now contains `n` integers. The first element `a[0]` is still 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]`.
- The list `x` remains unchanged.
