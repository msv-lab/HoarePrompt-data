Functionality: **The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`. The function does not explicitly accept these parameters but rather handles them through a predefined structure or external method. For each test case, `n` is an integer where `2 <= n <= 500`, and `x` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
