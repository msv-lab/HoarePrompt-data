Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is set to `a[2] + x[2]`**

The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[3]` to be the sum of `a[2]` and `x[2]`. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated value of `a[3]`.
