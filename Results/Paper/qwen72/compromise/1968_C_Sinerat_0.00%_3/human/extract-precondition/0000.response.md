Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle input through a predefined structure or external method not shown in the function definition. Typically, it would involve reading multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` where `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.**
