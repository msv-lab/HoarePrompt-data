You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle input through a predefined structure or external method not shown in the function definition. Typically, it would involve reading multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` where `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: After all iterations, the variable `t` (number of test cases) is reduced to 0, and for each test case, the variable `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500, and `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`. For each test case, it generates a list `a` of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the number of test cases `t` is implicitly reduced to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\), and 500 is within this range.

2. **Construction of `a[i]` for \(i \geq 1\):**
   - The program constructs `a[i]` as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
   - This ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\), because:
     - \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\)
     - Therefore, \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}\).

3. **Constraints Check:**
   - The values of `a[i]` are constructed by adding `x[i-1]` to `a[i-1]`, which means `a[i]` will always be greater than or equal to `a[i-1] + 1`.
   - Since \(1 \le x_i \le 500\), the maximum value of `a[i]` will be \(500 + (n-1) \times 500\), which is \(500n\).
   - Given \(n \le 500\), the maximum value of `a[i]` will be \(500 \times 500 = 250000\), which is well within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a` for each test case, which is the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
