### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and then reads and sorts the lists `a` and `b` as required.

2. **Sorting and Pairing:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The list `b` is sorted in descending order and then the first `m` elements are taken (though this step is redundant since `b` is already of length `m`).

3. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The program initially pairs elements from the start of `a` with elements from the start of `b` in descending order.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element from the end of `b` is greater than the difference with the current element of `b`.
   - If such a point is found, it switches to pairing elements from the start of `a` with elements from the end of `b` for the remaining elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same as in the second example.
   - It also handles cases where `m` is equal to `n` and where `m` is greater than `n`.

6. **Optimization:**
   - The approach of sorting `a` and `b` and then pairing elements to maximize the absolute difference is a valid strategy. By sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, the program ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.

7. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary confirms that the program processes the test cases as described and outputs the correct results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary. It follows the logic of maximizing the total difference `D` by sorting and strategically pairing elements from `a` and `b`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
