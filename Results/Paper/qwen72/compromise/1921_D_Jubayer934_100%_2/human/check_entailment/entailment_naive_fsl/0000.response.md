Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of elements in array `b` is equal to `n`. In such a case, the program should consider all elements in `b` to maximize the difference, but the current implementation only considers the first `n` elements of `b` in reverse order, which might not always yield the maximum difference.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
6 5 4
```
The expected output should be 12, as Vasya can create the array `c = [6, 5, 4]` to maximize the difference:
```
D = |1-6| + |2-5| + |3-4| = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9
```
However, the program will output 9, which is incorrect. The issue arises because the program does not correctly handle the case where `m == n` and the elements in `b` are already in a descending order.
