### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and initializes `temp` to -1.
   - It reads and sorts Petya's array `a` in ascending order and Vasya's available integers `b` in descending order.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the absolute differences between corresponding elements.
   - This ensures that the smallest elements of `a` are paired with the largest elements of `b` initially, which helps in maximizing the differences.

3. **Initial Pairing:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `b` (since `m >= n` and we only need `n` elements from `b`).
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in `b` and appends it to `ans`.

4. **Optimal Pairing Adjustment:**
   - The function checks if there is a better way to pair the elements of `a` with the elements of `b` by comparing the absolute differences of the current pairing with the reverse pairing.
   - If the reverse pairing (`b[-(n - i)]`) results in a larger absolute difference, it stops the initial pairing and starts the reverse pairing from that point.
   - This adjustment ensures that the function maximizes the total difference `D`.

5. **Summing the Differences:**
   - After all the absolute differences are calculated and stored in `ans`, the function prints the sum of the differences for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The initial approach of pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` is a good starting point to maximize the absolute differences.
  - The adjustment step ensures that if the reverse pairing provides a better result, it is used instead.
  - The function correctly handles the constraints and the multiple test cases.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles cases where all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case where `b` is all 1s).
  - It also handles cases where `n` is equal to `m` and where `n` is less than `m`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting operations are efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(m \log m)\).
  - The overall complexity is \(O(t \cdot (n \log n + m \log m))\), which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Annotated Code Verification:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 100\), representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \le n \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).
  - `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where \(1 \le b_i \le 10^9\).

- **State After Reading and Sorting:**
  - `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
  - `b` is a sorted list of the first `m` integers from the input in descending order.
  - `temp` is initialized to -1.
  - `ans` is an empty list.

- **State After Initial Pairing:**
  - `ans` contains the absolute differences between the first `i` elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` in descending order.
  - If `temp` is not -1, it indicates that the reverse pairing should be used for the remaining elements.

- **State After Optimal Pairing Adjustment:**
  - If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is updated to include the absolute differences between the remaining elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` in reverse order.
  - The function prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. The approach of sorting and adjusting the pairing to maximize the absolute differences is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
