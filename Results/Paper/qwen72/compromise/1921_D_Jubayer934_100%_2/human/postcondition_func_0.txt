The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` in a specific order: initially, it pairs elements from the start of `a` with elements from the start of `b` in descending order. If at any point the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element from the end of `b` is greater than the difference with the current element of `b`, it switches to pairing elements from the start of `a` with elements from the end of `b` for the remaining elements. The function prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the final state includes the processed lists `a` and `b` for each test case, and the list `ans` containing the absolute differences.
