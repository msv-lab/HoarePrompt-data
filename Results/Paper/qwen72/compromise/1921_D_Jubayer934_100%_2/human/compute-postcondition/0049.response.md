Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 1.**

The code snippet appends the value `abs(a[1] - b[1])` to the list `ans`, which initially contained `abs(a[0] - b[0])`. The values of `t`, `a_i`, and `temp` remain -1, and the other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
