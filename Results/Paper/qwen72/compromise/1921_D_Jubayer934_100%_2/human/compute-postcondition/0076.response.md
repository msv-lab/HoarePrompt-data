Postcondition: ***`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is an empty list. If the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[-n]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, then `temp` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.***
