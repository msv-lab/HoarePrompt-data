To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(temp, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i`, `temp`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `temp` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is -1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `a_i` is -1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `n-1` (not relevant to the loop head, but it will be reassigned in the loop)
- `m` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input (not relevant to the loop head)
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer (relevant to the loop head)
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `temp` is not -1 (relevant to the loop head)

For the loop to execute, `temp` must be less than `n`. Since `temp` is not -1, it must be a valid integer that is less than `n`.

State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`**
