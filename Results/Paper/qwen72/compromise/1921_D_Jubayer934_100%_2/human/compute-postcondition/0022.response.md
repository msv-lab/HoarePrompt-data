Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is not met, `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, or -1 if the condition is never met, and `i` is the last index where the loop executed, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke.**

In natural language:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, representing the number of test cases.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in `a` and `b` respectively.
- The list `a_i` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9.
- The list `b` remains a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- The input must still be greater than 0.
- The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is not met.
- The variable `temp` will be the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, or it will remain -1 if the condition is never met.
- The variable `i` will be the last index where the loop executed, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke due to the condition being met.
