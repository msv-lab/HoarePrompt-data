Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. `i` is set to `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke. `temp` remains the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, and it is not -1. If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is the last index where the loop executed, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, or -1 if the condition never becomes true. `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, ..., up to the point where the loop completes all `n` iterations if `temp` is not -1. If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains the list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations. `n` is the number of elements in list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, and `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the value of `i` where the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `temp` is not -1, then `i` is `n`, `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`, and `ans` also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
