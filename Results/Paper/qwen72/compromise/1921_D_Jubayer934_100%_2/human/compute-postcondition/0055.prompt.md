Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t`, `a_i`, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `a_i`, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[-(n - 0)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, then `temp` is set to `0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1 or 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, and `abs(a[2] - b[2])`, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
