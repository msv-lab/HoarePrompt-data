### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - After cutting, he can rotate and rearrange the two resulting rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - The goal is to determine if the new rectangle formed is different from the original rectangle, considering that \(a \times b\) and \(b \times a\) are the same.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal smaller rectangles.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - If \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side. The new rectangle will have dimensions \(a \times 2b\) or \(2a \times b\).

3. **Checking if the New Rectangle is Different:**
   - The new rectangle will be different from the original if the dimensions of the new rectangle are not the same as the original rectangle.
   - Specifically, if \(a\) is even and \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \), the new rectangle \(a \times 2b\) will be different.
   - Similarly, if \(b\) is even and \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \), the new rectangle \(2a \times b\) will be different.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "No".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program correctly prints "No" because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, the program correctly handles it by checking if the other dimension is even and different from 1.

6. **Annotated Code Review:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the program's behavior.
   - The loop iterates \(t\) times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the input.
   - The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and can be split into two equal parts that are not equal to the other dimension.
   - If this condition is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
   - If both dimensions are odd, it directly prints "No".
   - The values of \(t\), \(a\), and \(b\) remain unchanged after the function execution, but the loop has completed its execution and the corresponding output has been printed for each test case.

7. **Validation of Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and edge cases.
   - The program correctly handles the conditions for forming a new rectangle.
   - The program correctly prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions described.
   - The program's behavior matches the problem description and the annotated code.
