Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string and then calculates the length of the segment that needs to be painted. However, this approach fails to account for the possibility that the segment between the first and last 'B' might not be the minimal segment that needs to be painted to make the entire strip white.

For example, consider the test case "WBBWBW". The program will find the first 'B' at index 1 and the last 'B' at index 5, and it will output the length as \(6 - 5 - 1 = 0\), which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 4, as painting the segment from index 1 to index 4 (inclusive) will make the entire strip white.

A correct approach would be to find the first and last 'B' and then calculate the length of the segment between them, including both 'B's. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        ind1 = s.find('B')
        ind2 = s.rfind('B')
        print(ind2 - ind1 + 1)
```

This version correctly finds the indices of the first and last 'B' and calculates the length of the segment that needs to be painted.
