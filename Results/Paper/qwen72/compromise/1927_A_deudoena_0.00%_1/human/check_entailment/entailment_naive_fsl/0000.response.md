Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem description specifies that there will be multiple test cases, each with its own input. The provided program only reads a single string and processes it, ignoring the number of test cases and the length of the strip for each test case. This means the program will fail for any input that contains multiple test cases.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the strip is already entirely white. According to the problem description, if the strip is already all white, the output should be 0. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly output the length of the strip.

Example of incorrect behavior:
For the input:
```
2
3
WWW
4
BWWB
```
The expected output is:
```
0
2
```
But the program will output:
```
3
2
```
This is incorrect because the first test case should output 0 since the strip is already all white.
