The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function returns a string indicating whether the string `s` can be transformed into a string of all 'B's by flipping any 'W' to 'B' at most once. If the transformation is possible, the function returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with at least one 'B'. It returns a list of strings, each indicating "Yes" if the corresponding string `s` can be transformed into a string of all 'B's by flipping any 'W' to 'B' at most once, or "No" otherwise.**
