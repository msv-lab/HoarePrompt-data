Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string `inpstr` from the user input, finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' (`ind1`) and the index of the last occurrence of 'B' (`ind2`), and prints the difference between the length of the string and the sum of these indices (`len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`). The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state. **
