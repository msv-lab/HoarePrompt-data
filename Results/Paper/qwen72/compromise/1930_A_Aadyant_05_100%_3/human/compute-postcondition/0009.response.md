The only objects in the loop head are the variable `str` and the list `list1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list1`. If `list1` has at least one word, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace, and `str` is not yet defined. For the loop to execute, `list1` must have at least one word, and `str` will be the first word in `list1` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace that must have at least one word, `str` is the first word in `list1`**
