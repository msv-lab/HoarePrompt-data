Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2` (which is 0 since `list2` is empty), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b`, `str` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words and assigns it to `list1`.
- The other variables (`n`, `num`, `final`, `s`, `str`, `i`, `list2`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
- `final` is still a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, which is 0 because `list2` is empty.
- `list1` now contains the words from the user input `b`, split by whitespace.
