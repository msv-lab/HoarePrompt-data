Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a line of input containing space-separated integers, converts them to a list of integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices. It then appends this sum to a list `final`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `final` on a new line. The function does not return any value. **
