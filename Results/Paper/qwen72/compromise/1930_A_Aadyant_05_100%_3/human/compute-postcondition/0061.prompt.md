Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be an integer greater than 2, `num` is 2, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` (which is 0), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting `b` by spaces, `i` is -1, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the user input, `b` is the new user input.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be an integer greater than 2, `num` is 2, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` (which is 0), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting `b` by spaces and must have at least one string, `str` is the first string in `list1`, `i` is -1, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the new user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be an integer greater than 2, `num` is 2, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` (which is 0), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting `b` by spaces and must have at least two strings, `str` is the second string in `list1`, `i` is -1, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1` and the integer value of the second string in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the new user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be an integer greater than 2, `num` is 2, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` (which is 0), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting `b` by spaces and must have at least three strings, `str` is the third string in `list1`, `i` is -1, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, the integer value of the second string in `list1`, and the integer value of the third string in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the new user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
