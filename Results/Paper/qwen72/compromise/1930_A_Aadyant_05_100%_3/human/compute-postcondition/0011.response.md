The only objects in the loop head are `str` and `list1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `list1`. If `list1` has more than one word, the loop will execute again for the next word. At the end of the last iteration, `list1` had at least one word, and `str` was the first word in `list1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `list1` must have at least two words. The next iteration will set `str` to the second word in `list1`.

State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1`, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace that must have at least two words, `str` is the second word in `list1`**
