Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2` (which is now 0 since `list2` initially contains one element), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least 2 words, `str` is the second word in `list1`, `i` is 1, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1` and the integer value of the second word in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.**

Explanation:
- `list2` initially contains the integer value of the first word in `list1`.
- The code `list2.append(int(str))` appends the integer value of `str` (which is the second word in `list1`) to `list2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
