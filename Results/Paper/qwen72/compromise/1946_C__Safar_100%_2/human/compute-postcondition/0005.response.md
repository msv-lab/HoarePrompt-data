Output State: **`A` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges, `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1**

The code snippet `x, p = stack[-1]` assigns the values from the last tuple in the list `stack` to the variables `x` and `p`. Since `stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, `x` is assigned the value `1` and `p` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables (`A`, `stack`, `visited`, `d`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
