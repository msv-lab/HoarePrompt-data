Postcondition: ***`A` is a positive integer, `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1). If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` also contains the tuple (node, 1). `visited` is a set containing the integer 1, `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `x` is in `visited`, and `g[x]` must be a collection with at least 2 elements, and `node` is the second element in `g[x]`.***
