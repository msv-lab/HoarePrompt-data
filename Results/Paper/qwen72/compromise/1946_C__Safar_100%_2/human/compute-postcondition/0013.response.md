To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case is `node` and `g[x]`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `A` is a positive integer.
- `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1). If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` also contains the tuple (node, 1).
- `visited` is a set containing the integer 1.
- `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1.
- `r` is 0.
- `x` is 1.
- `p` is 1.
- `x` is in `visited`.
- `g[x]` must be a non-empty collection.

### Loop Head:
```python
for node in g[x]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `g[x]`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1, and `g[x]` must be a non-empty collection.
- The loop can execute again if there are more elements in `g[x]` to iterate over.

### Adjustments:
- The variable `node` will be set to the next element in `g[x]`.
- The state of `g[x]` must remain such that it has at least one more element to iterate over.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `A` is a positive integer.
- `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1). If the next `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` will also contain the tuple (next `node`, 1).
- `visited` is a set containing the integer 1.
- `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1.
- `r` is 0.
- `x` is 1.
- `p` is 1.
- `x` is in `visited`.
- `g[x]` must be a collection with at least 2 elements, and `node` is the second element in `g[x]`.

### Final State:
State: **`A` is a positive integer, `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1). If the next `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` also contains the tuple (next `node`, 1). `visited` is a set containing the integer 1, `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `x` is in `visited`, and `g[x]` must be a collection with at least 2 elements, and `node` is the second element in `g[x]`.**
