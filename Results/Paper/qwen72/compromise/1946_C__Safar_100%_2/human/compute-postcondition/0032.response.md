Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `edges` is a list of tuples \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\).
   - `g` is a list of \(n + 1\) lists where each list `g[i]` contains the indices of all vertices connected to vertex `i` by an edge in the tree.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l - 1)` is false and `check(l)` is true.
   - `r` is `l - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(r)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `r` is defined as `l - 1`.
   - `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l - 1)` is false and `check(l)` is true.
   - This means that `l` is the first integer where the `check` function transitions from false to true.
   - Therefore, `r` will be the integer just before `l` where `check(r)` is false.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `r` is `l - 1`, and `l` is the smallest integer where `check(l - 1)` is false and `check(l)` is true, the print statement will output the integer `r` which is the largest integer where `check(r)` is false.

Output: **r (where r is the largest integer such that check(r) is false)**
