The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a positive integer `k` (1 <= k < n) representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of the tree. It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree and then performs a binary search to find the largest integer `r` such that the function `check(r)` returns false. The function prints this integer `r` and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the adjacency list `g` and the integer `r` which is the largest value for which `check(r)` is false.
