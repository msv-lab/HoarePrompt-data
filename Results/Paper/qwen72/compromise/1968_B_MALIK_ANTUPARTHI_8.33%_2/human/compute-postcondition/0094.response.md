Output State: **`b` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `k` is `e.index(d[2]) + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is determined by the expression `e.index(d[2]) + 1`. The value of `j` is 2, so `d[2]` is used to find its index in the list `e`, and then 1 is added to this index. The values of `b` and `j` remain unchanged.
