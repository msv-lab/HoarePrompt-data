Postcondition: ***`b` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is `e.index(d[1]) + 1`. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the element at index `j` in list `d` is not in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
