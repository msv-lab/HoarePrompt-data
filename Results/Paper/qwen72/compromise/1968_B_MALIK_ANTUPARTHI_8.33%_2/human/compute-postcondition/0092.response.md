Postcondition: ***`b` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[1]) + 1`. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
