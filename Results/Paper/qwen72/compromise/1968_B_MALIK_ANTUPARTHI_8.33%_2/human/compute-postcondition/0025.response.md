The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. The value of `b` must still be greater than `j` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
