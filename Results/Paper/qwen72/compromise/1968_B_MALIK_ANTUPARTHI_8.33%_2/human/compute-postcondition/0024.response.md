Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
