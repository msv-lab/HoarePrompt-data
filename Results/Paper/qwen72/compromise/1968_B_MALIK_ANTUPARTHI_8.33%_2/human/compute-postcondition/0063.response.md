Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 2, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is a new input value, `j` is 2. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
