Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, and `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and neither `k` is equal to `c` nor `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1. In all cases, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
