Output State: **`b` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `j + 1` (which is 2). If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the element at index `j` in list `d` is not in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
