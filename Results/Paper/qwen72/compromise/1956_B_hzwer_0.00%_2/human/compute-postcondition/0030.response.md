To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), so for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3 (as given in the state), and `j` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cases` is a list of tuples.
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop.
- `i` is `-1`.
- `j` is `0`.

The loop head is:
```
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be at least 3 (this is already given and does not need adjustment).
- `j` must be initialized to `n - 1` for the loop to start correctly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` should be `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 1`**.
