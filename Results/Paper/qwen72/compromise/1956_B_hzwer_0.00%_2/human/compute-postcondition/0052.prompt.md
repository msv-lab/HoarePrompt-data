Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 1`. If `j + 1` does not appear in the list `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[-1][n - 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[0][n - 1]` and `dp[1][n - 2] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[-1][n - 1]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[0][n - 1]`, `dp[1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[0][n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 2`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, `dp[-1][n - 2]` is set to `dp[0][n - 2]`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[-1][n - 2]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[0][n - 2]` and `dp[1][n - 3] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[-1][n - 2]` is the maximum of `dp[0][n - 2]`, `dp[1][n - 3] + 1`, and `dp[0][n - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 3`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Otherwise, if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[-1][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[0][n - 3]` and `dp[1][n - 4] + 1`. If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, `dp[-1][n - 3]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
