Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is n - 1, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, and the integer `j + 1` does not appear in the list `cards`.**
