Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is now `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` if `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)` if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`. `dp[i][j]` is now `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`.**
