The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, `i` must start at `n - 3` and decrement to 0. This means `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute at least once. The initial value of `i` is `n - 3`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `i` is `n - 3`**
