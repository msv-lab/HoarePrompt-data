Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `cards` from the input. It then applies a dynamic programming algorithm to determine the maximum number of cards that can be selected from the list `cards` such that no two selected cards have the same value. The function returns this maximum number as an integer. The function does not modify the input variables or any external state. **
