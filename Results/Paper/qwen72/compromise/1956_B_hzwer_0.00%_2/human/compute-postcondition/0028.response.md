Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop. The loop updates the elements of `dp` starting from `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` and moving towards `dp[0][0]`. For each `i` from `n - 3` to `0`, and for each `j` from `n - 1` to `0`, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `dp` table will have been fully populated from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner. Each cell `dp[i][j]` will contain the maximum value based on the conditions specified in the loop, and the loop will have finished with `i` and `j` both set to `0`. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `n`, and `cards`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
