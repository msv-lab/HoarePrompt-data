Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the `dp` table is fully populated according to the rules specified in the loop. The variable `t` remains an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `cases` remains unchanged. The integer `n` remains the input integer, and the list `cards` remains the list of integers read from the input. The variable `i` is -1, and `j` is -1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has run through all its iterations, starting from `i = n - 3` and ending at `i = 0`.
- For each value of `i` from `n - 3` down to `0`, and for each value of `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`, the `dp` table has been updated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list.
- If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- After the loop completes, `i` and `j` are both -1, indicating that the loop has finished its execution.
- The variables `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `cards` remain unchanged from their initial states.
