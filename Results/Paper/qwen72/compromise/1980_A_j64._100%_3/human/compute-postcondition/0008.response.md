The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns the total number of additional problems needed to make the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' at least `m`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `count` remains the same list of 7 integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `a`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string.**
