Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is 0 after the loop, and `s` is calculated and printed for each iteration as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, where `l` is taken as input for each iteration.** 

In natural language, the initial value of `n` is set to an integer value provided by the user. The number of test cases `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration of the loop, `n` is decreased by 1, and `s` is calculated based on the input `l` and then printed. After the loop completes, `n` is 0. The value of `s` for each iteration depends on the input `l` and is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`.
