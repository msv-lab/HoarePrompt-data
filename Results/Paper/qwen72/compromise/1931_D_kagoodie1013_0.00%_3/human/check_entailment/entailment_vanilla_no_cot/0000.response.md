Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it counts the beautiful pairs. Specifically, the logic for counting pairs where both conditions are met simultaneously is incorrect. The program incorrectly adds the counts from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each number, which does not ensure that both conditions (divisibility by `x` and `y`) are satisfied for the same pair of indices.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that for each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(i < j\)), both \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). This requires a more careful approach to count the pairs that satisfy both conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(i < j\)) and checks both conditions for each pair. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the count. This approach ensures that the pairs are correctly counted.

However, this solution has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which may not be efficient for large inputs. A more optimized approach would involve using a combination of hash maps to precompute the necessary conditions and then count the pairs efficiently. Here is an optimized version:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_map = {}
        for i in range(n):
            mod_x = arr[i] % x
            mod_y = arr[i] % y
            for (mod_x_j, mod_y_j) in mod_map:
                if (mod_x + mod_x_j) % x == 0 and (mod_y - mod_y_j) % y == 0:
                    count += mod_map[(mod_x_j, mod_y_j)]
            mod_map[(mod_x, mod_y)] = mod_map.get((mod_x, mod_y), 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This optimized version uses a single hash map `mod_map` to store the counts of pairs of remainders \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\). For each element in the array, it checks if there exists another element in the map that, when combined, satisfies both conditions. This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and is more efficient for large inputs.
