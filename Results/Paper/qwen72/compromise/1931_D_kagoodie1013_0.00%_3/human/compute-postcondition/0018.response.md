Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least 2 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and 1 as its value, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and 1 as its value, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mod_y_key = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y_key` to be the result of `num % y`. Since `mod_y_key` was already defined as `num % y` in the initial state, this code does not change the value of `mod_y_key`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
