Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + (mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_x_key` and value 3, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_y_key` and value 3, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` by incrementing it by 1.
- Initially, `mod_y_map` has the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 2.
- After the code execution, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is now 3.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
