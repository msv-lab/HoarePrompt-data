Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary called `mod_x_map`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
