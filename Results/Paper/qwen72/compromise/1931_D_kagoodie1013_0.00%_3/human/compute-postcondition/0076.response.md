Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + (mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0))`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_x_key` and value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_y_key` and value 1, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`.
- Since `count` was initially `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, after the increment, `count` becomes `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + (mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0))`.
- The values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` remain unchanged.
