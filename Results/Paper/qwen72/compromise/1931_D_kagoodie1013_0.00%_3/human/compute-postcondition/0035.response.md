The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. The state before the loop starts already specifies that `arr` must have at least `len(arr)` elements, which implies it has at least one element. Therefore, the loop can execute as long as `arr` is not empty.

Given that `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least one element, the loop will execute. However, for the loop to start, `num` should be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is now an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
