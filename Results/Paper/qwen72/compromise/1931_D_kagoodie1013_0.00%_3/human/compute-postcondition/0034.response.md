Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is now an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_y_map = {}` reassigns `mod_y_map` to an empty dictionary.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
