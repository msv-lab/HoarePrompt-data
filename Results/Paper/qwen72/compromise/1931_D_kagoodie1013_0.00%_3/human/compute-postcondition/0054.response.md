Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is updated to `count + mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `num % x` as a key and the value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `num % y` as a key and the value 2, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is updated by adding the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` based on the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
- `mod_x` is `-num % x`, and `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` both have the keys `num % x` and `num % y` with the value 2.
- Therefore, `count` is incremented by `2 + 2 = 4`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
