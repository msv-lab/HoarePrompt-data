Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Unique Characters Extraction**: The function `func_1` extracts the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them. This is done using a set comprehension and the `sorted` function, which is correct and efficient.

3. **Symmetric Replacement**: The program attempts to replace each character in the string `s` with its symmetric character from the sorted unique characters list. However, the logic for this replacement is flawed:
   - The program uses a single pass through the string `s` and replaces each character in place. This can lead to incorrect results because the replacement is done in a single pass, and characters that are replaced early can affect the replacements of subsequent characters.
   - The program also modifies the `unique_chars` list by inserting characters, which is not necessary for the decoding process and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Correct Decoding Logic**:
   - To decode the string, we need to map each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters list.
   - We should create a mapping from each character in `b` to its corresponding character in the sorted unique characters list and then apply this mapping to the entire string.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the symmetric replacement. It modifies the string `s` in place, which can lead to incorrect results.
   - The program also inserts characters into the `unique_chars` list, which is not part of the decoding process and can lead to incorrect results.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - Create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters list to its symmetric character.
   - Use this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string `b` to get the original string `s`.

Given the flaws in the logic for symmetric replacement and the unnecessary modifications to the `unique_chars` list, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
