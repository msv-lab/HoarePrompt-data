You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s is a positive integer such that 1 <= len(s) <= 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: All characters in `s` are replaced by the last unique character in `unique_chars` before the loop starts, and `unique_chars` contains all the characters that were originally in `s`, sorted in the order they appeared in `s` before the loop started. `i` is the length of `unique_chars`, and `j` is 0.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string containing all the unique characters from `s`, sorted in the order they appeared in `s` before the loop started.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` and returns a string containing all the unique characters from `s`, in the order they first appeared.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string containing all the unique characters from `s`, sorted in the order they appeared in `s` before the loop started.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
