The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all the unique characters from `s`, in the order they first appeared. The function modifies the input string `s` by replacing each character with the last unique character in the sorted list of unique characters from `s`. However, the final state of the program is such that the returned string is a sorted list of unique characters from `s`, in the order they appeared in the original string.
