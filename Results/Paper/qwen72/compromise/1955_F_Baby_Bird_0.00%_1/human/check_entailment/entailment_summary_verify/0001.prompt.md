You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of four integers from the input, modifies each integer to be even, and then calculates and prints an integer that is the sum of the number of odd integers in the first three elements of the modified list (which can only be 0 or 3) and half the sum of all elements in the modified list (rounded down). The function does not return any value, and the initial state of the input variables remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the input provides the counts of these numbers.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the sequence can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has a zero XOR as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of identical numbers (or making the counts of numbers even) helps in achieving a zero XOR.

4. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It then processes these counts:
     - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` converts each count to the nearest even number by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2.
     - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` checks if the first three counts (1, 2, 3) are all odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the result.
     - `sum(p) // 2` calculates the total number of pairs that can be formed from the even counts.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of pairs that can be formed from the even counts.
   - The condition `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` is used to handle the case where the first three counts are all odd. This ensures that Bob wins at least once if the initial sequence has an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - The final result is the sum of these two parts, which correctly gives the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
