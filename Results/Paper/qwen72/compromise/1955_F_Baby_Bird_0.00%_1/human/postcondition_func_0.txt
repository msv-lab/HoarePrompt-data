The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of four integers from the input, modifies each integer to be even, and then calculates and prints an integer that is the sum of the number of odd integers in the first three elements of the modified list (which can only be 0 or 3) and half the sum of all elements in the modified list (rounded down). The function does not return any value, and the initial state of the input variables remains unchanged.
