Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 2, the output will be:

Output: **2**
