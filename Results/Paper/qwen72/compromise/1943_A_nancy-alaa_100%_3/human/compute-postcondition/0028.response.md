Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of `_`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `i` is 2 and the properties of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain valid.
