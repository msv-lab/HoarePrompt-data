Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 1, and `first` is False. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True. If `mpp[i]` is not 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
