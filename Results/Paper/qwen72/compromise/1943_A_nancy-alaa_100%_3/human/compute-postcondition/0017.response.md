The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is False. 

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 1**
