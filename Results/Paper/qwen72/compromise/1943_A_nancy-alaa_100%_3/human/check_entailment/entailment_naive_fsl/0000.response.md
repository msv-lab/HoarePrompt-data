Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. The program simply checks for the first missing integer and prints it, which does not necessarily reflect the optimal play by both players. 

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```
The optimal play should result in the MEX of 4, but the program will output 4 prematurely, not considering the optimal moves by both players. The correct optimal play would be:
1. Alice picks 2 (array becomes [0, 1, 2, 3], c becomes [2]).
2. Bob picks 0 (array becomes [1, 2, 3], c remains [2]).
3. Alice picks 1 (array becomes [2, 3], c becomes [2, 1]).
4. Bob picks 2 (array becomes [3], c remains [2, 1]).
5. Alice picks 3 (array becomes [], c becomes [2, 1, 3]).

At the end, c = [2, 1, 3], and the MEX is 0. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.
