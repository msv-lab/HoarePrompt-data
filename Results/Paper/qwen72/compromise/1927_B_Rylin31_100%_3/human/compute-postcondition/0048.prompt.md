Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, a valid string s exists.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at each index `j` in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`, and all other elements are 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element; `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by the length of `array`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with the elements at the indices specified by `array` incremented by the number of times each index appears in `array`, and all other elements still initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the elements in `s` at the indices specified by `array` plus 97, concatenated in the order the indices appear in `array`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
