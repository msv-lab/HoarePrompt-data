Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- The variable `l` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- The list `s` is now a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the elements in `array`. These elements are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`.
- The list `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element.
- The string `ans` contains the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.
- The variable `i` is incremented by the length of `array`.
- The input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.
