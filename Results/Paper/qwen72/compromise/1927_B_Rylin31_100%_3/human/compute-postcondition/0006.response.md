Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, and the input value must be greater than 0; `l` is an input integer greater than 0; `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element; `j` is the first element of `array`; `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to include the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- Since `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `s[j]` will be 0.
- Therefore, `ans` will be the character corresponding to `0 + 97`, which is 'a'.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
