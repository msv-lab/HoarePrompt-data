You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, a valid string s exists.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ans = ''
        
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the elements in `s` at the indices specified by `array` plus 97, concatenated in the order the indices appear in `array`. After all iterations, `i` has reached the value of `t`, and all test cases have been processed, with the final `ans` string printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
