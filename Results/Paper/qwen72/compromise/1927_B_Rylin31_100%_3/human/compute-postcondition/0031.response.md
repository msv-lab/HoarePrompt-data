Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
5. For each test case, a valid string `s` exists.
6. `l` is an input integer greater than 0.
7. `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`.
8. `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element.
9. `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`.
10. `i` is incremented by the length of `array`.
11. The input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`array`**: This is a list of integers provided by the user. Each element in `array` is an index into the list `s`.
2. **`s`**: This is a list of length `l` where all elements are initially 0. For each element `j` in `array`, the corresponding element in `s` (i.e., `s[j]`) is incremented by 1.
3. **`ans`**: This is a string constructed by converting each element `j` in `array` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`. Since `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `s[j]` will be the count of `j` in `array`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `array = [2, 3, 2, 1]` and `l = 4`.
- Initially, `s = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- After processing `array`:
  - `s[2]` is incremented by 2 (since 2 appears twice in `array`).
  - `s[3]` is incremented by 1 (since 3 appears once in `array`).
  - `s[1]` is incremented by 1 (since 1 appears once in `array`).
- So, `s` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 1]`.
- Now, `ans` is constructed by converting each element `j` in `array` to the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97`:
  - For `j = 2`, `s[2] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99` which corresponds to the character 'c'.
  - For `j = 3`, `s[3] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98` which corresponds to the character 'b'.
  - For `j = 2`, `s[2] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99` which corresponds to the character 'c'.
  - For `j = 1`, `s[1] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98` which corresponds to the character 'b'.
- Therefore, `ans` will be the string `'cbcb'`.

### General Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print a string where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`. The value of `s[j]` is the count of `j` in `array`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string containing characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, and `s[j]` is the count of `j` in `array`)**
