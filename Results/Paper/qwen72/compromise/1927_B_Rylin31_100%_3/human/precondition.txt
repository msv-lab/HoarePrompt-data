t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for each trace, there exists a suitable string s.
