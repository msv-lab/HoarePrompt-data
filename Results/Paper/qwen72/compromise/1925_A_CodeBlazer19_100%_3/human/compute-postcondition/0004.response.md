Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 26` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 26`. It then prints a string that consists of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The values of `n` and `k` are not retained between iterations, and `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
