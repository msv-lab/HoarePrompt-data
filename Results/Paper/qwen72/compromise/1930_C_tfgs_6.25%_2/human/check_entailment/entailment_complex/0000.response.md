### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then loops through each test case using `for _ in range(t): func_1()`.

2. **Reading Input for Each Test Case:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers. This is done correctly using `n = int(input())` and `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`.

3. **Modifying the Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]` for all `0 â‰¤ i < n`. This step is correct and aligns with the problem description where `a_i + i` is inserted into the set `S`.

4. **Handling Duplicates and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the modified `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This is correct because the set `S` should only contain unique elements, and we need the elements in descending order to construct the lexicographically largest array `b`.

5. **Constructing the Array `ans`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` and a variable `cnt` to keep track of the number of elements that need to be added to `ans` to make its length equal to `n`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and tries to insert the largest possible integers between these elements without violating the uniqueness and descending order.
   - The `adv` variable is used to calculate how many additional elements can be inserted between `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` without violating the conditions. This is done by taking the minimum of `a[i-1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i-1]]`.
   - The program then appends these additional elements to `ans` and updates `cnt` and `counter`.

6. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - After processing all unique elements, if there are still remaining positions to fill (`cnt > 0`), the program appends the largest possible integers that are one less than the previous element, ensuring the final length of `ans` is `n`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` in a single line separated by spaces, which is the correct format for the output.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input, modifies the array, constructs the set, and generates the lexicographically largest array `b` by ensuring uniqueness and descending order. The additional elements are inserted in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
