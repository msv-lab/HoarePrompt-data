Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the process of selecting an index, inserting the value `a[i] + i` into the set, and then deleting `a[i]` from the array. Instead, it directly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element and then sorts the set in reverse order.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3 2
```

However, the program does not correctly handle the following case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
6 4 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
11 7 6
```

**Actual Output:**
```
11 7 6
```

The program seems to produce the correct output for these specific examples, but it does not follow the described process of selecting an index, inserting the value, and deleting the element. The problem requires the array `a` to be modified after each operation, and the set `S` to be updated accordingly. The given program does not simulate this process, and thus it is incorrect.

To illustrate the issue more clearly, consider a different input:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5 4 3 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5 4 3 2
```

The expected output is derived by following the steps:
1. Select `i=4`, insert `4 + 4 = 8` into `S`, delete `4` from `a`.
2. Select `i=3`, insert `3 + 3 = 6` into `S`, delete `3` from `a`.
3. Select `i=2`, insert `2 + 2 = 4` into `S`, delete `2` from `a`.
4. Select `i=1`, insert `1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, delete `1` from `a`.

The set `S` will be `{8, 6, 4, 2}`, and the sorted array `b` will be `[8, 6, 4, 2]`.

However, the program does not follow this process and instead directly modifies the array `a` and sorts the set, which is not the correct approach. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
