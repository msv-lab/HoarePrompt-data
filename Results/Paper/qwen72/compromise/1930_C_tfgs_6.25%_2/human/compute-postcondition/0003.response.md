Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[0]` is incremented by `i + 1`, which is `0 + 1` (since `i` is 0).
- Therefore, `a[0]` is increased by 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and the rest of the list `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
