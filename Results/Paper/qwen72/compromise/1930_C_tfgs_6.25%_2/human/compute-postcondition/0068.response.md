Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]` for all `0 â‰¤ i < n`. Then, it generates a new list `ans` that contains all unique elements from the modified `a` in descending order, along with additional integers that are the largest possible values that can be inserted between these unique elements without violating the uniqueness and descending order. If there are still remaining positions to fill, it appends the largest possible integers that are one less than the previous element, ensuring the final length of `ans` is `n`. The function prints the elements of `ans` in a single line separated by spaces. **
