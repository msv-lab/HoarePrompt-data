To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `adv`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is initialized to `adv - 1` before the loop starts. However, in the loop head, `j` is expected to start from 0 and iterate up to `adv - 1` (inclusive). Therefore, `j` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `adv`**: This variable is already defined and calculated before the loop starts. The loop will execute if `adv` is greater than 0. The state provided already ensures that `adv` is calculated based on the conditions given, so no adjustment is needed for `adv` itself, but we need to ensure that `adv` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv, a[i]`, `j` is 0, `counter[a[i]]` is `counter[a[i]] - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `ans` has `adv` new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`**
