Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is equal to `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`.
- Before execution, `ans` already contained the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- After execution, `ans` now contains two instances of the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `counter`, `cnt`, `i`, and `adv` remain unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains 1.
