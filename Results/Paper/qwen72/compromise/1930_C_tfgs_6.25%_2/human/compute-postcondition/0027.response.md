Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`. If `i` > 0, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is updated to `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`, `cnt` is updated to `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv`, and `j` is set to `adv - 1`. `i` is greater than 0, and `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. `ans` now contains the values `a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv, a[i]`.**
