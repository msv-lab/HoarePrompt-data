Output State: **`j` is 2, `adv` must be greater than 2, `ans` has three new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, and `a[i - 1] - 3`**

The value of `j` remains 2, `adv` is still required to be greater than 2, and the list `ans` now includes three new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, and `a[i - 1] - 3`.
