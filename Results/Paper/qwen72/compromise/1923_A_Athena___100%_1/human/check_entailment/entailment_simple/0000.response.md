### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the cells `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The function removes leading zeros from the list `a` using a while loop: `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - The function removes trailing zeros from the list `a` using another while loop: `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - This step is crucial because it ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment of the ribbon that has chips, and any free cells outside this segment are ignored.

3. **Counting Zeros**:
   - The function then iterates through the remaining list `a` and counts the number of zeros.
   - The number of zeros in the list `a` represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. This is because each zero in the list represents a free cell that needs to be filled by moving a chip to the left.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result `res` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Number of zeros: `1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
  - Number of zeros: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Number of zeros: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Number of zeros: `2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Number of zeros: `3`
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem by removing leading and trailing zeros and counting the remaining zeros, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips. The logic and the output for the given examples are correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
