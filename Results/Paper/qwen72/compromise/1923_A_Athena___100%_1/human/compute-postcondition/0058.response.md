Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2, and `res` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0 and `a[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is not 0 and `a[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is not 0, `res` remains as it was in the precondition (2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0, 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, and 0 if the first element of `a` is not 0).***
