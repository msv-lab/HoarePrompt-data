Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where all leading zeros have been removed and all trailing zeros have been removed and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `res` is 2.**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1, so `res` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
