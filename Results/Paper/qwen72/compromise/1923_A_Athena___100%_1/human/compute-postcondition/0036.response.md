Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user and `a[0]` is no longer 0 (it has been removed), `i` is the last index of the list `a`, and `res` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`.
- Initially, `a[0]` was 0, so after executing `a.pop(0)`, the first element of `a` is no longer 0.
- The list `a` is still non-empty, but it now has one fewer element.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged.
