Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). At least one cell in each test case contains a chip. The function should be called with the appropriate parameters for each test case.**
