Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**

The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
