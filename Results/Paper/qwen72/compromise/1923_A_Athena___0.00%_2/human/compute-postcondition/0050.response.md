Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `res` is 0.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: 
   - `a` is described as a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed.
   - Since `a` is non-empty, it contains at least one integer.
   - The exact values of the integers in `a` are not provided, but we know that any leading or trailing zeros have been removed.

2. **What will be printed**:
   - The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` as it is, which is a list of integers with no leading or trailing zeros.

### Final Output:
Output: **[a] (where a is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed)**
