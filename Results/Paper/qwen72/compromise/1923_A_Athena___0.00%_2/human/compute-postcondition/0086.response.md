The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, and must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must still have at least one element.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least one element, `i` is 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
