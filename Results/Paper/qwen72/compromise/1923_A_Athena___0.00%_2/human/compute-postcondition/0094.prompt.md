Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). At least one cell in each test case contains a chip. The variable `t` is now an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    print(a)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
