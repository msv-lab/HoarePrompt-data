The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, after executing this line, the last element will be removed, and `a` will no longer have 0 as its last element. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element removed (previously 0), `res` is 0**
