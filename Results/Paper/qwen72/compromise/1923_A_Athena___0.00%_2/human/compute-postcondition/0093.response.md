Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The list `a` has all leading and trailing zeros removed. This means that the list `a` only contains non-zero elements at the beginning and end, but it may still contain zeros in the middle.
   - `res` is defined as the number of zeros in the list `a`. Since leading and trailing zeros have been removed, `res` will be the count of zeros that are present within the non-zero elements of the list.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the number of zeros that are present in the list `a` after removing all leading and trailing zeros.

Given the initial state, the output will be the count of zeros in the list `a` after the specified removals.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros in the list `a` after removing all leading and trailing zeros)**
