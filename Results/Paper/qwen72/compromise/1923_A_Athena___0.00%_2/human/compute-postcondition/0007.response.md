The variables in the loop head are `a` and `a[0]`. The loop condition checks if `a` is a non-empty list and if `a[0]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` is no longer 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `a[0]` must be 0 again, and `a` must remain a non-empty list.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` must be 0, `res` is 0**
