Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged, except for `a` which is now a list of integers based on the user input.
- The value of `i` is still `len(a) - 1`, but `a` has been updated.
- The value of `res` is still the number of zeros in the list `a`, but `a` has been updated, so `res` will be recalculated based on the new list `a`.
