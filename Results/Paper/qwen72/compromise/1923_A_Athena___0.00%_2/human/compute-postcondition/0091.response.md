Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2. If the first element of `a` is 0, `res` is 1. If the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is 2. If the third element of `a` is 0, `res` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `res` is 1.***
