The variables in the loop head are `a` and the condition `a[0] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must still be non-empty, and the first element of `a` must be 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list, but `a[0]` is no longer 0 (it is now the element that was initially at index 1). Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `a[0]` must be set back to 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` must be 0, `res` is 0**
