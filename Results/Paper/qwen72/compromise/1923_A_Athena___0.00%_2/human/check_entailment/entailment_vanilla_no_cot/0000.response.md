Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Trimming the Ribbon**:
   - The program trims the leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `while` loops. This step is correct because it effectively removes the cells that are not relevant to the movement of chips.

2. **Counting Zeros**:
   - The program then counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list `a` and prints this count as the result. This approach is incorrect because the number of zeros in the trimmed list does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem, you need to find the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block. This can be done by:

1. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - Identify the positions of the first and last chip in the list `a`.

2. **Counting the Gaps**:
   - Count the number of free cells (zeros) between the first and last chip. This count will give you the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first and last chip positions
        first_chip = a.index(1)
        last_chip = n - 1 - a[::-1].index(1)
        
        # Count the number of zeros between the first and last chip
        res = a[first_chip:last_chip].count(0)
        
        print(res)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Finding the First Chip**: `first_chip = a.index(1)` finds the index of the first chip.
- **Finding the Last Chip**: `last_chip = n - 1 - a[::-1].index(1)` finds the index of the last chip by reversing the list and finding the first chip in the reversed list, then adjusting the index.
- **Counting Zeros**: `a[first_chip:last_chip].count(0)` counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem and produce the expected output for the given examples.
