You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers (0 or 1). It then removes all leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` and counts the number of zeros remaining in the list. The function prints the modified list `a` and the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last modified list with leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the last modified list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the ribbon.

2. **Trimming the Ribbon**:
   - The program trims the list `a` by removing leading and trailing zeros. This is done to focus only on the segment of the ribbon that contains chips.
   - The `while a and a[0] == 0:` loop removes leading zeros.
   - The `while a and a[-1] == 0:` loop removes trailing zeros.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - After trimming, the program counts the number of free cells (0s) within the segment that contains chips.
   - The variable `res` is used to store this count.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the trimmed list `a` and the count of free cells `res`.

5. **Logical Analysis**:
   - The goal is to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
   - The number of operations required to achieve this is equal to the number of free cells within the segment that contains chips.
   - The program correctly identifies the segment containing chips and counts the free cells within this segment.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the ribbon already contains a single block of chips (no free cells between them), the program will correctly output 0.
   - If the ribbon has no chips, the problem description guarantees that at least one cell contains a chip, so this case is not applicable.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. The trimming and counting steps are appropriate and handle the given constraints and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
