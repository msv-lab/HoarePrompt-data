The value of `n` is assigned the result of converting the user input to an integer using `int(input())`. The values of `x` and `y` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon, `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, both `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, and `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon, `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, both `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, and `n` is an input integer.**
