The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon, and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. Both `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function returns the total number of icons that would be displayed on the screen, considering the different sizes of the icons.
