Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons of two different sizes: 1 × 1 and 2 × 2. Each screen is a 5 × 3 grid, which means it has 15 cells in total. The logic in the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1 × 1 icons (`a`) and 2 × 2 icons (`b`).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2 × 2 Icons:**
   - Each 2 × 2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The program calculates the total number of cells required for all 2 × 2 icons: `b * 4`.
   - It then determines the number of screens needed for these 2 × 2 icons by dividing the total number of cells by 15 and rounding up: `t = b * 2 // 5 + (b * 2 % 5 > 0)`.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - It calculates the total number of cells used by the 2 × 2 icons: `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - It then checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1 × 1 icons (`a`).

4. **Calculating Additional Screens for 1 × 1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are not enough, it calculates the additional number of screens needed for the 1 × 1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`.
   - It then adds the number of additional screens to the total: `t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 > 0)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Incorrect Calculation for 2 × 2 Icons:**
  - The program calculates the number of screens for 2 × 2 icons as `t = b * 2 // 5 + (b * 2 % 5 > 0)`. This is incorrect because `b * 2` is the number of 2 × 2 icons, not the number of cells. The correct calculation should be based on the number of cells occupied by 2 × 2 icons, which is `b * 4`.
  - The correct calculation for the number of screens needed for 2 × 2 icons should be `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15`.

- **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining Cells:**
  - The program calculates the remaining cells as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct, but the logic to determine if additional screens are needed for 1 × 1 icons is flawed.
  - The program should directly calculate the total number of screens needed by considering both 2 × 2 and 1 × 1 icons together.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = t * 15 - b * 4
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_cells >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - remaining_cells
            t = t + (t2 + 14) // 15
        print(t)
```

Given the original program's logic, it is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
