### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows x 3 columns).
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` because each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows (since 2x2 icons can be placed in a 2x2 block, and each screen has 5 rows, so 2 rows per 2x2 icon).
   - The program then checks if `t` is divisible by 5. If it is, `t` is set to `t // 5`. If not, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`. This ensures that the number of screens is rounded up to the nearest whole number.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The calculation `t = b * 2` is incorrect. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons should be `ceil(b * 4 / 15)`, not `ceil(b * 2 / 5)`. This is because the screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons on the screens already allocated: `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - It then checks if the remaining space on these screens is enough to place all 1x1 icons (`a`). If it is, the number of screens remains `t`.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is based on the incorrect initial screen calculation. If `t` is not correctly calculated, `t1` will also be incorrect.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space is not enough for all 1x1 icons, the program calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The variable `t2` is set to `a - t1`, which represents the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the already allocated screens.
   - The program then checks if `t2` is divisible by 15. If it is, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`. If not, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1` to account for the additional screen needed.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The additional screens calculation is based on the incorrect initial screen calculation, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the given problem description. The initial screen calculation for 2x2 icons is incorrect, which affects the subsequent calculations for the remaining space and additional screens needed for 1x1 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15  # Equivalent to ceil(b * 4 / 15)
        
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Check if the remaining space is enough for all 1x1 icons
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            # Calculate the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons
            t = t + (t2 + 14) // 15  # Equivalent to ceil(t2 / 15)
        
        print(t)
```

This corrected program uses the correct formula to calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining space, ensuring the correct number of screens is printed for each test case.
