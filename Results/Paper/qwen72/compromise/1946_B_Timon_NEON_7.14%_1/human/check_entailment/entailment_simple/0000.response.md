### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - The program calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is used to ensure the final answer is within the required modulo.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is intended to find the maximum segment sum in the array `a`.
   - However, there are several issues with the implementation:
     - The `new_segment` list is initialized as an empty list and is used as if it were a list with a single element `[0]` when `arr[i]` is non-negative.
     - The `max_segment` list is initialized with `[0, 0]` but is used as if it were a list with a single element `[0]` when `arr[i]` is negative.
     - The `segments_variants` list is appended with `max_segment + [i - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, which can lead to incorrect segments being added.
     - The `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]` if `len(total_max_segment) == 1`, which is redundant and incorrect because it should be the maximum segment found.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is based on the assumption that the maximum segment sum is used to maximize the array sum after `k` operations.
   - However, the `max_segment[0]` value returned by `func_2` is likely incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the issues in the `func_2` function, which does not correctly find the maximum segment sum. This leads to incorrect final calculations and outputs.

**Correctness: False**
