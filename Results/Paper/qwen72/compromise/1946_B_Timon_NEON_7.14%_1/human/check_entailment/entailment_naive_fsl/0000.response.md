Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incomplete Function 3**: The function `func_3` is defined but does not contain any logic to perform the operations described in the problem. It only initializes `answer` to 0 and does not proceed further.

2. **Incorrect Logic in Function 2**: The function `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not correctly handle the logic for multiple segments or the insertion of the sum back into the array. It also does not consider the case where the entire array is negative or the case where the array is empty.

3. **Missing Main Logic**: The program does not have a main function or any logic to handle multiple test cases as described in the problem. It does not read the input, process each test case, and output the results.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the modulo operation, but it is not used in the context of the problem to ensure the final answer is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
