Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in `a`.
   - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` to track the current and maximum segments.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on the current element being positive or negative.
   - After the loop, it appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` with the last index of the array.
   - It then finds the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants` and returns it.
   - However, the function has a logical issue: it appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if `new_segment` is an empty list, which can lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where all elements are negative correctly, as it always appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` regardless of their values.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - It uses the result from `func_2` to determine the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is negative, it is set to 0, which is correct because an empty subarray has a sum of 0.
   - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is used to calculate the final sum. This formula is based on the idea that the maximum segment can be inserted `k` times, and the rest of the array remains unchanged.
   - The result is then taken modulo `10^9 + 7` using `func_1`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly computes the modulo `10^9 + 7` of the input number.
   - This is necessary to handle large numbers and ensure the output is within the required range.

5. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3` is not used in the main logic and always returns 0. This function is redundant and can be ignored.

Given the issues in `func_2`, the program is not correct. Specifically, the function does not handle the case where all elements are negative correctly, and it appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even when they are not valid segments.

Correctness: **False**
