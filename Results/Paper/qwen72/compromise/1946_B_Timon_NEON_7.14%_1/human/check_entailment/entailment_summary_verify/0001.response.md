### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(number)`:**
     - This function returns the result of `number % 1000000007`, which is used to ensure the final sum is within the required modulo.
     - This function is correct for the purpose of applying the modulo operation.

   - **`func_2(arr)`:**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, the function has several issues:
       - It initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` as lists with a single element, which is not a common practice for tracking subarray sums and indices.
       - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. For example, it does not correctly handle the case where a new segment starts with a negative number.
       - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which can lead to incorrect results.
       - The function does not handle the case where the entire array is negative correctly.
     - Given these issues, `func_2` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem.

   - **`func_3(number, quantity)`:**
     - This function is intended to compute the final answer, but it is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.
     - The function initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else, which is clearly incorrect.
     - The function summary confirms that `func_3` always returns 0, which is not the correct behavior for the problem.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it fails to do so due to the issues mentioned.
   - The function `func_3` is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` has logical errors, and `func_3` is incomplete.

Final: **False**
