Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is a list containing the sum of the maximum positive segment and the index of the last element in that segment; `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a positive segment and the indices of the first and last elements in that segment, with an additional list appended that contains the elements of `max_segment` plus the value `len(arr) - 1`; `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list contains the elements of `max_segment` plus the value `len(arr) - 1`. The other variables (`new_segment` and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
