You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function prints 'NO' if `n` is odd or if the length of the generated string exceeds 200 characters. If `n` is even and the length of the string is within the limit, it prints 'YES' followed by the string, which consists of the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each case.

2. **Odd `n` Check**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because each special character must form a pair with its neighbor, and an odd number of such pairs is not possible.

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other 'A' in the 'AAB' pattern). The 'B' in the pattern is not a special character because it is not equal to either of its neighbors.

4. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. This is correct because the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is a solution of length at most 200. The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 150 for `1 <= n <= 50`.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO'. It also ensures that the constructed string is within the length limit of 200.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
