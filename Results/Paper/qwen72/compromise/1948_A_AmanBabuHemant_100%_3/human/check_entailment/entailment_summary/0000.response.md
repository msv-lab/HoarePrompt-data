Reasoning:

1. **Odd `n` Handling**: The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters, as each special character must be part of a pair or a triplet to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Therefore, the program prints 'NO' for odd `n`, which is correct.

2. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other 'A' in the same 'AAB' segment). The length of the string generated by this pattern is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 150 for `n` in the range [1, 50]. Since 150 is well within the 200-character limit, the program correctly prints 'YES' followed by the string.

3. **Length Check**: The program includes a check to ensure that the length of the generated string does not exceed 200 characters. However, this check is unnecessary because the maximum length of the string for `n = 50` (the largest possible input) is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is always less than 200. Therefore, the length check will never trigger the 'NO' condition for valid inputs.

4. **Output Format**: The program follows the required output format: it prints 'NO' for invalid cases and 'YES' followed by the string for valid cases.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
