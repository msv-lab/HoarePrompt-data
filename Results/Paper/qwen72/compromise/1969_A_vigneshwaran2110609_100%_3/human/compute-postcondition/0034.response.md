Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then `l[0]` is 1, `l[1]` is 1, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.***
