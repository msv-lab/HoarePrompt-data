Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is `x`, `x` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `p`, `i`, `x`, and `flag` are not directly affected by this code, so their values remain unchanged.
- The variable `l` is now a list of integers provided by the user, replacing its previous value.
- The condition for `flag` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify `flag` or any of the variables it depends on (`i` and `l`).
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `l` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
