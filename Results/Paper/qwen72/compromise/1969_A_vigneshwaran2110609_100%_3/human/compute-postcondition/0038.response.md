Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
