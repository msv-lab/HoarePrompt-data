The `print(2)` statement will print the integer value 2. The precondition provides information about various variables and objects (`t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, `flag`, `i`), but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the integer 2.

Output: **2**
