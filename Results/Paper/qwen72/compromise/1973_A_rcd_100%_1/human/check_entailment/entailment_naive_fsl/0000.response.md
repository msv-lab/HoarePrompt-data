Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to correctly compute the maximum number of draws in some cases. Specifically, the logic inside the `while` loop does not always find the correct number of draws. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

Actual Output:
```
8
```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of draws. The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of points and then determine the maximum number of draws based on the constraints and the distribution of points. The program's current logic does not handle this correctly in all cases.
