Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with each element `a_i` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5. No changes have been made to any variables.**
