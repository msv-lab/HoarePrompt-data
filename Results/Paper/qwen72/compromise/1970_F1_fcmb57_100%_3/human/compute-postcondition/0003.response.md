The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. The function is intended to return the updated coordinates `x + dx` and `y + dy`, but it results in an error because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, the return statement cannot be executed.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99. It is intended to return updated coordinates, but it results in an error due to incorrect unpacking of `b`.**
