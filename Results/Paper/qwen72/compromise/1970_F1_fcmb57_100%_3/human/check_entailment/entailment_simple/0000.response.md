Reasoning:  
The provided program has a fundamental issue in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to take the current position of an entity (a player or the Quaffle) and a movement direction, and then return the new position after the movement. However, the `mouvements` dictionary contains tuples representing the direction of movement (e.g., `(-1, 0)` for 'L'), but the function `func_1` is called with the direction as a single character (e.g., `'L'`). This causes an error because the function tries to unpack `b` (which is a single character) into `dx` and `dy`, but `b` should be a tuple.

Additionally, the program does not handle the movement of the Quaffle when it is not being carried by a player. It also does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, which is a requirement according to the problem description.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
