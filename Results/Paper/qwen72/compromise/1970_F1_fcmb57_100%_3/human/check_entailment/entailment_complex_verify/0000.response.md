### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Field Setup:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field, the players, and the goals.
   - It reads the field and populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries accordingly.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles player movements using the `func_1` function, which updates the player's position based on the given direction.

3. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The program checks if a player is at a goal and increments the score for the corresponding team.
   - However, it does not account for the scenario where a player scores in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should get a point, and vice versa.

4. **Function `func_1` Error:**
   - The annotated code correctly identifies a potential error in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to handle the movement of players, but it incorrectly unpacks the `b` parameter, which is a tuple of movement directions, not an integer.

5. **Correcting the Function `func_1`:**
   - The function should correctly unpack the tuple `b` into `dx` and `dy` and then update the player's position.
   - The correct implementation of `func_1` should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(a, b):
         x, y = a
         dx, dy = b
         return (x + dx, y + dy)
     ```

6. **Correcting the Scoring Logic:**
   - The program needs to check if the player is at a goal and then determine if the goal is the correct one for scoring a point.
   - The corrected scoring logic should be:
     ```python
     for i in range(moves):
         mo = input().split()
         if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
             players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
         elif mo[1] == 'T':
             if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
                 if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                     pointsb += 1
                     print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                 else:
                     pointsb += 1
                     print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
             elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
                 if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                     pointsr += 1
                     print(i, 'RED GOAL')
                 else:
                     pointsr += 1
                     print(i, 'RED GOAL')
     ```

7. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness: False.**
- **Explanation:**
  - The program does not handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal correctly. It incorrectly awards points to the team of the player instead of the opposing team.

### Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly identifies the error in the `func_1` function and explains that it will result in a runtime error because `b` is a tuple and cannot be unpacked as an integer.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **accurate**. The program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in the wrong goal correctly, and it also contains a runtime error in the `func_1` function.
- The program needs to be corrected to handle the wrong goal scoring scenario and fix the `func_1` function.

### Final: **False**
