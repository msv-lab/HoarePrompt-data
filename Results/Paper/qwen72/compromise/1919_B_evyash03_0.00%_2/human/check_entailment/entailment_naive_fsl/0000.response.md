Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the splitting of the array into subarrays optimally to minimize the penalty. The program incorrectly splits the string based on the presence of '-' characters and then calculates the penalty, which does not align with the problem's requirement to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
The expected output is `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` or `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, both of which result in a total penalty of `0`.

However, the provided program will output `3`:
- The program splits the string into `['', '+', '+', '+', '+', '']` and then calculates the penalty based on the balance of '+' and '-' characters.
- This results in an incorrect penalty calculation.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
