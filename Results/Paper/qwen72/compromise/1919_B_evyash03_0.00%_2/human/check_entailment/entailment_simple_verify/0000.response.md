### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The program uses `expression.split('-')` to split the string `expression` into parts. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The `split('-')` method splits the string at every '-' character, which can result in empty strings and does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the penalty based on the balance of '+' and '-' characters, but it does not correctly handle the splitting of the array into subarrays.
   - The program increments `count` every time the balance goes below zero and resets the balance to zero. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The final return value `count + (balance > 0)` is also incorrect because it does not account for the actual penalty calculation as described in the problem.

### Counterexample Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
- The expected output is `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` or `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, both of which result in a total penalty of `0`.
- However, the provided program will output `3`:
  - The program splits the string into `['', '+', '+', '+', '+', '']`.
  - For each part, it calculates the balance:
    - `''` (balance = 0, count = 0)
    - `+` (balance = 1, count = 0)
    - `+` (balance = 2, count = 0)
    - `+` (balance = 3, count = 0)
    - `+` (balance = 4, count = 0)
    - `''` (balance = 4, count = 0)
  - The balance never goes below zero, so `count` remains 0.
  - The final balance is 4, so the program returns `0 + (4 > 0) = 1`.

This clearly shows that the program's logic for splitting and calculating the penalty is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find a way to split the array `a` such that the total penalty is minimized. The optimal way to do this is to split the array at every point where the sum of the subarray is zero. This ensures that the penalty for each subarray is zero, and the total penalty is minimized.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem.

Final: **False**
