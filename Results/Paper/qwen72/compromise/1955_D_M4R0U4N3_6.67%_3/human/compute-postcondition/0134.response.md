Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `done`, `ans` is increased by 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `old` is removed from `done`, and `a[r]` remains in `todo` if it was already in `todo`, otherwise it remains in `extra`. If `old` is not in `done`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.***
