Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `extra` is a set with `a[1]` removed or unchanged based on the conditions, `done` contains `a[r]` or is unchanged based on the conditions, `ans` is increased by 1.**
