To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `r`, `m`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `m` is less than `n`, and `r` starts at `m`.

Given the initial state:
- _ is 1 (this variable is not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `todo` is a set of integers from the new input that were not in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]`
- `done` is a set of integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were initially in `todo`
- `extra` is a set of integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not initially in `todo`
- `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k` else `ans` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure that `r` starts at `m` and that `m` is less than `n` for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `m`, `m` must be less than `n`**
