The code `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `done`. The value of `old` is `a[1]`, which is an integer from the list `a`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `extra` is a set, `ans` is 2 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `done` is the set `done` with the element `a[1]` removed.**
