Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` is an empty set, `extra` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `extra` during the loop execution but were not added to `done`.**

Explanation:
- The code `done = set()` reinitializes the `done` set to an empty set.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `old`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged.
- The `done` set, which previously contained integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added during the loop execution, is now empty.
