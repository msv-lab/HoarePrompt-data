Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` depending on the condition. If `a[1]` is in `todo`, `todo` is updated to exclude `a[1]`, `done` is updated to include `a[1]`, and `extra` remains empty. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` remains empty, and `extra` is updated to include `a[1]`.***
