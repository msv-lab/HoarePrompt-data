To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `r`, `m`, and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `m + 1`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is `m + 1`.
- `old` is `a[1]`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed.
- If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
- `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` as described in the if part.

### Loop Statement:
```
for r in range(m, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `r`, `m`, and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `r` is less than `n`.
3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `r` is `m + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than `m + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `r` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `r` will be `m + 2`.
   - The condition `r < n` must still hold for the loop to execute again, so `n` must be greater than `m + 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `m + 2`.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is `m + 2`.
- `old` remains `a[1]`.
- `j` remains `m - 1`.
- `todo` remains a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed.
- `ans` remains unchanged unless `len(done) >= k` in the loop body.
- `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` as described in the if part.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `ans` remains unchanged unless `len(done) >= k` in the loop body, `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` as described in the if part.**
