Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `todo` is a set of integers from the new input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` depending on the condition, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is not in the set `todo`.**
