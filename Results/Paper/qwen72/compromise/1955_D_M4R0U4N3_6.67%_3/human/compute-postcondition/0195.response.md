The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element at index `r` from the list `a` from the set `todo`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step impact and the resulting output state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is greater than `m + 1`.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `r` is `m + 1`.
   - `old` is `a[1]`.
   - `j` is `m - 1`.
   - `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed.
   - If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` is a set with `a[1]` removed.
   - If `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is in `done`, `todo` also contains `a[1]` and `done` is the set `done` with the element `a[1]` removed.
   - `ans` is 2 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The element `a[r]` is removed from the set `todo`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `todo` is updated by removing the element `a[r]`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is greater than `m + 1`.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `r` is `m + 1`.
   - `old` is `a[1]`.
   - `j` is `m - 1`.
   - `todo` is the set `todo` with the element `a[r]` removed.
   - If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` is a set with `a[1]` removed.
   - If `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is in `done`, `todo` also contains `a[1]` and `done` is the set `done` with the element `a[1]` removed.
   - `ans` is 2 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is the set `todo` with the element `a[r]` removed, if `old` is in `extra` then `extra` is a set with `a[1]` removed, if `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is in `done` then `todo` also contains `a[1]` and `done` is the set `done` with the element `a[1]` removed, `ans` is 2 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
