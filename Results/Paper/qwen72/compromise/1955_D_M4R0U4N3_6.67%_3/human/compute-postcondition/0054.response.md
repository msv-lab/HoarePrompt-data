Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `n` must be greater than `r + 1`, `ans` is 0 or 2 depending on the number of elements in `done`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`, `done` now contains `a[r]`, and the state of `extra` remains unchanged based on the presence of `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) in these sets. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` now contains the value `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `old` is added back to `todo`, and `done` is updated accordingly. The state of `todo` and `extra` is adjusted based on the presence of `old` in these sets, but the overall structure and relationships between the variables remain consistent with the precondition.**
