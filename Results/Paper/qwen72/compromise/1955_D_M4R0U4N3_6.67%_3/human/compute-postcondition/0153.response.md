Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[j]`, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[j]` is no longer in `todo`.**

Explanation:
- The value `a[j]` is added to the set `done`.
- The set `done` now contains the value `a[j]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
