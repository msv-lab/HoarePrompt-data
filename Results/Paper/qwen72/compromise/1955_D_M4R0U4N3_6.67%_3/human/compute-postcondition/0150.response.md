The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `j` should be set to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
