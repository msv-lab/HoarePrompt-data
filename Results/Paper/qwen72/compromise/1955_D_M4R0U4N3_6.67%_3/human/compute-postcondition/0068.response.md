The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 initially. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `ans` will be 1. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `r + 1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `ans` is 1. If `a[r]` is in the set `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to the set `done`. If `old` is in the list `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in the set `done`, `old` is added to the set `todo` and removed from the set `done`. Otherwise, if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to the list `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed. If `old` was in `done`, it is added to `todo` and removed from `done`.**
