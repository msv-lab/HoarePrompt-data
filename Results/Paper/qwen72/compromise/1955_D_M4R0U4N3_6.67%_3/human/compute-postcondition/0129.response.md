The only objects in the loop head are the variables `r`, `m`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `r` and the range defined by `m` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m + 1`, and the loop will execute again if `r` is less than `n`.

At the start of the next iteration, `r` will be incremented by 1, so `r` will be `m + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`.

State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m - 1]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, it remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `old` is not in `done` but in `extra`, it remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `old` is in `done` but not in `extra`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.**
