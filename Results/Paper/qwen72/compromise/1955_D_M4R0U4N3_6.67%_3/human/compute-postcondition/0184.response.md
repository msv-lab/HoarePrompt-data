Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`, and `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`, and the following conditions apply: If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`, and `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, and `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `old` is not in `extra` or `done`, the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged, and `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.***
