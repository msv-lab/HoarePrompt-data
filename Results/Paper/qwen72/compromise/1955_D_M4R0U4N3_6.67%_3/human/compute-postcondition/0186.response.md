Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `done` is a set with the length greater than or equal to `k`, `extra` is a set, `ans` is 2.** 

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
