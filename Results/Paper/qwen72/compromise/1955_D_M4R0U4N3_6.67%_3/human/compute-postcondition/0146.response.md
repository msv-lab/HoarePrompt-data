Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were not in the initial `m` elements and were not added to `done` during the loop execution, `done` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `done` during the loop execution, `extra` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `extra` during the loop execution but were not added to `done`.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The initial state of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `old`, `ans`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`) remains unchanged. The list `a` now contains the integers provided by the user.
