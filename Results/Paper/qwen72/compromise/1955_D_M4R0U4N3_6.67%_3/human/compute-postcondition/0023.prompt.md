Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `a[0]` (which is `n`) is in `todo`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[0]` removed, and `done` is a set containing the value `a[0]`. If `a[0]` is not in `todo`, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]` which is `n`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `a[1]` (which is `m`) is in `todo`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[1]` removed, `done` is a set containing the values `a[0]` (which is `n`) and `a[1]` (which is `m`), and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]` which is `n`). If `a[1]` is not in `todo`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[0]` removed if `a[0]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing the value `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo` or an empty set otherwise, and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]` which is `n`) and the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]` which is `m`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2. If `a[1]` (which is `m`) is in `todo`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[2]` (which is `k`) removed, `done` is a set containing the values `a[0]` (which is `n`), `a[1]` (which is `m`), and `a[2]` (which is `k`), and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]` which is `n`) and the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]` which is `m`). If `a[1]` (which is `m`) is not in `todo`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[0]` (which is `n`) removed if `a[0]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing the value `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo` or an empty set otherwise, and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]` which is `n`), the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]` which is `m`), and the third element of `a` (i.e., `a[2]` which is `k`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
