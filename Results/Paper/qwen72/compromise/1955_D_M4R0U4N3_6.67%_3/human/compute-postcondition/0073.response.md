Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `todo` is a set of integers that were not in `a` and were not moved to `done`, `done` is a set containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and removed from it, plus any other elements from `a` that were in `todo` and moved to `done` during the loop, `extra` is a set containing any values from `a` that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`, plus any other elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and added to `extra` during the loop, `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` depending on the condition.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input provided.
- The list `a` is updated to contain the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- The values of `_`, `j`, `r`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.
