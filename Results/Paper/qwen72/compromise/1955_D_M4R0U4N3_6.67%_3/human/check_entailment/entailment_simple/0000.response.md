### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the array `a` and the array `b` and converts them into sets `todo` and `done` for efficient element checking and removal.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The function initializes the sets `done` and `extra` to keep track of elements that match and do not match the elements in `b`, respectively.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` based on whether the element is in `todo` or not.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1 if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, otherwise 0.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window, it updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` by removing the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[r - m]`) and adding the new element (`a[r]`).
   - It increments `ans` if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all subsegments, the function prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly initializes the sets and the initial count of good subsegments.
- The sliding window approach is used efficiently to update the sets and count the number of good subsegments.
- The conditions for updating the sets and checking the number of elements in `done` are correct and match the problem requirements.
