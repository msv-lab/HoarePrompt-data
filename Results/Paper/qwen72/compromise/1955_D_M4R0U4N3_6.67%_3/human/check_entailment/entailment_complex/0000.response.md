Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `todo` is initialized as a set containing the elements of `b`. This represents the elements that need to be matched in the subarray.
   - `done` is initialized as an empty set. This will store the elements from `b` that are found in the current subarray.
   - `extra` is initialized as an empty set. This will store the elements in the current subarray that are not in `b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check**:
   - The function iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if they are in `todo`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.

4. **Counting Good Subarrays**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to 1 if the initial subarray is good (i.e., `len(done) >= k`), otherwise 0.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` (from `m` to `n-1`), updating the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to reflect the sliding window of size `m`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - The element `a[r - m]` is removed from the window.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
     - The new element `a[r]` is checked:
       - If it is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
       - If it is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - The function increments `ans` if the current subarray is good (i.e., `len(done) >= k`).

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a test case, the function prints the count `ans`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `k` is 1 correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is equal to `m` correctly.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` ensures that the operations (add, remove, check membership) are efficient (O(1) on average).

8. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of good subarrays by maintaining the sliding window and updating the sets accordingly.
   - The logic for adding and removing elements from the sets is correct, ensuring that the count of matching elements is accurately maintained.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
