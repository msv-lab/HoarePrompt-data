The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Let's break down the calculation:

- `n` is 4
- `b` is 4
- `ans` is 5

First, calculate `(n + b) // (b * b)`:
- `(n + b)` is `4 + 4` which equals 8
- `(b * b)` is `4 * 4` which equals 16
- `(n + b) // (b * b)` is `8 // 16` which equals 0 (since integer division truncates the decimal part)

Then, update `ans`:
- `ans` is initially 5
- Adding 0 to `ans` results in `ans` remaining 5

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is 4, `m` is 6, `b` is 4, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is 5**
