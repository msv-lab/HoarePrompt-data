Output State: **`n` is 4, `m` is 6, `b` is 5, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is 6.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m` (which is 4 in this case).
- During each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated using the formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
- After the first iteration (`b = 2`), `ans` becomes 5.
- After the second iteration (`b = 3`), `ans` remains 5 because `(4 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 7 // 9 = 0`.
- After the third iteration (`b = 4`), `ans` becomes 6 because `(4 + 4) // (4 * 4) = 8 // 16 = 0`, but the previous value of `ans` was 5, so it increments by 1.
- The loop then terminates as `b` reaches 5, which is outside the range of the loop.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop is `n` is 4, `m` is 6, `b` is 5, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, and `ans` is 6.
