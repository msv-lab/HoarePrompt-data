The only variables in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b` relative to `min(n, m)`. If `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 3, and `min(n, m)` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `min(n, m)` must still be at least 4 for the loop condition to hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers derived from the input string such that `min(n, m)` must be at least 4, `b` is 4, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`**
