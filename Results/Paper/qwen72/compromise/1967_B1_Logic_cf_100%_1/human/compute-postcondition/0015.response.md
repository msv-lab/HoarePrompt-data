The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial state to the values provided by the input.

Let's assume the input is "4 6" for the purpose of this example.

- `n` and `m` are now strings "4" and "6" respectively.
- `b` was initially defined as `min(n, m) + 1`. Since `n` and `m` are now strings, this definition is no longer valid unless they are converted back to integers.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `T` remains 1.
- `ans` was initially defined based on the integer values of `n` and `m`. Since `n` and `m` are now strings, the calculation for `ans` is no longer valid unless they are converted back to integers.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is "4", `m` is "6", `b` is undefined due to `n` and `m` being strings, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is undefined due to `n` and `m` being strings.**
