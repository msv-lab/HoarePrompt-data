Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings s where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to include the parameters as described in the problem. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, strings):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and strings is a list of t strings, where each string s consists of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 10^6.**
