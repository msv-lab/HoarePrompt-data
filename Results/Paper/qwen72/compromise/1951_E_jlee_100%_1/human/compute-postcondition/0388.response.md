Output State: **`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, `done` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. `count2` is 0.**
