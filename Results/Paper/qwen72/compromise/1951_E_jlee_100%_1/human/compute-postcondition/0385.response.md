Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` and `count2` remain unchanged.
- `done` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `j`**: According to the initial state, `j` is 1.
2. **Value of `string[:j - 1]`**:
   - `j - 1` is `1 - 1`, which is 0.
   - `string[:0]` is an empty string because it includes all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index 0.
3. **Value of `string[j - 1:]`**:
   - `j - 1` is 0.
   - `string[0:]` is the entire string `string` because it includes all characters from index 0 to the end of the string.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Output: **'' [string] (where [string] is the entire string `string`)**
