The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about the variable `n`, which is the length of the `string` and is greater than 0, and the variable `j`, which is 0. Additionally, it states that the first character of `string` is not equal to the last character of `string`.

However, none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
