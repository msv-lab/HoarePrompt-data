Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the length of `string`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i + 1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `done` is `False`, `x` is the first character of `string`. If `s.count(x)` is equal to `n`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`, the program also skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements in the loop.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, and the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, unless `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, in which case `count2` is set to 0, `done` remains unchanged, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. If the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1 and `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is 0, and the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged. If `count > 0`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `s[j] == x`, `done` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. Otherwise, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count <= 0`, `done` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is 0 or less and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 0 or less and `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `count` is incremented by 1 and `done` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
