Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `count2` is 0.
- `done` remains False.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.
- The current value of `count2` is greater than `count`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
