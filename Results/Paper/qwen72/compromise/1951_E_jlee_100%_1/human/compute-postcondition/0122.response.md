Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 2, `j` is 2, `count2` is 2, `done` remains False. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
