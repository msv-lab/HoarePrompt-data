Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - The first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x`.
   - `count2` is greater than `count`, and `count2` is not equal to `count`.
   - If `count` is less than 1, `done` is set to True; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j], string[j:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `string[:j]` will slice the string from the start up to, but not including, the index `j`. Since `j` is 0, `string[:j]` will be an empty string.
   - `string[j:]` will slice the string from the index `j` to the end. Since `j` is 0, `string[j:]` will be the entire string `string`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **'' [string] (where [string] is the entire string `string`)**
