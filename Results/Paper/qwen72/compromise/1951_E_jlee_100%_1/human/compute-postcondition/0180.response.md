Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to the element at the position `n-1` in `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`).

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
