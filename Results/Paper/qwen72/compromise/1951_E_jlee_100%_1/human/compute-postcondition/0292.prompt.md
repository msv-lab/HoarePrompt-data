Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is updated based on its comparison with `count`: if `count2` is less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `count2` remains equal to `count` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0, and the current iteration is skipped; if `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `count` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, or if `count` is greater than or equal to 1, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, and `count2` is either unchanged or increased by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, `count2` is increased by 1 and `done` remains unchanged. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0 and `done` remains unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
