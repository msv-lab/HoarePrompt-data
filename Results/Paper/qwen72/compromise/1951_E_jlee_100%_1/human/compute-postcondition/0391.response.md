To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` and `count2` remain unchanged.
- `done` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

### Analysis:
1. **String Length and Indexing**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`, so `n - 1` is the last index of the string.
   - `j` is 1, so `s[j]` is the second character of the string, and `s[n - 1 - j]` is the second-to-last character of the string.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The code checks if `s[j]` (the second character) is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (the second-to-last character).
   - If they are equal, `done` remains unchanged.
   - If they are not equal, `done` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken.

3. **Additional Condition**:
   - If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1, and the current iteration is skipped.
   - However, this condition does not affect the `print('YES')` statement directly.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('YES')` statement is not dependent on any of the conditions described in the initial state. It will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
