Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is updated based on its comparison with `count`: if `count2` is less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `count2` remains equal to `count` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0, and the current iteration is skipped; if `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.***
