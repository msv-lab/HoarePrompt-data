Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count2` is 1 (if `s[j]` is equal to `x`), `done` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `done` to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
