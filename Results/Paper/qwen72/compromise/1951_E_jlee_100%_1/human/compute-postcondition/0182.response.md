The provided code snippet is:
```
print(string)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to the element at the position `n-1` in `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`).

However, the variable `string` is not defined in the initial state or in the code snippet provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `string` based on the given information.

Output: **string (where string is an undefined variable and its value is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet)**
