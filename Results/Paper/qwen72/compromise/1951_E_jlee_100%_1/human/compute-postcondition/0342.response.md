Postcondition: **`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x`. `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. If `count` is less than 1, `done` is set to True; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.**
