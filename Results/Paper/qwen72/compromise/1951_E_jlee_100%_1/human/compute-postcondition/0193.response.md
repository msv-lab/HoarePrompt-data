Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.
   - `count2` is less than `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `j`, `count`, `s[j]`, `done`, and `count2`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the print statement is `YES`.

Output: **YES**
