You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        print(num)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and writes the output to stdout. Each test case includes constraints of three types (1, 2, and 3) with associated values. The function identifies the first integer within the range from the maximum value of type 1 constraints to the minimum value of type 2 constraints that is not present in the type 3 constraints. If such an integer is found, it is printed; otherwise, 0 is printed. The function completes all test cases, and the final state is that all input has been processed and the corresponding outputs have been written to stdout.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints. It only finds the first valid integer `k` and prints it, instead of counting all valid integers. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

The program should count all integers from 3 to 10 (inclusive) that are not equal to 1 or 5, which are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. However, it only finds the first valid integer (3) and prints it, instead of counting all valid integers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
