Output State: **`iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` and `a` are input integers. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing `a`.**

The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the input integers provided. The conditions for `iterable`, `loop`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are populated based on the new value of `x` as described in the initial state.
