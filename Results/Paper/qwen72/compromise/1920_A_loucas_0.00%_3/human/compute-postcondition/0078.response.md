Postcondition: ***`iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` and `a` are input integers. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a` and `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `a` three times, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` is a list containing `a`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing `a` and `a` is appended to `no`.***
