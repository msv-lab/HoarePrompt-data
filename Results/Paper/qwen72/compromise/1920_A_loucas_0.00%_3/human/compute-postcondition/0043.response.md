Output State: **`big` must contain at least one element, `less` must contain at least one element, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 2`, `i` must be less than `min(less)`, `num` is `max(big) + 2`**

The value of `num` is now equal to `i`, which is `max(big) + 2`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
