Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
