Output State: **`x` and `a` are input integers, `less` is an empty list or contains `[a]` if `x` is 2, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer that must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, `no` is an empty list if `x` is 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is a list containing the input integer `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `big.append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `big`.
- If `x` is 1, `big` initially contains `[a]`, so after the append, `big` will contain `[a, a]`.
- If `x` is 2, `big` initially is an empty list, so after the append, `big` will contain `[a]`.
- If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `big` initially is an empty list, so after the append, `big` will contain `[a]`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
