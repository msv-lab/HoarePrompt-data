Output State: **`loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2.** 

The value of `a` has been appended to the list `no`, so `no` is no longer an empty list but contains the value of `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
