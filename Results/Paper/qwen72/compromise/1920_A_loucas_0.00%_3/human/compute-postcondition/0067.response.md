Output State: **`iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` and `a` are input integers. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a` and `a`. `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `big`.
- If `x` is 1, `big` was initially a list containing `a`, so after the code, `big` will be a list containing `a` and `a` (i.e., `[a, a]`).
- If `x` is 2, `less` was initially a list containing `a`, and `big` was an empty list, so after the code, `big` will be a list containing `a` (i.e., `[a]`), and `less` will remain `[a]`.
- If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` was initially a list containing `a`, and `big` and `less` were empty lists, so after the code, `big` will be a list containing `a` (i.e., `[a]`), and `less` and `no` will remain empty and `[a]` respectively.
- The values of `iterable`, `loop`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged.
