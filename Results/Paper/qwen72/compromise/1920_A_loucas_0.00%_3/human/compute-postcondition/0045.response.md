Postcondition: ***`big` must contain at least one element, `less` must contain at least one element, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 2`, and `i` must be less than `min(less)`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to `max(big) + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
