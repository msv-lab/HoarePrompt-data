Postcondition: ***`big` must contain at least one element, `less` must contain at least one element, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
