Output State: **The program returns -1.** 

In the initial state, `n` is 0, and `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` (excluding leading zeros). Since 0 in binary is `0`, it has 1 bit. Therefore, `position` is 1. The code returns `position - 1`, which is 1 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1.
