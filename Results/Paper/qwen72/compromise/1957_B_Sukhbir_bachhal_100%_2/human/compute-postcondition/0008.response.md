Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50000, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 1**

The value of `n` is right-shifted by 1, which means `n` is divided by 2 and the result is truncated to an integer. Since `n` was initially a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, after the right shift, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 50,000. The value of `position` remains unchanged.
