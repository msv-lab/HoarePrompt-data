### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the item prices for Alice (`a`) and Bob (`b`) using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The item prices for Alice are negated (`a = [-x for x in a]`). This is done to use a min-heap (which is what `heapq` provides) to simulate a max-heap for Alice's prices.
   - The items are stored in a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple contains the negated price for Alice and the price for Bob.
   - The list `arr` is sorted by Bob's prices in ascending order. This is a crucial step because Bob will take the items with the lowest `b_i` values for free.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a min-heap `k_arr` with the `k` items that have the highest Bob prices (since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, these are the last `k` items).
   - The sum of Bob's prices for these `k` items is subtracted from `sub_sum`.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the remaining items in `arr` and calculates the profit by considering the items that Alice can sell to Bob.
   - It uses a heap to keep track of the `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - For each item, it updates the `sub_sum` by subtracting Bob's price and adding Alice's price if the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices is non-negative.
   - It also updates the `sub_sum` by removing the item with the lowest Bob price from the heap and adding the current item to the heap.
   - The maximum profit is tracked and updated accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The maximum profit for each test case is printed.

### Issues:
- **Negation of Alice's Prices:**
  - The negation of Alice's prices (`a = [-x for x in a]`) is not necessary and can lead to confusion. Instead, the program should directly use the prices and handle them appropriately.
- **Heap Management:**
  - The use of `heapq.heappushpop` is correct, but the logic for updating `sub_sum` and `max_value` is a bit convoluted. Specifically, the condition `if k_range != 0` is not necessary and can be removed.
- **Function Naming:**
  - The function names `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are not descriptive and can make the code harder to understand. More meaningful names would be beneficial.

### Correctness:
Despite the issues mentioned, the core logic of the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description. The negation of Alice's prices and the heap management are not inherently incorrect but could be simplified for clarity.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True**

However, the program can be improved for better readability and maintainability.
