The only objects in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `main_ar` list. If `main_ar` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `val_b` was the first element in `main_ar`, and `main_ar` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `main_ar` must have at least two elements, and `val_b` will be the second element in `main_ar`.

State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of the first tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` must have at least two elements, with `val_b` being the second element in `main_ar`.**
