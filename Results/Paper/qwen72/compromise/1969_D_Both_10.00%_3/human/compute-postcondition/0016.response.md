Output State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of the first tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0, plus the sum of the first and second elements of the second tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0, plus the sum of the first and second elements of the third tuple in `main_ar`. `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` must have at least three elements, with `val_b` being the third element in `main_ar`.**
