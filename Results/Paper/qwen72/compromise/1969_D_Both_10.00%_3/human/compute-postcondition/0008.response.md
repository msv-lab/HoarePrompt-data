The only objects in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `main_ar`. If `main_ar` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `sub_summ`, `sec_arr`, and `val_a` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `main_ar` must have at least one element, and `val_b` will be the first element in `main_ar` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` remains unchanged, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must have at least one element, `val_b` is the first element in `main_ar`**
