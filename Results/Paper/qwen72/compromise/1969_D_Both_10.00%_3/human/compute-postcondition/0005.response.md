The only objects in the loop head are `val_a` and `sec_arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least three tuples, the loop will execute again for the third tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `sec_arr` has at least two tuples, and `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least three tuples, and `val_a` will be the third tuple in `sec_arr`.

State: **`sub_summ` is equal to `2 * val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `val_a` is the third tuple in `sec_arr`**
