Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least one test case.
   - `case` is the first test case in the list `test_cases`.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a list with at least one element.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `num` is the first element of `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `num` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Let's assume the first element of `a` is `num = 10`.
   - Let's assume `x = 3` and `y = 4`.
   - `mod_x` would be `10 % 3 = 1`.
   - `mod_y` would be `10 % 4 = 2`.
   - `required_mod_x` would be `(3 - 1) % 3 = 2 % 3 = 2`.
   - `required_mod_y` would be `2`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` as calculated above.

Output: **Number: 10, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 2, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 2**

Note: The actual values of `num`, `x`, and `y` depend on the specific test case provided in `test_cases`. The example values used here are for illustration purposes. If you provide the actual values, the output can be precisely determined.
