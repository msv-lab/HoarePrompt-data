Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary.
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases.
   - `case` is the second test case in the list `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`.
   - `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is now equal to `case['array']`.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `n` is the first element of the `params` list in the second test case (`case`).
   - `x` is the second element of the `params` list in the second test case (`case`).
   - `y` is the third element of the `params` list in the second test case (`case`).
   - `a` is the `array` associated with the second test case (`case`).

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` depend on the specific content of the second test case in the `test_cases` list, we can describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n] is the first element of the params list in the second test case, [x] is the second element of the params list in the second test case, [y] is the third element of the params list in the second test case, and [a] is the array associated with the second test case)**
