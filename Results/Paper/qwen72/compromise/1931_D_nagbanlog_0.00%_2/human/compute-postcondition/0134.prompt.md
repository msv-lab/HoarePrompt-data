Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, x, and y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), where n is the size of the array and x and y are Polycarp's favorite integers; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), which are the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = {}
    beautiful_count = 0
    print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        print(
            f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
            )
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list with `n` elements, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the loop, where `mod_x` is the remainder when each element of `a` is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder when each element of `a` is divided by `y`. `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `freq` will contain keys `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each unique combination of `mod_x` and `mod_y` encountered in the list `a`, with their corresponding values representing the count of occurrences of each combination. The variable `beautiful_count` will be incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for each `num` in `a` where `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`. The list `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` appended to it. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged as they were before the loop started.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `freq` contains the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a`. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`. The `results` list now includes the `beautiful_count` as its last element. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `case`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
