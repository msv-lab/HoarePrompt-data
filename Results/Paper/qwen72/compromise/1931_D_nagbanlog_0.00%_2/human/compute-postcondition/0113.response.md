Output State: **`mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`; `freq` is updated such that the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1; `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in `freq`; `results` remains unchanged; `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`; `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is a non-empty list; `num` is the second element of `a`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not initially in `freq`, it is now a key with a value of `1`.** 

The code snippet `required_mod_y = mod_y` does not change any of the existing conditions or values in the initial state. It simply assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`, which was already defined as `mod_y` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
