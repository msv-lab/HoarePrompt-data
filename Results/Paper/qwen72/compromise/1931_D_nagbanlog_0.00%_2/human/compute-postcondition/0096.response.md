To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty list.

### Given State:
- `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `results` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`.
- `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`.
- `a` is updated to the value of `case['array']`.
- `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be a non-empty list.
- The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in `a` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `results` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`, `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element of `a`, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.**
