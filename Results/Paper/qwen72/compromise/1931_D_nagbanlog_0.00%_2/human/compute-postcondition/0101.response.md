Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `results` remains unchanged.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`.
   - `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `num` is the first element of `a`.
   - `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `num`: This is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `mod_x`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. It represents the additional amount needed to make `num` divisible by `x`.
   - `required_mod_y`: This is simply `mod_y`.

4. **Final Output:**
   Since the exact values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the first element of the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**
