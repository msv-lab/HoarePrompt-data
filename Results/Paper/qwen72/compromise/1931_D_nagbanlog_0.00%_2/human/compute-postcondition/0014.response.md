Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is the value of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.** 

Explanation: The value of `beautiful_count` is updated by adding the value of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` to it. Since `freq` is initially an empty dictionary, the value of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` is 0, so `beautiful_count` remains 0 unless the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq` and has a non-zero value. All other variables remain unchanged.
