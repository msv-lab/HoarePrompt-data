Based on the initial state provided:

- `freq` contains the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a`.
- `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`.
- `results`, `t`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `case` are updated to the values of the next case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the array associated with the current `case`.
- `num` is the last element processed from `a`.
- `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are the final values computed for the last element of `a`.

The `print` statement will output the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the total count of beautiful pairs in the array `a`.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`)**
