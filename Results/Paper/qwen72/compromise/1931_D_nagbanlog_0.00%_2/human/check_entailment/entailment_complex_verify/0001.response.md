### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It iterates through the array and for each element \(a_i\):
     - Computes \(a_i \mod x\) and \(a_i \mod y\).
     - Determines the required remainders for a pair \((a_i, a_j)\) to satisfy the conditions:
       - \(a_j \mod x\) should be \((x - a_i \mod x) \mod x\).
       - \(a_j \mod y\) should be \(a_i \mod y\).
     - Checks if the required remainders are already in the frequency dictionary and increments the count of beautiful pairs accordingly.
     - Updates the frequency dictionary with the current remainders.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the required remainders for a pair to be beautiful.
   - The use of a frequency dictionary ensures efficient counting of pairs.
   - The conditions for divisibility by \(x\) and \(y\) are correctly checked.
   - The function processes each test case independently and appends the result to the `results` list.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the constraints specified in the problem statement, including large values of \(n\) and multiple test cases.
   - It correctly handles cases where no beautiful pairs exist.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and maintains the necessary state.
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to efficiently count the pairs.
   - The conditions for checking the required remainders are implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **True**
