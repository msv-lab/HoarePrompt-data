The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The parameters represent the length of the strings to be formed and the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to be used, respectively. The function returns a string that is formed by repeating the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' `n` times.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and returns a string formed by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.**
