### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Base Case:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_2` does not handle the base case where the array is already all zeros. However, this is not a critical issue in the context of the problem because the problem specifies that the operation can be applied any number of times, including zero times. Therefore, if the array is already all zeros, the function should still return "YES".

2. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying that the operation logic in `func_2` is flawed. The while loop in `func_2` is supposed to decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. However, the current implementation incorrectly uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which is not aligned with the problem description. The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
   - This incorrect logic can lead to elements being decremented by more than the required amount, causing the program to incorrectly print 'no' and return.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` checks if all elements are zero, but it is called after the operation logic in `func_2` has already potentially modified the array incorrectly. This leads to incorrect results.

4. **Necessary and Sufficient Condition:**
   - The original assessment suggests that the sum of elements at even indices should be equal to the sum of elements at odd indices, which is indeed a necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be transformable to all zeros. This is because each operation affects three consecutive elements, and the sum of the array elements remains constant modulo 3. If the sum of even-indexed elements is equal to the sum of odd-indexed elements, it is possible to balance the array to all zeros.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. The program's operation logic is incorrect, and it does not correctly handle the transformation of the array to all zeros. The suggested corrected approach is also correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
