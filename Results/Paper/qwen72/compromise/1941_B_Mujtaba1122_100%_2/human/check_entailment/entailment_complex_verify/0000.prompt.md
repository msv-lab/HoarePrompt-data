You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the list or n. The loop checks each element in the list from index 0 to n-1. If any element is not 0, the loop immediately returns False. If the loop completes all iterations without finding any non-zero elements, it does not return anything explicitly, so the function will return None.
    return True
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `list` and a non-negative integer `n` where `0 <= n <= len(list)`. It checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to index `n-1` are zero. If any element is non-zero, the function returns `False`. If all elements are zero or if `n` is 0, the function returns `True`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers with length n, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: The list will be modified such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) will be zero, and the first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) will remain unchanged. If the loop encounters a non-zero `list[i - 1]` after the inner loop, it will print 'no' and terminate.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list will be modified such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) will be zero, and the first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) will remain unchanged. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, it indicates that the condition inside `func_1` has been met. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, it indicates that the condition inside `func_1` has not been met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) are set to zero, while the first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) remain unchanged. If at any point during the modification process, an element at index \(i-1\) is found to be non-zero, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the list is successfully modified and `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES'. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, the function prints 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
no
NO
no
```

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Base Case:**
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the base case where the array is already all zeros. It should directly return "YES" in such cases.

2. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The operation logic in `func_2` is flawed. The while loop modifies the array elements in a way that does not align with the problem description. Specifically, the line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` and similar lines are incorrect. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements are zero, but it is called after the operation logic in `func_2` has already potentially modified the array incorrectly. This leads to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that the operations are applied in a way that respects the constraints and that the final array is checked for all zeros. A correct implementation would involve checking if the sum of the elements at even indices is equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices, as this is a necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be transformed to all zeros.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    even_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(0, n, 2))
    odd_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(1, n, 2))
    return even_sum == odd_sum

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version correctly checks if the sum of elements at even indices is equal to the sum of elements at odd indices, which is the key condition for the array to be transformable to all zeros.
