### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Base Case:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_2` does not handle the base case where the array is already all zeros. This is a valid issue because the function should return "YES" immediately if the array is already zero.

2. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the operation logic in `func_2` is flawed. The while loop in `func_2` modifies the array elements in a way that does not align with the problem description. Specifically, the line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` and similar lines are incorrect. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. However, the current implementation does not do this correctly. Instead, it subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` multiple times, which is not the intended operation.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` checks if all elements are zero, but it is called after the operation logic in `func_2` has already potentially modified the array incorrectly. This leads to incorrect results. The function `func_1` is a simple check, but it is used in the wrong context.

4. **Necessary and Sufficient Condition:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be transformable to all zeros: the sum of the elements at even indices should be equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices. This is a key insight that the original program does not utilize.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The issues identified in the assessment are valid and the proposed correct approach is sound. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
