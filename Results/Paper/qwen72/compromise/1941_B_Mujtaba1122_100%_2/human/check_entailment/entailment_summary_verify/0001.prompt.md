You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) are set to zero, while the first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) remain unchanged. If at any point during the modification process, an element at index \(i-1\) is found to be non-zero, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the list is successfully modified and `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES'. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, the function prints 'NO'.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We can perform an operation on any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) where we subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to make all elements zero by performing the operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - After performing the operations, it checks if the previous element `list[i-1]` is zero. If not, it prints "no" and returns.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Operation Application:**
     - The operation is applied incorrectly in `func_2`. The line:
       ```python
       list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
       list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
       list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
       ```
     - This subtracts `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`.
     - However, the correct operation should subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` without multiplying by `list[i-1]`.

   - **Incorrect Check for Zero:**
     - The check `if list[i - 1] != 0:` is performed after the loop, which is incorrect. The loop should ensure that the operation is applied only when all three elements are positive enough to perform the operation.
     - Additionally, the program should check the entire array for zero after all operations, not just the previous element.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should ensure that the operation is applied correctly and that the entire array is checked for zero after all operations.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_2(a, n)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **func_1** remains the same, checking if all elements are zero.
- **func_2** now correctly applies the operation and checks the entire array after all operations.
- The loop ensures that the operation is only applied when the conditions `list[i] >= 2`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met.
- After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints the appropriate result.
