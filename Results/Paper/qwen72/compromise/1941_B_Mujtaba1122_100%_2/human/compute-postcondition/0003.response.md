The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The precondition states that the function `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`, indicating that the condition inside `func_1` has been met. This means that the list has been modified such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) are zero, while the first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) remain unchanged.

Given that `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`, the `print` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
