Based on the initial state provided, the list is modified such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) are set to zero, while the first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) remain unchanged. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
