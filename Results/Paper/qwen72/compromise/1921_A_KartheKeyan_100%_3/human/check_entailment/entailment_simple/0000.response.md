Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given its corner coordinates. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, which is a good approach to ensure that the points are in a predictable order. However, sorting the points as tuples will sort them lexicographically (first by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate), which might not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to form the sides of the square.

2. **Calculating the Side Length**: The program calculates the side length of the square by finding the distance between two points. However, the way it calculates `p1` and `p2` is incorrect. The side length of the square should be the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points, not the Euclidean distance between them.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated by multiplying the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. This is incorrect because the area of a square is the side length squared, not the product of the square roots of the distances.

4. **Unnecessary Use of `math.sqrt`**: The program uses `math.sqrt` to calculate the side length and then multiplies the results. This is unnecessary and can introduce floating-point precision errors. Instead, the side length should be calculated directly, and the area should be the square of that side length.

5. **Incorrect Logic for Side Length**: The program assumes that the distance between `coord[1]` and `coord[0]` and the distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]` are the side lengths of the square. This is not necessarily true, as the points might not be in the correct order after sorting.

### Correct Approach:
- **Sort the Coordinates**: Sort the coordinates by x-coordinate first, and then by y-coordinate.
- **Extract the Side Length**: The side length of the square can be found by taking the difference between the x-coordinates of the first two points (or the y-coordinates of the last two points, since the sides are parallel to the axes).
- **Calculate the Area**: The area is the side length squared.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort the coordinates by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        # The side length of the square is the difference between the x-coordinates of the first two points
        side_length = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the coordinates ensures that the points are in a predictable order. The first two points will have the same y-coordinate but different x-coordinates, and the last two points will have the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates.
- **Side Length**: The side length is calculated as the difference between the x-coordinates of the first two points (or the y-coordinates of the last two points).
- **Area Calculation**: The area is the side length squared, which is the correct formula for the area of a square.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected code should work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
