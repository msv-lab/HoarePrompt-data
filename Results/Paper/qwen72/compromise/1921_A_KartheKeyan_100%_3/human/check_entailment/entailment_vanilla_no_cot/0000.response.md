Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, but this can cause issues because the corners of the square are not necessarily sorted in a way that makes it easy to compute the side length. Sorting the coordinates does not guarantee that the points will be in the correct order to form the sides of the square.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Side Length**: The program calculates the side length of the square using the distance between two points, but it does not correctly identify which points form the sides of the square. The calculation `p1` and `p2` are based on the assumption that the sorted coordinates will form the sides, which is not always true.

3. **Unnecessary Use of `math.sqrt`**: The area of the square can be calculated directly by squaring the side length. There is no need to take the square root and then multiply it by itself.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Identify the unique x and y coordinates from the four points.
- The difference between the maximum and minimum x coordinates (or y coordinates) will give you the side length of the square.
- The area of the square is the side length squared.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x_coords = []
        y_coords = []
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            x_coords.append(x)
            y_coords.append(y)
        
        side_length = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)  # or max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        t -= 1

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates and then calculates the area by squaring the side length.
