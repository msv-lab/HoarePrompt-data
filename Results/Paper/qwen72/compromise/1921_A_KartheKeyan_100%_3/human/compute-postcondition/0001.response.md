Output State: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates (x_i, y_i) satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case guarantees the existence of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The variable `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies the conditions for the test cases and the variable `n`.
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be an integer input provided by the user.
- The other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the conditions from the initial state, with the additional information that `n` is now an input integer.
