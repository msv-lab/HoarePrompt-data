Output State: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates (x_i, y_i) satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case guarantees the existence of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The variable `n` is an input integer, and the variable `n` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the while loop. The variable `s` is calculated and printed for each iteration, where `s` is the sum of the quotient of `l` divided by 4 and the half of the remainder of `l` divided by 4.**
