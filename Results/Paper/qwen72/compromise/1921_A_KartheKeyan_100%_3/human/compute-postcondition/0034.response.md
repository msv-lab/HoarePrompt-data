Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3.**

The list `coord` has been sorted based on the tuples it contains, but the specific values of `x` and `y` in the tuples are not known, so the exact order of the tuples after sorting cannot be determined. All other variables remain unchanged.
