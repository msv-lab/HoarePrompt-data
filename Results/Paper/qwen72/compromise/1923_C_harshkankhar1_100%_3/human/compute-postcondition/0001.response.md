Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The list `a` is created with the first element being 0.
- The remaining elements of `a` are the integers provided by the user input, split and converted to integers.
- The length of `a` is `n + 1` because it includes the initial 0 and the `n` integers from the input.
- The values of `n` and `q` remain unchanged.
- The input constraints for `t`, `n`, `q`, `c_i`, `l_i`, and `r_i` still apply.
