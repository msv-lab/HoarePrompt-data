Output State: **`n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of the original `a`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is the cumulative sum of `1` if the original `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise, starting from `b[0] = 0`. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.**
