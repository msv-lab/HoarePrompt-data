Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all given test cases. The logic implemented in the program only checks for a specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints `2` if this pattern is found, otherwise it prints `3`. This approach is too simplistic and does not account for the general structure of the problem, which involves finding the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
2. Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, considering the constraints and relationships between friends.

The provided program fails to handle cases where the friends' best friend relationships form cycles or other complex structures. For example, it would fail for the input `p = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]`, where the correct answer is `2` (inviting friends 1 and 4 would ensure friends 1, 2, and 4 come to the party), but the program would output `3`.

A more robust solution would involve graph theory concepts to identify connected components or cycles in the friendship relationships.
