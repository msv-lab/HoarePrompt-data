Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case, `num` is an input string, `out` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., elements of the sorted list of integers from each test case.**
