The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. `cases` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates the outcome of processing the 2n integers in that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`, where each inner list contains 2n integers. It returns a list of results, each indicating the outcome of processing the 2n integers in the corresponding test case.**
