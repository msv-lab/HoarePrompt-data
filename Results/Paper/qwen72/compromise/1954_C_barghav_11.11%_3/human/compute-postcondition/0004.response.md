Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the first half of the list `a` will contain the maximum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the first half of `b` will contain the minimum digit. The second half of `a` will contain the minimum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the second half of `b` will contain the maximum digit. The length of `a` and `b` remains the same, and the values of `x` and `y` are unchanged.**
