#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the first half of the list `a` will contain the maximum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the first half of `b` will contain the minimum digit. The second half of `a` will contain the minimum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the second half of `b` will contain the maximum digit. The length of `a` and `b` remains the same, and the values of `x` and `y` are unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop will print the elements of the list `a` after all iterations. The first half of `a` will contain the maximum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the second half of `a` will contain the minimum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will print the elements of the list `b` after all iterations. The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads two lines of input, each representing a string of digits (assumed to be integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and of the same length). The function then modifies these strings by swapping the minimum and maximum digits between corresponding positions in the first half and second half of the strings, respectively. After processing, it prints the modified first string, followed by the modified second string, and then an empty line. The original input values are not retained or returned.
