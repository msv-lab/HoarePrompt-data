Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the first half of the list `a` will contain the maximum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the first half of `b` will contain the minimum digit. The second half of `a` will contain the minimum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the second half of `b` will contain the maximum digit. The length of `a` and `b` remains the same, and the values of `x` and `y` are unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop will print the elements of the list `a` after all iterations. The first half of `a` will contain the maximum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the second half of `a` will contain the minimum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will print the elements of the list `b` after all iterations. The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads two lines of input, each representing a string of digits (assumed to be integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and of the same length). The function then modifies these strings by swapping the minimum and maximum digits between corresponding positions in the first half and second half of the strings, respectively. After processing, it prints the modified first string, followed by the modified second string, and then an empty line. The original input values are not retained or returned.
