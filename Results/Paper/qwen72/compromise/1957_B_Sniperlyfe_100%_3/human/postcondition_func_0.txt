The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of `nums` is set to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the remaining elements are set to the minimum of `2^(k.bit_length() - 1)` and the remaining value of `k`, ensuring that the sum of all elements in `nums` equals the initial value of `k`. After the function concludes, `k` is reduced to `0` and the list `nums` is returned.
