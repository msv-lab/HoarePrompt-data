The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where the first element is `0` and all the remaining elements are also `0`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n` where all elements are `0`, with the first element explicitly set to `0`.**
