Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is equivalent to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The rest of the list `nums` remains unchanged, with all elements still initialized to 0.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain the same as in the initial state.
