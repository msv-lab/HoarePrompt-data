Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements initialized to 0, `k` is now `k - (2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[0]` is `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[0]` from it, so the new value of `k` is `k - (2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
- The other elements of `nums` remain 0.
- The values of `n` and the length of `nums` remain unchanged.
