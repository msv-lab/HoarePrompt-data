The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` starts at 1 and will iterate up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements initialized to 0.
- `k` is now `k - (2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, which is correct for the loop to start.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
