Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is `0` and the remaining elements are `0`.**

Explanation: Since `k` is `0`, `k.bit_length()` is `1`. Therefore, `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is `2^(1 - 1) - 1 = 2^0 - 1 = 0`. Similarly, `min(2^(k.bit_length() - 1), k)` is `min(2^(1 - 1), 0) = min(1, 0) = 0`. Hence, the list `nums` will have all elements as `0`.
