The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'draw'`. The precondition describes the state of several variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) but does not influence the output of the `print` statement directly, as the `print` statement is simply printing a fixed string.

Output: **draw**
