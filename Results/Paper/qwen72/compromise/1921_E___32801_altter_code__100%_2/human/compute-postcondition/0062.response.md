Output State: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1 + a`, the difference between `x2` and `x1 + a` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1 - a`, `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.**

Explanation:
- `x1` is incremented by `a`, so `x1` is now equal to `r[2] + a`.
- Since `x2` is greater than `x1` initially, `x2` is now greater than `x1 + a`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` was even, and since `x1` has been incremented by `a`, the new difference `x2 - (x1 + a)` is still even.
- `b` was initially `x2 - x1`, and since `x1` has been incremented by `a`, `b` is now `x2 - (x1 + a)`, which simplifies to `x2 - x1 - a`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
