You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads a list of six integers from the input, representing the dimensions of a board (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`). It then determines the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob based on the positions of their chips. The function prints either 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw' depending on the game's result and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and the game's outcome has been printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` which represent the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is already in or below Alice's chip (`if x2 <= x1`). If so, it immediately prints "draw" because neither player can make a move that would result in a win.

3. **Odd and Even Distance Check:**
   - The program then checks if the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's chips is odd (`if (x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`).
   - If the distance is odd, Alice has the first move and can potentially win if she can move her chip to Bob's position in one of her moves.
   - If the distance is even, Bob has the first move and can potentially win if he can move his chip to Alice's position in one of his moves.

4. **Move Simulation:**
   - For odd distances, the program simulates Alice's moves:
     - If Alice's and Bob's chips are in the same column (`if y1 == y2`), Alice wins.
     - If not, it simulates Alice moving her chip diagonally to the right or left (`y1 += 1` or `y1 -= 1`) and then checks if the chips are in the same column.
     - If they are, Alice wins.
     - If not, it calculates the number of moves `a` Alice can make to align her chip with Bob's chip in the vertical direction.
     - It then checks if Bob can block Alice's win by moving his chip in a way that prevents Alice from reaching his position.
     - If Bob can block Alice, the game ends in a draw. Otherwise, Alice wins.

5. **Even Distance Simulation:**
   - For even distances, the program simulates Bob's moves:
     - If Alice's and Bob's chips are in the same column (`if y1 == y2`), Bob wins.
     - If not, it simulates Bob moving his chip diagonally to the right or left (`y1 += 1` or `y1 -= 1`) and then checks if the chips are in the same column.
     - If they are, Bob wins.
     - If not, it calculates the number of moves `a` Bob can make to align his chip with Alice's chip in the vertical direction.
     - It then checks if Alice can block Bob's win by moving her chip in a way that prevents Bob from reaching her position.
     - If Alice can block Bob, the game ends in a draw. Otherwise, Bob wins.

6. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the chips go out of the board boundaries (`if x2 <= x1 or x1 < 1 or x2 > n`) and prints "draw" if they do.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the logic and the steps, the program seems to correctly handle the game rules and determine the outcome based on the initial positions and the optimal moves of both players. However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

- **Odd Distance Case:**
  - The logic for moving Alice's chip diagonally and checking if she can win is correct.
  - However, the calculation of `a` and the subsequent checks for blocking moves are overly complex and may not always correctly determine the outcome.

- **Even Distance Case:**
  - The logic for moving Bob's chip diagonally and checking if he can win is correct.
  - However, the calculation of `a` and the subsequent checks for blocking moves are overly complex and may not always correctly determine the outcome.

- **Simplification:**
  - The program can be simplified by focusing on the vertical distance and the relative positions of the chips in the columns.
  - If the vertical distance is odd, Alice can always win if she is in the same column or can move to the same column in one of her moves.
  - If the vertical distance is even, Bob can always win if he is in the same column or can move to the same column in one of his moves.
  - If neither player can move to the same column, the game ends in a draw.

### Conclusion:
The program is not entirely correct due to the overly complex logic and potential issues in determining the blocking moves. A simpler and more straightforward approach would be more reliable.

Correctness: **False**
