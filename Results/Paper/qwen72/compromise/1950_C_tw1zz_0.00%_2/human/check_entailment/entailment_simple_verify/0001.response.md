### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads a time string `s` in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour `h` to the 12-hour format hour `h1` and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - The conditions cover all possible hour values from `00` to `23` and correctly map them to the 12-hour format.
   - However, there is a logical issue in the `if-elif` block. The program incorrectly sets `time` to `AM` for all hours from `01` to `12`, and `PM` for all hours from `13` to `23`. The hour `12` should be `PM` and the hour `00` should be `AM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program constructs the 12-hour format time string by concatenating `h1`, `:`, `m`, and `time` (either `AM` or `PM`).
   - The `print` function is used to output the formatted time string, and the formatting is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 PM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.
   - However, the program incorrectly converts `12:00` to `12:00 AM` instead of `12:00 PM`.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program's logic for converting hours and determining `AM` or `PM` is not entirely correct. Specifically, the hour `12` should be `PM` and the hour `00` should be `AM`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the conversion of the hour `12` to `PM` and the hour `00` to `AM`.

Correctness: **False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
