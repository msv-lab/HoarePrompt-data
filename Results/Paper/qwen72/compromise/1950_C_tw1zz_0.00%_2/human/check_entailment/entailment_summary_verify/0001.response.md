### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each time string `s` in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour `h` to the 12-hour format hour `h1` and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - The conditions cover all possible hour values from `00` to `23` and correctly map them to the 12-hour format.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program constructs the 12-hour format time string by concatenating `h1`, `:`, `m`, and `time` (either `AM` or `PM`).
   - The `print` function is used to output the formatted time string, and the `sep=''` argument ensures that there are no extra spaces between the components of the time string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 PM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program follows the problem description and handles all valid inputs as specified.
   - The logic for converting hours and determining `AM` or `PM` is correct and comprehensive.

However, there is a minor issue in the original code that needs to be addressed:
   - The condition `elif h == '12':` should set `time = 'PM'` instead of `time = 'AM'`. This is a critical mistake because 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM in 12-hour format, not 12:00 AM.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        (h1, m1) = ('', m)
        time = ''
        if h == '01':
            h1 = '01'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '02':
            h1 = '02'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '03':
            h1 = '03'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '04':
            h1 = '04'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '05':
            h1 = '05'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '06':
            h1 = '06'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '07':
            h1 = '07'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '08':
            h1 = '08'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '09':
            h1 = '09'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '10':
            h1 = '10'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '11':
            h1 = '11'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '12':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'  # Corrected from 'AM' to 'PM'
        elif h == '13':
            h1 = '01'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '14':
            h1 = '02'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '15':
            h1 = '03'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '16':
            h1 = '04'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '17':
            h1 = '05'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '18':
            h1 = '06'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '19':
            h1 = '07'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '20':
            h1 = '08'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '21':
            h1 = '09'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '22':
            h1 = '10'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '23':
            h1 = '11'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h == '00':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'  # Corrected from 'PM' to 'AM'
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was mostly accurate but missed a critical error in the handling of the 12:00 PM case.
- After correcting the error, the program is now correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False** (due to the original error, the program was incorrect)
Final: **True** (after correction, the program is correct)
