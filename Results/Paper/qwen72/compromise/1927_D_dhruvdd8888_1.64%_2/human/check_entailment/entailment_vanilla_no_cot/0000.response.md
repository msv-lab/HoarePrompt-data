Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function Call and Definition Mismatch**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but called incorrectly. The function call `func_1()` is inside a loop that iterates over `tc` (number of test cases), but the function itself is defined after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because the function is not defined at the time it is called.

2. **Incorrect Use of `input`**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the `input` function is redefined as `input = sys.stdin.readline`. This is not necessary and can lead to confusion. Instead, you should directly use `sys.stdin.readline` where needed.

3. **Logic for Finding Different Elements**:
   - The logic for finding different elements within the query range is flawed. The program uses a list `arr` to store ranges of consecutive equal elements, but it does not correctly handle the case where the query range spans multiple ranges of different elements.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the first and last elements of the query range are always the ones to check, which is not true for all cases.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program has some special cases and conditions (like `if ppp == 23` and `if tc > 5`) that are not relevant to the problem and can lead to incorrect outputs.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is not consistent with the problem description. The program should output `i` and `j` for each query, but it sometimes prints additional debug information or skips printing entirely.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Preprocess the array to identify the first and last occurrences of each element.
- For each query, check if there are any different elements within the range `[l, r]`.
- If different elements exist, output their indices; otherwise, output `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

def find_different_elements(nums, queries):
    n = len(nums)
    first_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
    last_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if first_occurrence[num] == -1:
            first_occurrence[num] = i
        last_occurrence[num] = i
    
    results = []
    for l, r in queries:
        found = False
        for i in range(l-1, r):
            for j in range(i+1, r):
                if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                    results.append((i+1, j+1))
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            results.append((-1, -1))
    
    return results

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = int(input())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    
    results = find_different_elements(nums, queries)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result[0], result[1])
    
    print()  # Optional: for separating test cases
```

This version correctly preprocesses the array and handles each query to find a pair of different elements within the specified range.
