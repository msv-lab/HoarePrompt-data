Based on the initial state provided:

- `N` remains unchanged.
- `nums` remains unchanged.
- `s` is equal to `N`.
- `e` remains unchanged.
- `num` is equal to `-1`.
- `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + start_index, end_index, value)` for each contiguous segment of the same value in `nums`, where `start_index` is the starting index of the segment, `end_index` is the index just after the segment, and `value` is the value of the segment.
- `LA` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `ppp` is equal to 23.

The `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums` as it is, since `nums` remains unchanged according to the initial state.

Output: **[the elements of the list `nums` in their original order]**
