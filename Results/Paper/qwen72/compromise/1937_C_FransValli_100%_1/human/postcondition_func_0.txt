The function operates in an interactive environment to find and print the indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the XOR value `p_i ⊕ p_j` for a fixed permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. It does this for each test case specified by the user input. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the interactive environment has received the maximum XOR indices for each test case.
