Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '='. `mini` is the last element in the list `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>', or it remains the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions (`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution, and `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=') remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates over the elements in `arr` starting from the second element.
- During each iteration, the loop compares `mini` with the current `item` in `arr`.
- If the input `res` is '>', `mini` is updated to the current `item`.
- If the input `res` is not '>', `mini` remains unchanged.
- After all iterations, `mini` will be the last element in `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>', or it will remain the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
