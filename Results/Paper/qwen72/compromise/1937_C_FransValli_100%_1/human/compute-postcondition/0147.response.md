Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists, `maxi` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `maxi` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 3.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `res`, `arr`, `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
