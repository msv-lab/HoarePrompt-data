Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the new input string, and `arr` is [3].**

The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `arr`, making `arr` a list containing the single element 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
