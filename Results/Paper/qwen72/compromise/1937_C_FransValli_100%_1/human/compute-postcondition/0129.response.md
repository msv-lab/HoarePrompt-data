Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the last input string.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'!'`, followed by the values of `maxi` and `mini`.
   - `maxi` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. Since the exact input values are not provided, we can only describe `mini` based on the given condition.

4. **Output:**
   - The string `'!'` will be printed.
   - The value of `maxi` is 0.
   - The value of `mini` is either the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **! 0 mini (where mini is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists)**
