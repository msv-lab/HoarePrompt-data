Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[2, 3]`. If `res` is `=`, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Otherwise, `arr` is `[0, 2, 3]`.** 

The value of `i` (which is 3) is appended to the list `arr`. The specific values of `arr` depend on the value of `res` as described in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `res`, `mini`) remain unchanged.
