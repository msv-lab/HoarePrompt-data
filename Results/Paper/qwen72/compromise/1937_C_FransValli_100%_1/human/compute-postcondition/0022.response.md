Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the user has input a positive integer.
   - `_` is 0. This is a variable with a value of 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1. This means `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1. This is a variable with a value of 1.
   - `maxi` is 0. This is a variable with a value of 0.
   - `arr` is [0]. This is a list containing a single element, which is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first element in the print statement is a string `'?'`.
   - The second element is `maxi`, which is 0.
   - The third element is `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the list `arr` and is 0.
   - The fourth element is `maxi` again, which is 0.
   - The fifth element is `i`, which is 1.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

4. **Output:**
   The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i` in that order.

Output: **? 0 0 0 1**
