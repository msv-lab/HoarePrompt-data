Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string, if `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1, 2]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0, 2]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.** 

The value `2` is appended to the list `arr`, which updates the list based on the initial conditions of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.
