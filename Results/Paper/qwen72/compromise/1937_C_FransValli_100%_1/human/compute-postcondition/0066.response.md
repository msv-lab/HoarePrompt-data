Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution, `mini` is the last element in the list `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>', or it remains the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer that is greater than 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
