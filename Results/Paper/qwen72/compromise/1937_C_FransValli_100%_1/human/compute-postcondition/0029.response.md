Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is [0], `res` is the input string, and `res` is not equal to '<'. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is updated to [0, 1] and `res` remains equal to '='. Otherwise, `arr` remains [0] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.***
