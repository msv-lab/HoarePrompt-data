Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `maxi` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `maxi` to 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions and the updated value of `maxi`.
