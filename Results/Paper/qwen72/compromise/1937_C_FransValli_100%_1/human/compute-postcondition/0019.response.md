Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `maxi` is updated to the value of `i` whenever the input `res` is '<'. Therefore, after the loop completes, `maxi` will hold the largest value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
- If `res` was never '<' during any iteration, `maxi` will remain 0.
- The other variables (`int(input())` and `_`) are not affected by the loop, so they retain their initial values.
