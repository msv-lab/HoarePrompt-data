Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the last input string, `mini` is `arr[0]`, `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`.**

Explanation:
- `mini` is updated to the value of `arr[0]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `res`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
