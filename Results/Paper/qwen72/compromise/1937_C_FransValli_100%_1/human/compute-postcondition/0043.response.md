Postcondition: ***`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3]. Otherwise, if `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [2, 3]. If `res` is not equal to '<' or '=', `arr` is [0, 2, 3] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.***
