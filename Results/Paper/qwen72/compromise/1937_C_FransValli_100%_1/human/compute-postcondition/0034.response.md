Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [2]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1] and `res` remains '='. Otherwise, `arr` remains [2] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` to `arr`. Since `i` is 2, `arr` becomes [2]. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
