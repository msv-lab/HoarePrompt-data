Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the last input string, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`maxi`**: This variable tracks the last index where the input was `<`. It will be the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses.
- **`res`**: This is the last input string received during the loop.
- **`mini`**: This variable tracks the smallest index where the input was `>`. If no such index exists, it remains `0`.
- **`arr`**: The array `arr` will contain all indices `i` for which the input was `=`. If the input was `<` at any point, `arr` will be reset to the last index where `<` was received. If the input was never `<`, `arr` will contain all indices where the input was `=`.

In summary, the loop modifies `i`, `res`, and `arr` based on the input responses, but `n` and `mini` remain unchanged. The final state of `arr` will depend on the sequence of input responses, specifically where `<` and `=` were received.
