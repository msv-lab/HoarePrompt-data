Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists, `arr` is `[3]`.**

The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` is now `[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
