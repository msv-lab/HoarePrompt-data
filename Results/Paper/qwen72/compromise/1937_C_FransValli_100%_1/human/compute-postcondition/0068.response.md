The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed greater than 1 and that `i` is set to 1 for the loop to start executing.

- `n` is already stated to be greater than 1, so this condition is satisfied.
- `i` is initially set to `n-1`, which is not correct for the loop to start. It needs to be set to 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
