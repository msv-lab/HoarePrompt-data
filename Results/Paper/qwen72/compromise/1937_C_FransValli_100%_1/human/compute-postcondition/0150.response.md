Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.**

The code snippet `arr = [0]` reassigns the variable `arr` to a new list containing only the integer `0`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `res`, and `mini`) remain unchanged.
