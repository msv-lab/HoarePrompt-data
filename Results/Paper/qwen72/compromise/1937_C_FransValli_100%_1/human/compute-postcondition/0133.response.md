To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range function will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is `n-1`
- `maxi` is 0
- `res` is the last input string
- `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`
- `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and that `i` is set to 1 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.**
