Based on the initial state provided:

- `int(input())` must be greater than 0, but its value is not explicitly given.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its value is not explicitly given.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

1. The first element is the string `'?'`.
2. The second and third elements are the value of `maxi`, which is 0.
3. The fourth and fifth elements are the value of `i`, which is 1.

The `flush=True` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is immediately written to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
