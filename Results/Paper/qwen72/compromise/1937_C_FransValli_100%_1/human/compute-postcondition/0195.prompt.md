Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an interactive environment where it can make queries to find the maximum XOR of any two indices in a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The input n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the function can make at most 3n queries. The permutation p is fixed and not adaptive, and the function must output the indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize p_i ⊕ p_j.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '='. `mini` is the last element in the list `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>', or it remains the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the last input string, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that received a `>` response, or the first element in `arr` if no `>` responses were received, `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
