Postcondition: ***`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [2]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `res` remains '='. Otherwise, `arr` is [0, 2] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.***
