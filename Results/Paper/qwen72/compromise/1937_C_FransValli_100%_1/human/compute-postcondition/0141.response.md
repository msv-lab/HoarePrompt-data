Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.** 

The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to a new input string provided by the user. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mini`, and the condition for `maxi` remain unchanged. If the new input string `res` is '<', `maxi` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` will remain 0.
