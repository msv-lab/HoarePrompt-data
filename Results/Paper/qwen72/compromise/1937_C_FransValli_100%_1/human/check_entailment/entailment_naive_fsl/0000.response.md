Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to follow the problem description correctly for every potential case. It uses the allowed queries to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. The program:

1. Finds the index `maxi` that maximizes the value of `p_i | p_i` (which is just `p_i` itself) by comparing each element with the current maximum.
2. Creates a list `arr` of indices that have the same maximum value as `maxi`.
3. Finds the index `mini` within `arr` that minimizes the value of `p_i | p_i` (which is just `p_i` itself) by comparing each element in `arr` with the current minimum.
4. Outputs the pair `(maxi, mini)` as the indices that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

The logic ensures that the program uses at most `3n` queries, as it performs at most `n-1` queries to find `maxi`, `n-1` queries to populate `arr`, and `n-1` queries to find `mini` within `arr`. The program also correctly handles the interactive nature of the problem by flushing the output after each query and answer. Therefore, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
