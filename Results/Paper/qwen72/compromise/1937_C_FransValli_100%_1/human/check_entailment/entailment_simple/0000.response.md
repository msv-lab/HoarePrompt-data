### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Maximum Index Search:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.
   - The variable `maxi` is initialized to 0. The goal is to find the index `maxi` such that `p_maxi` is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and makes a query to compare `p_maxi | p_maxi` with `p_i | p_i`. If the result is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`. This ensures that `maxi` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.

2. **Finding Indices with Maximum XOR:**
   - The variable `arr` is initialized with `[0]`. This list will store indices that have the same value as `p_maxi` (i.e., the maximum value).
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and makes a query to compare `p_maxi | p_arr[0]` with `p_maxi | p_i`. If the result is `<`, it updates `arr` to `[i]`. If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `arr`. This ensures that `arr` contains all indices where the value is equal to `p_maxi`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Index in `arr`:**
   - The variable `mini` is initialized to the first index in `arr`.
   - The third loop iterates through the remaining indices in `arr` and makes a query to compare `p_mini | p_mini` with `p_item | p_item`. If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`. This ensures that `mini` is the index of the minimum value in the set of indices where the value is equal to `p_maxi`.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, the function outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the pair that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly identifies the index `maxi` of the maximum value in the permutation.
- It then finds all indices where the value is equal to `p_maxi` and stores them in `arr`.
- It further identifies the minimum index `mini` in `arr`.
- The pair `(maxi, mini)` is then outputted, which should maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j` because `p_maxi` is the maximum value and `p_mini` is the minimum value among the indices where the value is equal to `p_maxi`.

### Query Count:
- The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The second loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The third loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
- The total number of queries is `3n - 3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the indices `i` and `j` that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j` using at most `3n` queries. Therefore, the program is correct.
