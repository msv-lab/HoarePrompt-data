Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. This correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Promotion Logic**:
   - The variable `k` is set to `min(n, b - a)`. This is intended to determine the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price, which is the minimum of `n` (the total number of buns) and `b - a` (the number of buns that can be sold at a price higher than `a`).
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`, which is correct.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`, plus the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Arithmetic Series Formula**:
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series is given by the formula \(\frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})\). Here, the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`. The formula used in the program is \((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k\), which is correct for the sum of the first `k` terms.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `b <= a`, the program correctly prints `a * n`.
   - When `b > a`, the program correctly calculates the profit by summing the modified prices and the usual prices.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the maximum profit based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
