Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1), `f` is `k - q`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `f` is calculated as `k - q`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is even and not a power of 2.
- `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1), where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `f` is `k - q`.
