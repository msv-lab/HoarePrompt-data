Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2 or is odd, no additional changes are made. If `k` is not a power of 2 and is even, `l` is the binary representation of the largest power of 2 less than `k` that is also even, without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).**
