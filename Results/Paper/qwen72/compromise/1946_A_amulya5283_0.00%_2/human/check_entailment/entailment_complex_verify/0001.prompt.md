You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the heap (formed from the second half of the sorted array) greater than the current median of the array for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the list.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and ensures that the input is parsed correctly.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted using `arr.sort()`.
   - Sorting is necessary to find the median, which is the element at the middle index of the sorted array.

3. **Finding the Median:**
   - The median index is calculated as `median_index = n // 2`.
   - For an array of length `n`, the median is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.
   - This is correct for both odd and even lengths, as the problem specifies the median is the element at index `ceil(n/2)`.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array using `heap = arr[median_index:]`.
   - The heap is then converted into a min-heap using `heapq.heapify(heap)`.
   - This ensures that the smallest element in the heap is always accessible at the root.

5. **Incrementing Elements to Increase the Median:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment operation is counted, and the smallest element is replaced with its incremented value using `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

6. **Output:**
   - The results are collected in a list and printed one by one for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the median of the sorted array.
- It uses a heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements that need to be increased to raise the median.
- The logic for incrementing the elements and counting the operations is sound and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
