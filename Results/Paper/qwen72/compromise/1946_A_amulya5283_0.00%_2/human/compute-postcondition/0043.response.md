Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is now a min-heap with the smallest element being greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The `results` list now contains the final value of `operations`, which is the total number of times the loop executed.
- The variable `n` remains the first element of `test_cases[1]`.
- The list `arr` remains the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is still sorted in ascending order.
- The `median_index` is still `n // 2`.
- The `current_median` is still the element at the `median_index` in the sorted `arr`.
- The `heap` is now a min-heap, but the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`. This means that all elements in the heap have been incremented enough times to exceed the `current_median`.
- The `operations` variable now holds the total number of times the loop executed, which is the number of times the smallest element in the heap was incremented to become greater than `current_median`.
