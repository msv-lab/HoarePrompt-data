To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while heap[0] <= current_median:
```

The loop will execute if the first element of `heap` (which is `heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `i` is 1
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`
- `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`
- `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`
- `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is now a min-heap
- `operations` is 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`heap[0]`**: This is the first element of the min-heap `heap`. Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap.
2. **`current_median`**: This is the median element of the sorted array `arr`. The median is the element at index `median_index`, which is `n // 2`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop will execute if `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Current State:
- `heap` contains elements from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`, and it is a min-heap.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

### Adjustment Needed:
- Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, which is `arr[median_index]`.
- Therefore, `heap[0]` is equal to `current_median`.

Given that `heap[0]` is already equal to `current_median`, the loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is already satisfied. No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is now a min-heap, `operations` is 0**
