The loop condition depends on the variables `heap[0]` and `current_median`. For the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1` and must be less than or equal to `current_median`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

Since `heap[0]` is already less than or equal to `current_median`, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is now a min-heap with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element from the original `heap`, and the new smallest element in `heap` is `smallest + 1` and must be less than or equal to `current_median`. The value `smallest + 1` has been added to `heap` and `heap` is now a min-heap with the smallest element being `smallest + 1`.**
