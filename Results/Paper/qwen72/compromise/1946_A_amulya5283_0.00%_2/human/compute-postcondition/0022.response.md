Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

The code appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains one element, which is the value of `operations`.
