Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index + 2` to the end, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the element at `arr[median_index + 1]` or the smallest element in the heap if `median_index + 1` is out of bounds.**

Explanation:
- The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the min-heap `heap` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`.
- The initial value of `smallest` was the element at `arr[median_index + 1]`.
- After executing the code, `smallest` now holds the smallest element in the heap, which was the next smallest element after `arr[median_index + 1]` (or the smallest element in the heap if `median_index + 1` was out of bounds).
- The heap `heap` is updated to no longer contain the element that was popped.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `operations`) remain unchanged.
