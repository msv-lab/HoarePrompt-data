The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the `heap` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The `heap` is a min-heap, so the smallest element is always at the root. After this operation, the `heap` will no longer contain the smallest element, and the new smallest element will be the next smallest element in the heap.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `i` is 1
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`
- `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`
- `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`
- `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is now a min-heap with the smallest element removed
- `operations` is 1
- `smallest` is the smallest element from the original `heap`
- The new smallest element in `heap` is `smallest + 1` and must be less than or equal to `current_median`

After executing the code:
- `smallest` is now the smallest element from the original `heap`
- The `heap` has had its smallest element removed, and the new smallest element in `heap` is `smallest + 1` and must be less than or equal to `current_median`

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is now a min-heap with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element from the original `heap`, and the new smallest element in `heap` is `smallest + 1` and must be less than or equal to `current_median`**
