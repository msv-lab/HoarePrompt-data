Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` + 1 to the end, `operations` is 0, `smallest` is `arr[median_index]`, and `smallest + 1` has been pushed into `heap`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `smallest` is `arr[median_index]`.
- The value `smallest + 1` is pushed into the min-heap `heap`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
