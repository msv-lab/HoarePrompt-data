The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` values, where each value represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations needed to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median for each test case.**
