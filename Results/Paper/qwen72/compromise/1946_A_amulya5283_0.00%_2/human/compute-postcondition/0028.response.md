Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

Explanation:
- The code `heap = arr[median_index:]` updates the `heap` variable to be a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from the index `median_index` to the end of `arr`.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `operations`) remain unchanged.
- The `heap` is now a list of elements from `arr` starting from the middle index (or just after the middle index if `n` is even) to the end, and all elements in this list are greater than or equal to `current_median`.
