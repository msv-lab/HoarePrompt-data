Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the heap (formed from the second half of the sorted array) greater than the current median of the array for each test case. **
