Functionality: ** The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right` (inclusive) are set to a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` and ending at `right + 1`. The elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` (inclusive) are set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are updated, and the input parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged. **
