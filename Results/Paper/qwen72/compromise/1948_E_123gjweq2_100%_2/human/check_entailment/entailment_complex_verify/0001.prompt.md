You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It divides the array `arr` of length `n` into `cliques` segments, where `cliques` is the ceiling of `n / k`. Each segment is filled with a unique value from 1 to `cliques`. The function prints the modified array `arr`, the number of segments `cliques`, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The parameters `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the function does not return any value.

#Function 2:

The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right` (inclusive) are set to a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` and ending at `right + 1`. The elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` (inclusive) are set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are updated, and the input parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to the vertices of a graph.
   - We then add edges between vertices \( i \) and \( j \) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques needed and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and determining the clique for each vertex.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the number of cliques needed. The idea is that each clique can cover up to \( k \) vertices.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop iterates over the number of cliques, calling `make_array` for each clique to assign values and determine the clique for the vertices.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These variables represent the smallest and largest values to be assigned in the current segment.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the segment.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements not in the midpoint.
   - The first loop assigns the smallest values to the vertices in the segment, starting from the midpoint and moving backwards.
   - The second loop assigns the largest values to the vertices in the segment, starting from the midpoint and moving forwards.

5. **Edge Condition**:
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is implicitly handled by the way the values are assigned in `make_array`. By assigning values in a specific pattern, the program ensures that the edge condition is satisfied for the vertices within each clique.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each vertex.

7. **Validation**:
   - The program should correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The values assigned to the vertices should be distinct and within the range 1 to \( n \).
   - The clique assignments should ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem by assigning values to vertices in a way that ensures the edge condition is met and by partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques. The logic in `make_array` ensures that the values are assigned in a pattern that satisfies the edge condition, and the overall structure of `func_1` ensures that the graph is partitioned correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
