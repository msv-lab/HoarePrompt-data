#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        elements = line.split()
        
        print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
        
    #State: The values of t, n, and a remain unchanged. The loop processes each line from the input, and for every second line starting from the third line, it prints the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique element by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads from standard input, processes every second line starting from the third line, and prints the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique element by 3 for each processed line. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`, and it does not return any value. The purpose of the function is to analyze the frequency of elements in the input lines and output a calculated value based on their counts.
