Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func()` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, considering that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the current implementation simply counts the number of times each element appears in your hand and divides it by 3, which does not follow the game rules or logic.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
According to the problem description, the expected output should be `1` because you can score 1 point by playing the second `1` after Nene has played her `2` and `3`.

However, the provided program will output:
```
0
```
This is because the program is not correctly simulating the game turns or considering the optimal play strategy for both you and Nene. It simply counts the occurrences of each card and divides by 3, which is not relevant to the game's scoring mechanism.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Identify the cards that appear more than once in your hand.
2. Simulate the game turns, considering that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
3. Calculate the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally.

The current program does not handle these aspects and thus is incorrect.
