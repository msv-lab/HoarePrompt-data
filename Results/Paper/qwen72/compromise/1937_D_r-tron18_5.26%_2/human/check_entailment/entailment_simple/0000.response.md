### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s1` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a list `arr` and a non-negative integer `times`.
   - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
   - This function is used to calculate the cumulative sums of certain indices in the lists `preOne` and `suffZero`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of the indices in `pre`, with an initial value of 0.
     - `suffZero` is a list initialized with 0, which will store the cumulative sums of the indices where the character is '<'.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with 0, which will store the results for each cell.
   - **Loop**:
     - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
     - For each cell `i`:
       - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
     - The results are stored in the `ans` list.
   - **Output**:
     - After processing all cells for a test case, the results are printed.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is based on the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters.
   - The function `func_1` is used to handle the cumulative sums efficiently.
   - The program correctly updates the cumulative sums and calculates the time for each cell based on the given rules.

### Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the pinball movement and time calculation based on the problem description. The use of cumulative sums and the conditions in the loop ensure that the program handles all cases as described.
