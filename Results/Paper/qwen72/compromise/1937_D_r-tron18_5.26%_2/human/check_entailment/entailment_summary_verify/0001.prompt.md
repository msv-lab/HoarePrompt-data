You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500,000. It calculates and prints a list of integers `ans` of length `n`, where each `ans[i]` represents a value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The string `s1` remains unchanged after the function execution. The final state of the program includes `s1` unchanged, `totalOne` set to 0, `preOne` being an empty list, and `suffZero` containing the cumulative sums of the indices of all '<' characters in `s1`, plus the initial 0. The list `ans` is printed, showing the calculated values for each index in `s1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n`.
   - Each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each starting with a pinball on a different cell, and output the number of seconds it takes to leave the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
   - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - This function is used to calculate the cumulative effect of movements and inversions.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function takes a string `s1` and an integer `n`.
   - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>'.
   - It calculates the total number of '>' characters (`totalOne`).
   - It initializes `preOne` with the cumulative sum of indices of '>'.
   - It initializes `suffZero` with a list containing a single 0.
   - It initializes `ans` with a list of zeros of length `n`.

5. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
   - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
   - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the cumulative sums and updates `ans`.
   - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time using the cumulative sums and updates `ans`.

6. **Cumulative Sums:**
   - `preOne` is used to store the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters.
   - `suffZero` is used to store the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.

7. **Time Calculation:**
   - The time calculation for each cell is based on the cumulative sums and the number of '>' and '<' characters.
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to access specific elements in the cumulative sum lists.

8. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the movement and inversion of the pinball.
- The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function helps in efficiently calculating the time for each cell.
- The logic for handling '>' and '<' characters and updating the cumulative sums is correct.
- The program correctly outputs the time for each cell for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
