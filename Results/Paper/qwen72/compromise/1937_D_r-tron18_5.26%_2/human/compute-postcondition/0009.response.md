Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500,000. It calculates and prints a list of integers `ans` of length `n`, where each `ans[i]` represents a value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The string `s1` remains unchanged after the function execution. The final state of the program includes `s1` unchanged, `totalOne` set to 0, `preOne` being an empty list, and `suffZero` containing the cumulative sums of the indices of all '<' characters in `s1`, plus the initial 0. The list `ans` is printed, showing the calculated values for each index in `s1`. **
