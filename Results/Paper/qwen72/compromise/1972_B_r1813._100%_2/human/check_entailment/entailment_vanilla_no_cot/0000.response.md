Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the game rules and the optimal play strategy. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases in a single read.

2. **Test Case Loop**: The program iterates over the test cases, extracting the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

3. **Counting 'U' Coins**: For each test case, the program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins using `s.count('U')`.

4. **Winning Condition**: The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd (`count_u % 2 == 1`). If it is, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is based on the observation that:
   - If there is an odd number of 'U' coins, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of 'U' coins for Bob.
   - If there is an even number of 'U' coins, Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of 'U' coins for Alice.
   - The game will eventually end with no 'U' coins left, and the player who is forced to make a move when there are no 'U' coins loses.

Given these points, the program correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is correct.
