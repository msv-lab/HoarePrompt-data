Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is 2, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 2 and `tleftZero` is 3. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 3 and `tleftOne` is 3.**
