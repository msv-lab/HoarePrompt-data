Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0. If `left == 0`, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, and `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left > 0`, `left` is greater than 0, `right` is `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to `n`. If `right == n` and `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right == n` and `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n` and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then the conditions for `leftZero` and `leftOne` are as described in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions for `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain unchanged.***
