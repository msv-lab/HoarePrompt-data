Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[:mid]`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[:mid]`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, no changes are made to `rightOne`. If `right` is equal to `n`, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`.***
