Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `n // 2 - 2` and greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `leftOne` is `n // 2 - 3` and greater than 0, `rightOne` is less than `(n - (n // 2 - 1) + 1) // 2` if `leftZero` is not less than `((n // 2 - 1) + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `leftOne` is decremented by 1, so `leftOne` is now `n // 2 - 3` and still greater than 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
