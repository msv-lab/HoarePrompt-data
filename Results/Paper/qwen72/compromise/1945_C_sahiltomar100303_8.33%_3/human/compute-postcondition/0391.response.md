Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, and the loop condition `leftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` is no longer true. If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n` and `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, if `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program follows the else part conditions. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, then if the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, the program follows the if part conditions. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, the program follows the else part conditions.**
