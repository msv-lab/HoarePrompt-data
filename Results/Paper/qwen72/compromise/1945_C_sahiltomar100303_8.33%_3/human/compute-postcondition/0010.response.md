Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `trightZero` to 0. Since this is the only change, all other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `trightZero`.
