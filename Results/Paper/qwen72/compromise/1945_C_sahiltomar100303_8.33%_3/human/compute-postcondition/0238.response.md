Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `right` is not equal to `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[:mid]`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[:mid]`.** 

Note: The condition `right != n` seems contradictory to the initial state where `right` is set to `n`. However, for the purpose of this task, the postcondition must include the if condition as true. Therefore, the postcondition reflects that `right` is no longer equal to `n`.
