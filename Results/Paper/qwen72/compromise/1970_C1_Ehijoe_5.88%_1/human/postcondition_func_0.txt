The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `t`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree and `t` is an integer. It then reads `n-1` edges of the tree and constructs a deque `tree` based on these edges. The function reads an additional input `start`, which is the starting node. It determines the index of `start` in the `tree` and calculates two potential moves based on the index and the value of `t`. If either of these moves is an odd number, the function prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` contains the nodes appended based on the conditions in the loop, `empty` is False if any elements were appended to `tree`, otherwise it remains True, `start` is the input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree` if `start` is in `tree`, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised, and `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.
