Postcondition: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing the integers that were appended based on the conditions in the loop, `empty` is False if any elements were appended to `tree`, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree` if `start` is in `tree`, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`, and all elements in `moves` are even.**
