Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `u_1`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in a tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and `u_1` is an integer representing the starting node (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). It also accepts a list of edges, each represented as a tuple of two integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, indicating the connections between nodes in the tree. The function returns a value based on the input parameters and the structure of the tree, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
