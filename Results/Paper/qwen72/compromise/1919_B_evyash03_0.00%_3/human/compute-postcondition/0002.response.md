The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `expression`. If `expression` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one character), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `expression` is a string of length `length` where 1 <= `length` <= 5000, and it consists only of the characters "+" and "-". This ensures that `expression` is not empty. Therefore, the loop will execute if `expression` has at least one character. At the start of the loop, `char` will be the first character in `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 <= `length` <= 5000) consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `char` is the first character in `expression`, `count` is 0, `balance` is 0**
