Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` and an integer `length`, where `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of "+" and "-" characters. It returns the number of times the balance (initially 0) goes below 0 during the iteration of the loop, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. If the final balance is not greater than 0, it returns only the number of times the balance went below 0. **
