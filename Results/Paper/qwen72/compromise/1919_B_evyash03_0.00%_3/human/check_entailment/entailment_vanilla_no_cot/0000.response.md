Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `result_length`**:
   - The program calculates `result_length` as the sum of the lengths of the parts of the string split by `'-'`. This is not necessary for the problem and does not contribute to the correct solution.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `result_length` as the second argument, but `result_length` is not used within the function. The function only uses the `expression` and calculates the penalty based on the balance of `+` and `-` characters.

3. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the penalty by counting the number of times the balance goes negative and then adding 1 if the final balance is positive. This approach does not correctly handle the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty by splitting the array optimally.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum possible penalty, you should:
- Split the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
- The optimal way to do this is to split the array at every point where the sum of the subarray so far is zero. This ensures that the penalty for each subarray is minimized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(min_penalty(expression))

def min_penalty(expression):
    balance = 0
    penalty = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance == 0:
            penalty += 0
        else:
            penalty += abs(balance)
    return penalty
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`min_penalty` Function**:
  - `balance` keeps track of the current sum of the subarray.
  - `penalty` accumulates the total penalty.
  - For each character in the expression, update the `balance`.
  - If the `balance` becomes zero, it means the subarray can be split without adding to the penalty.
  - If the `balance` is not zero, add the absolute value of the `balance` to the `penalty`.

This approach ensures that the penalty is minimized by splitting the array at optimal points.
