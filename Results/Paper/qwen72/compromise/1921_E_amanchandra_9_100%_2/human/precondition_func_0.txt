The function `func` is intended to process game scenarios but lacks parameters in its definition. For a correct implementation, it should accept parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. Each of these parameters should satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.
