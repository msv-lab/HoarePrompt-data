You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). The list `a` must contain at least one chip (1). The function should be called in a loop or similar construct to process each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop will process `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon represented by the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will be updated for each iteration, but their values will be determined by the input for each test case. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` will be recalculated for each test case based on the input `arr`. After all iterations, the initial state of `t` will be unchanged, and the loop will have printed the count of free cells for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n`. It returns information about the placement of chips in the ribbon, ensuring that the list `a` contains at least one chip.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
