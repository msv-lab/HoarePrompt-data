You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). The list `a` must contain at least one chip (1). The function should be called in a loop or similar construct to process each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop will process `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon represented by the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will be updated for each iteration, but their values will be determined by the input for each test case. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` will be recalculated for each test case based on the input `arr`. After all iterations, the initial state of `t` will be unchanged, and the loop will have printed the count of free cells for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string `arr` of length `n` where each character is either '0' (free cell) or '1' (cell with a chip). For each test case, it prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the initial state of the input `t` (number of test cases) is unchanged, and the function has printed the count of free cells for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the ribbon has chips and free cells in such a way that moving chips to form a single block requires more than one operation. For example, consider the input where the ribbon is represented as `1 0 0 1 0 1`. The expected output should be `2` because you need to move the first chip to the second position and the third chip to the fourth position to form a single block. However, the program will output `1` because it only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is incorrect.
