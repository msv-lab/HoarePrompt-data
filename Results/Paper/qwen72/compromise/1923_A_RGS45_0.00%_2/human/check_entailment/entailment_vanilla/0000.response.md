### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the ribbon configuration `arr` as a string.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (from the left).
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (from the right). This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the left by subtracting the result from `n`.

3. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - The program extracts the substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`. This ensures that `z` contains only the part of the ribbon that has chips, excluding any leading or trailing free cells.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - The program then counts the number of free cells (0s) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of free cells for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic is correct because the number of free cells between the first and last chip in the substring `z` is indeed the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where all chips are already in a single block (output is 0).

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Chip**: If there is only one chip, the program will correctly output 0 because no moves are needed.
- **All Chips Already in a Block**: If all chips are already in a single block, the program will correctly output 0.
- **Multiple Free Cells Between Chips**: The program will correctly count the number of free cells between the first and last chip and output the count.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
