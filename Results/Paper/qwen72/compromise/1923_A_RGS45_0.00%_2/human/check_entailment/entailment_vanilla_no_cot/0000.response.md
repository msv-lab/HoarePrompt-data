Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of cells `n`.
   - It reads the string `arr` representing the ribbon, where '1' indicates a chip and '0' indicates a free cell.
3. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip by reversing the string and finding the first '1'.
4. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip.
5. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (i.e., '0's) in the extracted substring, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

This approach works because the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block is equal to the number of free cells between the first and last chip. The program correctly identifies these cells and counts them, providing the correct output for each test case.
