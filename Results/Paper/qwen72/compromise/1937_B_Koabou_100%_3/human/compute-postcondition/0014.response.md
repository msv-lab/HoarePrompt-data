The function `func_1` is expected to accept parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and two binary strings representing the rows of the grid. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the binary strings are of length `n` and consist of characters '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. Assuming the correct function definition should include these parameters, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and two binary strings of length `n` consisting of '0' or '1'. For each test case, it returns a result based on the input parameters. If `n` is less than 2 or greater than 2 · 10^5, or if the binary strings are not of length `n`, the function's behavior is undefined. The specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.**
