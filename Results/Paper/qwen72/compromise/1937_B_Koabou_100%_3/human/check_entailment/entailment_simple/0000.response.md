### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - The program initializes a list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes variables `x` and `y` to track the positions where the grasshopper can switch rows to minimize the string.

3. **Loop for Path Selection:**
   - The loop iterates from the first column to the second-to-last column (0 to n-2).
   - It checks if the next cell in the top row is '0' and the current cell in the bottom row is '1'. If so, it updates `y` to the current index.
   - It checks if the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0'. If so, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the top row up to the current index and the bottom row from the current index onwards, and sets `x` to the current index. The loop then breaks.

4. **Counting Paths:**
   - The program initializes `t` to 1, which will be the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` (exclusive) to check if the substring of the bottom row from `i` to `x` matches the substring of `s` from `i + 1` to `x + 1`. If a match is found, it updates `t` to the number of possible paths from `i` to `x`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s` and the number of paths `t`.

### Issues:
- **Path Construction Logic:**
  - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The program only checks for the first occurrence where the top row has a '1' and the bottom row has a '0' and breaks the loop. This does not guarantee that the constructed string `s` is the lexicographically smallest.
  - The variable `y` is used to track the last position where the top row has a '0' and the bottom row has a '1', but it is not used effectively in the path counting logic.

- **Path Counting Logic:**
  - The path counting logic is incorrect. The program should count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string, but the current logic only checks for a specific substring match and updates `t` accordingly. This does not correctly count all possible paths.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly find the lexicographically smallest string or count the number of paths that yield this string.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
