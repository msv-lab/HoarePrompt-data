Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the binary strings are of length `n` and consist of characters '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two input strings, each of length `n`, representing the rows of the grid. The other variables (`t`, `n`) remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The list `s` is either an empty list or a modified version of the list `a` based on the loop conditions. The variable `x` is either `n - 1` or the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met. The variable `y` is the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or it remains 0 if the condition was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged. The variable `t` is either 1 or `x - i + 1` where `i` is the first index in the range `y` to `x` (exclusive) that satisfies the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The list `s` remains either an empty list or a modified version of the list `a` based on the loop conditions. The variable `x` remains either `n - 1` or the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met. The variable `y` remains the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or it remains 0 if the condition was never met.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: [elements of s concatenated together]
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is either 1 or x - i + 1, depending on whether an index i is found in the range y to x (exclusive) such that a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the user. It then processes these strings to determine a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified string `s` is a combination of the two input strings based on specific conditions, and `t` is a value calculated based on the positions where these conditions are met. The function prints the modified string `s` (if it is not empty) and the integer `t`. The function does not return any values, and its behavior is undefined if `n` is less than 2 or greater than 2 · 10^5, or if the input strings are not of length `n`.
