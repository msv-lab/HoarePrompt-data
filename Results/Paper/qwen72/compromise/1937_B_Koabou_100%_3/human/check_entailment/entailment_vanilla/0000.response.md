### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - The program aims to construct the lexicographically smallest string by choosing the optimal path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
   - It initializes `s` as an empty list and `x` and `y` as 0.
   - It iterates through the columns from 1 to `n-1` (0-indexed) to determine the optimal point to switch from the top row to the bottom row.

3. **Optimal Switch Point:**
   - The program checks if the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0'. If so, it switches to the bottom row and constructs the string `s` accordingly.
   - If no such switch is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row with the last cell of the bottom row.

4. **Counting Paths:**
   - The program initializes `t` to 1, which will be used to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` to check if there are multiple valid paths that yield the same string `s`.
   - If the substring `a[1][i:x]` matches the substring `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s` and the number of paths `t`.

### Issues:
- **Variable `y` Usage:**
  - The variable `y` is used to track the last position where the grasshopper could stay in the top row without encountering a '1' that forces it to switch to the bottom row. However, the program does not use `y` effectively in the path counting logic.
  - The logic for updating `t` should consider all valid paths from the top row to the bottom row, but the current implementation only checks a specific condition and updates `t` once.

- **Path Counting Logic:**
  - The path counting logic is flawed. It should count all valid paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string, but the current implementation only updates `t` once and does not consider all possible valid paths.
  - The correct approach would be to count the number of '0's in the top row up to the point where the switch is made and the number of '0's in the bottom row from the switch point to the end.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. It only updates `t` once and does not consider all valid paths.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
