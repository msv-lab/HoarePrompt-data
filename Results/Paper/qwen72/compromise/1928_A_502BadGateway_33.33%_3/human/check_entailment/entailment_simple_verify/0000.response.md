Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program's logic. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The problem description states that a rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and then these two smaller rectangles can be used to form a different rectangle. For this to be possible, at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` must be greater than 1, allowing for a valid cut that results in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The example provided in the original assessment, `3 2`, is a good counterexample. The program will output "no" because `b` (2) is even, but the correct output should be "yes" because the 3 × 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 × 1 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 1 × 6 rectangle.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the program is incorrect. The correct logic should indeed check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1, as this would allow for a valid cut and the formation of a different rectangle.

Final: **False**
