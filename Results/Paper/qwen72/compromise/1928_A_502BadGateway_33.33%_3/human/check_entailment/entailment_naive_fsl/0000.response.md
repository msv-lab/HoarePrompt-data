Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. 

For example, consider the input `3 2`. According to the problem description, the 3 × 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 × 1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 × 6 rectangle can be formed. However, the program will output "no" because `b` (which is 2) is even, but the correct output should be "yes".

The logic should consider both `a` and `b` and determine if either can be cut in such a way that the resulting rectangles can form a different rectangle. The correct logic should be to check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1, as this would allow for a valid cut and the formation of a different rectangle.
