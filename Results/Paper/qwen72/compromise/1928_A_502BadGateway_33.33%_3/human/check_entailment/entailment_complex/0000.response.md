Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then form a different rectangle from these two pieces. The key to solving this problem is to understand that for Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. This is because if both dimensions are odd, any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and combining them in any way will not produce a rectangle with different dimensions (since the only possible new rectangle will be a 90-degree rotation of the original).

The provided function `func_1` checks if `b` is an even number and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this approach is incomplete because it only considers the evenness of `b` and ignores `a`. For the function to be correct, it should return 'yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

Given this, the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that `a` could be even while `b` is odd, which would still allow Bob to form a different rectangle.

Correctness: **False**
