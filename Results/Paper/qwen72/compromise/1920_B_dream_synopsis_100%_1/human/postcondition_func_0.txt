The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements in an array `n`, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove `k`, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 `x`. It reads these inputs from the standard input. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after applying the allowed operations by Alice and Bob. The function prints the optimal result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the state includes the completion of `t` iterations, with `a` sorted in descending order, and `ans` containing the results of the calculations for each iteration.
