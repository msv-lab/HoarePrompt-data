To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `k + 1`. For the loop to execute, `k + 1` must be greater than 0, which means `k` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0
- `x` is the third integer read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`
- `i` is equal to `k + 1`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `t` iterations remain

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. The key variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

For the loop to execute:
- `k` must be at least 0 (which is already given)
- `i` should start at 0 (the initial value of `i` is not relevant to the loop head, but we need to ensure `i` starts at 0 for the loop to iterate correctly)

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is at least 0 and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `t` iterations remain**
