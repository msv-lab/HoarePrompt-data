The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the other variables. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers.**
