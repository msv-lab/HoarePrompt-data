The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of the element at index `i - 1` in the list `a`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0
- `x` is the third integer read from the input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`
- `i` is not 0
- `ans` is an empty list
- `t - 1` iterations remain
- `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`

After executing the code snippet:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is an empty list, `t - 1` iterations remain, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
