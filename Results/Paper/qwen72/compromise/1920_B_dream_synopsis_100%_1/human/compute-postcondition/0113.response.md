The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, where `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, and `a[:x]` represents the first `x` elements of the list `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the values of `sums`, `t` iterations remain, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` now contains one additional element which is the value of `sums`.**
