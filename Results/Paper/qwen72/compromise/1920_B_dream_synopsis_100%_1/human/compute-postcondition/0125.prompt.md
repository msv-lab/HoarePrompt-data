You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, representing the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        a.reverse()
        
        sum1 = sum(a)
        
        ans = []
        
        for i in range(k + 1):
            if i == 0:
                sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
                ans.append(sums)
            elif i + x - 1 < n:
                sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
                ans.append(sums)
            else:
                sums = sums + a[i - 1]
                ans.append(sums)
        
        print(max(ans))
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, and `t` iterations have been completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of elements in the array (n), the maximum number of elements Alice can remove (k), the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 (x), and the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The function returns the optimal result for each test case, considering the actions Alice and Bob can take.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
