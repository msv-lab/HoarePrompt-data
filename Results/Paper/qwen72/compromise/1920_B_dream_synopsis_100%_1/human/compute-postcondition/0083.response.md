Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, and `t` iterations remain.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated to the new values read from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and that `t` iterations remain is still valid.
- The condition that `k` is at least 0 is still valid.
- The conditions regarding `a`, `sum1`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
