Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, and `t - 1` iterations remain. The elements in `ans` are the values of `sums` computed during each iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`sum1`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `k + 1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `k` inclusive.
- **`ans`**: Contains `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.
- **`t - 1` iterations remain**: The number of remaining iterations of the outer loop (if any) is not affected by the inner loop.
