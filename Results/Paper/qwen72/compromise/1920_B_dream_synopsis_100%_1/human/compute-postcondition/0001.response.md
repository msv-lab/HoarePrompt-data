The code snippet `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and greater than 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified by the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer.**
