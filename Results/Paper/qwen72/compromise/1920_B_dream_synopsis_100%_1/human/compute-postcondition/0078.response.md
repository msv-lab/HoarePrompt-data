Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1, `k + 1` remains unchanged. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and `ans` is updated to include the new value of `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `ans` is updated to include the new value of `sums`.***
