Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the previous `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, and the length of `ans` is `k + 1`, and `t - 1` iterations remain.**
