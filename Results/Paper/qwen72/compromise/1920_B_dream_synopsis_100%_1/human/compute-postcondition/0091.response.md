Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `t` iterations remain, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.** 

Explanation: The variable `sums` is calculated as the difference between `sum1` (the sum of all elements in the list `a`) and twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
