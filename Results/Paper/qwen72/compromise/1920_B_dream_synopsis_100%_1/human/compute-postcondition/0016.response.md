Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
