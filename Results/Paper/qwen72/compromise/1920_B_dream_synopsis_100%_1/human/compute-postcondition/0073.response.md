The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The other variables (`i`, `k + 1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k + 1` remains unchanged, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` now includes the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` at its end.**
