Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, and `a` is equal to `b`.**

Explanation: The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. Initially, `a` was `float('inf')` and `b` was also `float('inf')`, so after the swap, `a` remains `float('inf')` and `b` also remains `float('inf')`. The condition that `a` is greater than `b` is no longer valid, as both `a` and `b` are now equal. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
