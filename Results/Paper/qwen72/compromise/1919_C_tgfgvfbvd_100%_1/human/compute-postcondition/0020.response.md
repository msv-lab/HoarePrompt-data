Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `x`, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`.**

The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` have been swapped.
