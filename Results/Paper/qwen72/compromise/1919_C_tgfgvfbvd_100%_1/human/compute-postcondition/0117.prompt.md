Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the array a of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) with elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
    c = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        if l[x] <= a:
            a = l[x]
        elif l[x] <= b:
            b = l[x]
        else:
            a = l[x]
            c += 1
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t), `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the first `n` elements of `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the first `n` elements of `l`, and `c` is the count of elements in the first `n` elements of `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (if it exists, otherwise it remains `float('inf')`), and `c` is the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or `float('inf')` if there is no second smallest integer), and `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
