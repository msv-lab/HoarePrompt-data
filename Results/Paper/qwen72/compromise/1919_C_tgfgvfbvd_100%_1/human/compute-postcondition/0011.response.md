Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to `b`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain infinity, and `c` remains 0. Additionally, `l[x]` is greater than `a`.***
