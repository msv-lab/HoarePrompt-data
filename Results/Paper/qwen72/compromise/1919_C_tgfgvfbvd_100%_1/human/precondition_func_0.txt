The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the array a of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) with elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
