The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `f` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` and `k` are integers between 1 and `n`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not described.**
