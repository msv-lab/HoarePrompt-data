### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indexing.
   - It then reads the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The function sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
   - It stores the value of the favorite cube in `x` before sorting.
   - After sorting, it compares the value of the `k`-th element in the sorted list with `x`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - If `a[k] > x`, it means the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes in the sorted list, so it prints 'NO'.
   - If `a[k] < x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely among the first `k` cubes in the sorted list, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If `a[k] == x`, it means the favorite cube could be among the first `k` cubes, but it depends on the position of the next element:
     - If `k` is the last index (`k == n - 1`), it means the favorite cube is the last one in the sorted list, so it prints 'YES'.
     - If the next element in the sorted list (`a[k + 1]`) is less than `x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely among the first `k` cubes, so it prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube could be in the first `k` cubes or not, depending on the order of equal values.

### Correctness:
The function correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or could be either removed or left based on the values and their positions in the sorted list.

- **NO**: The favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes.
- **YES**: The favorite cube is definitely among the first `k` cubes.
- **MAYBE**: The favorite cube could be among the first `k` cubes, but it depends on the order of equal values.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the function behaves as expected.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
