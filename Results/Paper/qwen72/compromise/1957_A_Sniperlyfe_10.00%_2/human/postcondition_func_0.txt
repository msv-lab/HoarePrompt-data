The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in `arr` by 4. This means the function calculates how many complete sets of 4 sticks can be formed for each unique stick length and returns the total number of such sets.
