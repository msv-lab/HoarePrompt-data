The function should accept two parameters: a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, with the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) provided.
