Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens required for placing the icons. Specifically, the way it handles the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons is incorrect. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It subtracts the number of 1x1 icons that could be placed on the screens already used for 2x2 icons, but it also adds `y * 4` which is the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons. This is redundant and incorrect.
   - The correct approach should be to first place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens, then place the remaining 1x1 icons on the remaining cells of those screens, and finally, if there are still 1x1 icons left, place them on additional screens.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect. It adds an extra screen (`+ 1`) even if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the current screen.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons without adding an extra screen unnecessarily.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when there are only 1x1 icons or only 2x2 icons, or when there are no icons at all.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def min_screens(x, y):
    # Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns)
    screen_capacity = 15
    
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    
    # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
    remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * screen_capacity - y * 4
    
    # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed in the remaining cells
    x -= min(x, remaining_cells)
    
    # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
    additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / screen_capacity)
    
    # Total number of screens required
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
    
    return total_screens

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_screens(x, y))

# Example usage
func_3()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Calculate the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

2. **Calculate the Remaining Cells**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on those screens are `screens_for_2x2 * screen_capacity - y * 4`.

3. **Place Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - Subtract the number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining cells from `x`.

4. **Calculate Additional Screens for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is `math.ceil(x / screen_capacity)`.

5. **Total Number of Screens**:
   - The total number of screens required is the sum of the screens used for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
