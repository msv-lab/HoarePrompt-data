The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written out immediately. This operation does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.**
