Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the user input.
   - If `r` is equal to '>', `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` depends on the user input `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `prev` is 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.

Given the initial state, the values are:
- `v1` = `n-1`
- `i` = 2
- `prev` = 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` = 0

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `r` is '>', the output will be: `? n-1 2 n-1 1`
- Otherwise, the output will be: `? n-1 2 n-1 0`

Final Output:
Output: **? n-1 2 n-1 [prev] (where prev is 1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0)**
