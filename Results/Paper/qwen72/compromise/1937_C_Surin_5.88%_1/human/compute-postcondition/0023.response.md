Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3.
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 3.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `v2` is 3.
- `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, all variables retain their initial values.

Given that `r` is `<`, all variables retain their initial values. Therefore:
- `v1` remains 0.
- `v2` remains 3.

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Substituting the values of `v1` and `v2`:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is 3.

So the print statement will output:
```
? 0 0 3 3
```

Output: **? 0 0 3 3**
