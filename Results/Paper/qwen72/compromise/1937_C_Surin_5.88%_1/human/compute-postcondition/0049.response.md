Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- After each iteration, `i` increments by 1.
- The variable `prev` is updated to the current value of `i` if the user input `r` is '>'.
- If `r` is never '>', `prev` remains 0.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The final value of `prev` will be the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>'.
