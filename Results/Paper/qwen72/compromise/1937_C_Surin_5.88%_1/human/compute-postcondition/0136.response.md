Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 0, and the `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.***
