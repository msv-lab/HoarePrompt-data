Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the final user input.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.
   - If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Substitute the Values:**
   - Since `v1` is `n-1`, and `i` is 1, and `prev` is 0, the print statement will substitute these values into the formatted string.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output: `? n-1 1 n-1 0`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? n-1 1 n-1 0**
