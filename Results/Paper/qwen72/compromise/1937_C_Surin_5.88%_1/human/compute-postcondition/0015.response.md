Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, the variables retain their initial values.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v2` is now 2, while the rest of the variables retain their initial values.
