Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, all variables retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v2` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 3.
- All other variables (`t`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
