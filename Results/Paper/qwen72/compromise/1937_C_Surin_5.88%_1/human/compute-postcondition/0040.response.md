Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, if `r` is '>', `prev` is 1, otherwise `prev` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the user input.
- If the user input `r` is '>', then `prev` is set to 1.
- If the user input `r` is anything other than '>', `prev` remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`) retain their initial values.
