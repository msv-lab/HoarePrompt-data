Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'. If `r` is not '<', the value of `r` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, so it will execute `n-1` times.
- Each iteration updates `v2` to the current value of `i`.
- If `r` is '<', then `v1` is updated to the current value of `v2` (which is `i`).
- After the loop completes, `v1` will be equal to `n-1` because the last value of `i` is `n-1`.
- The value of `i` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes.
- The value of `v2` will also be `n-1` after the loop finishes.
- The value of `r` will be the last input provided, and `prev` will be the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.
- The values of `t`, `kp`, and `g` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
