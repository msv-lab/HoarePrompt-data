Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the user input.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `prev` remains 1 if the previous `r` was '>', or 0 otherwise.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` depends on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `prev` is 1 if the previous `r` was '>', or 0 otherwise.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.

Given the initial state:
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `i` is 3.
- `prev` is either 2, 1, or 0 depending on the value of `r`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `r` is '>', the output will be: `? n-1 3 n-1 2`.
- If `r` is not '>' and the previous `r` was '>', the output will be: `? n-1 3 n-1 1`.
- If `r` is not '>' and the previous `r` was not '>', the output will be: `? n-1 3 n-1 0`.

Since the exact value of `r` is not specified, we need to consider all possible cases. However, for the sake of a precise answer, we will assume the most general case where `r` could be any of the mentioned values.

Output: **? n-1 3 n-1 prev (where prev is 2 if r is '>', 1 if the previous r was '>', or 0 otherwise)**
