The code snippet reads a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. This changes the value of `r` from its initial state (which could be any value based on user input) to the new input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.**
