Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the final user input.
   - `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'.
   - The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `prev`: This is the last index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'.
   - `v1`: This is `n-1`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string formatted as `! {prev} {v1}`.
   - `prev` is either the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>'.
   - `v1` is `n-1`, which is the value of `n` minus 1.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value of `prev` depends on the user input `r`.
   - The value of `v1` is `n-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! {prev} {v1} (where prev is the last index where r was '>', or 0 if r was never '>', and v1 is n-1)**
