Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is \(n - 1\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v2` is \(n - 1\).
   - `r` is the user input.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is \(n - 1\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` depends on the user input `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `prev` is 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `{v1}` is \(n - 1\).
     - `{i}` is 2.
     - `{prev}` is either 1 or 0 depending on the user input `r`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `r` is '>', the output will be: `? n-1 2 n-1 1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be: `? n-1 2 n-1 0`.

Output: **? n-1 2 n-1 {prev} (where prev is 1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0)**
