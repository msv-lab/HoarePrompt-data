Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 3.** 

The value of `prev` is updated to 3, which was the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
