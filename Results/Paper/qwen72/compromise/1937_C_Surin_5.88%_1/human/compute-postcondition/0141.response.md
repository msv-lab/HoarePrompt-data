Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is 2, and the `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.**

Explanation: The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
