### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` (the length of the permutation).

2. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it performs a query `? v1 v1 i i` to compare `p_v1 | p_v1` with `p_i | p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`. This ensures that `v1` points to the index of the maximum element in the permutation after this loop.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Element:**
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it performs a query `? v1 i v1 prev` to compare `p_v1 | p_i` with `p_v1 | p_prev`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`. This ensures that `prev` points to the index of the second maximum element in the permutation after this loop.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Analysis:
- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
  - The second loop also makes `n-1` queries.
  - Therefore, the total number of queries is `2(n-1)`, which is less than `3n` for all valid `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).

- **Correctness:**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
  - The second loop correctly identifies the index of the second maximum element in the permutation.
  - The bitwise XOR of the maximum and second maximum elements will indeed be the maximum possible XOR value for the permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem. It correctly identifies the indices of the maximum and second maximum elements and ensures that the total number of queries does not exceed `3n`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
