The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, specifically `t`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where `0 <= x, y <= 99`.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can only describe the parameters and the general nature of the function's expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**
