### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula is used to determine the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right of the 5x3 grid), `z` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Therefore, `15 * z` gives the total number of cells available on `z` screens, and `y * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`, the program adjusts the number of screens `z` by adding the ceiling of `(x - m) / 15`. This ensures that all 1x1 icons are placed on the minimum number of screens.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `z` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The formula `(y + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
- The formula `15 * z - y * 4` correctly calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing 2x2 icons.
- The adjustment for 1x1 icons is also correct, as it ensures that all 1x1 icons are placed on the minimum number of screens.

However, there is a potential issue in the program:
- The variable `a` is used to store the number of test cases, but the program should use `t` instead of `a` to match the problem description. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the logic.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description. The only issue is the variable name `a` instead of `t`, but this does not impact the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **True**
