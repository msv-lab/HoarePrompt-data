### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (though `n` is not used in the function) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.

2. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The function initializes two variables `P` and `M` to zero. `P` will count the number of '+' characters, and `M` will count the number of '-' characters.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments `P` by 1.
     - If the character is '-', it increments `M` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the difference `P - M`.

3. **Optimal Splitting:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
   - The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The function, however, does not perform any splitting of the array. Instead, it calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the penalty as defined in the problem.

4. **Expected Output:**
   - The function prints `P - M`, which is the sum of the array `a` (i.e., the total number of 1s minus the total number of -1s).
   - This is not the correct approach to find the minimum possible penalty. The correct approach would involve splitting the array in such a way that the sum of penalties is minimized.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly implement the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. It simply calculates the sum of the array, which is not the same as the penalty defined in the problem.

**Correctness: **False****
