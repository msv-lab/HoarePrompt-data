Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is an input string that must have at least one character, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `q` is the first character of `e`, and `q` is equal to '+'**. 

The value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
