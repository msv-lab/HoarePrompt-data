Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is an input string that must have at least one character, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `q` is the first character of `e`, and `q` is not equal to '+'**. 

The value of `M` has been incremented by 1, so `M` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
