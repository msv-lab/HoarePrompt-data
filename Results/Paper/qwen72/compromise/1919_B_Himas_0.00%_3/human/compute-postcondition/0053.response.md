The only objects in the loop head are `q` and `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `e`. If `e` has more than one character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is a string with at least 1 character, `q` is the first character of `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must have at least 2 characters, and `q` will be the second character of `e`.

State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character of `e`. If `q` is equal to '+', `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
