### Reasoning:

1. **Introverts Handling**:
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent. This is straightforward and correctly handled by adding `introverts` directly to the total tent count.

2. **Extroverts and Universals Handling**:
   - Extroverts need to be in a tent with exactly two others. The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the remainder (1 or 2) must be filled by universals. If there are not enough universals to fill the remainder, it is impossible to accommodate all participants, and the function should return `None`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0`. If true, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. If this condition is true, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remainder, and the function returns `None`.
   - If the above condition is false or if `extroverts % 3 == 0`, the function returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`. This is correct because it ensures that all extroverts and universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents, with each tent having up to 3 people.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result from `func_1`, which correctly accounts for the total number of tents needed.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases are correctly handled by the program:
     - For `1 2 3`, the program correctly returns `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals).
     - For `1 4 1`, the program correctly returns `-1` (4 extroverts need 2 tents, but there is only 1 universal, which is not enough to fill the remainder).
     - For `1 4 2`, the program correctly returns `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals).
     - For `1 1 1`, the program correctly returns `-1` (1 extrovert needs 2 others, but there is only 1 universal, which is not enough).
     - For `1 3 2`, the program correctly returns `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the 2 universals).
     - For `19 7 18`, the program correctly returns `28` (19 tents for introverts, 3 tents for 7 extroverts, and 6 tents for the remaining 18 universals).
     - For `0 0 0`, the program correctly returns `0` (no participants, no tents needed).
     - For `7 0 0`, the program correctly returns `7` (7 tents for 7 introverts).
     - For `0 24 0`, the program correctly returns `8` (8 tents for 24 extroverts, each tent having 3 extroverts).
     - For `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the program correctly returns `1666666667` (1000000000 tents for introverts, 333333333 tents for 1000000000 extroverts, and 333333334 tents for the remaining 1000000000 universals).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and respects the constraints and preferences of the participants. It calculates the minimum number of tents needed or returns `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.
