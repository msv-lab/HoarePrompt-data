You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three non-negative integer parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`. If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`, the function returns -1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - **Purpose:** This function calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - **Logic:**
     - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be paired with universals to form a complete tent of 3 people.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts to form a complete tent, so the function returns `None` indicating it's impossible.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents required.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - **Purpose:** This function calculates the total minimum number of tents required for all participants.
   - **Logic:**
     - It first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents required for introverts (which is simply `introverts` since each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts, the number of tents required is exactly the number of introverts.
   - **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts, the number of tents required is `ceil(extroverts / 3)`.
   - **All Universals:** If there are only universals, the number of tents required is `ceil(universals / 3)`.
   - **Mixed Cases:** The function should handle cases where there are combinations of introverts, extroverts, and universals, ensuring that all extroverts can be paired with two others, and universals can fill in the gaps.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts + 1 universal in one tent, 2 universals in another tent.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but there is only 1 universal, which is not enough to form a complete tent with the remaining 1 extrovert.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 2 universals can form 2 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert + 1 universal cannot form a complete tent of 3 people.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts + 2 universals can form 1 tent of 3 people (extroverts) and 1 tent of 2 people (universals).
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - Introverts: 19 tents (19 introverts alone)
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts + 18 universals can form 7 tents of 3 people (extroverts + universals).
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 7 (extroverts and universals) = 26 tents.
   - **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - No participants, so 0 tents.
   - **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - 7 introverts alone, so 7 tents.
   - **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - 24 extroverts, which can form 8 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 8 tents.
   - **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - 1000000000 introverts alone, so 1000000000 tents.
     - 1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals can form 1000000000 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 1000000000 (extroverts and universals) = 2000000000 tents.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and edge cases. It ensures that introverts are always alone, extroverts are always in groups of 3, and universals can fill in the gaps as needed. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
