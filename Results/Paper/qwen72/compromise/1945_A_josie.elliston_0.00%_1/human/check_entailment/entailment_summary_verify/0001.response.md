### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - **Purpose:** This function calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - **Logic:**
     - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be paired with universals to form a complete tent of 3 people.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts to form a complete tent, so the function returns `None` indicating it's impossible.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents required.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - **Purpose:** This function calculates the total minimum number of tents required for all participants.
   - **Logic:**
     - It first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents required for introverts (which is simply `introverts` since each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts + 1 universal in one tent, 2 universals in another tent.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but there is only 1 universal, which is not enough to form a complete tent with the remaining 1 extrovert.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 2 universals can form 2 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert + 1 universal cannot form a complete tent of 3 people.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts + 2 universals can form 1 tent of 3 people (extroverts) and 1 tent of 2 people (universals).
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - Introverts: 19 tents (19 introverts alone)
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts + 18 universals can form 7 tents of 3 people (extroverts + universals).
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 7 (extroverts and universals) = 26 tents.
   - **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - No participants, so 0 tents.
   - **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - 7 introverts alone, so 7 tents.
   - **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - 24 extroverts, which can form 8 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 8 tents.
   - **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - 1000000000 introverts alone, so 1000000000 tents.
     - 1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals can form 1000000000 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 1000000000 (extroverts and universals) = 2000000000 tents.

5. **Critical Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents.
   - The function `func_2` correctly adds the number of tents required for introverts to the result from `func_1`.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in `func_1` when calculating the number of tents for extroverts and universals. The ceiling function is used, but it should be applied to the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which is correct.
   - The function `func_1` should also ensure that the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3 or that there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. This is correctly handled by the condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct in its reasoning and the program handles all the given test cases and edge cases appropriately.
   - The logic and implementation of both functions are sound and meet the problem requirements.
