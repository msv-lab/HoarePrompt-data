### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n` from the input.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It then iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive). This is a common optimization to reduce the number of iterations when checking divisors.
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` by verifying `x % i == 0`.
     - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
       - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
       - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - The program then prints `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm aims to find the maximum balance, which is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
   - The key insight is that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.
   - By iterating over all divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems, the program ensures that it finds the largest possible divisor that satisfies the condition.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the divisor `i` or its corresponding quotient `x // i` can be used to form `n` sub-problems with the same difficulty.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, as the only possible balance is 1.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is a prime number, as the only divisors are 1 and `x` itself, and the program will correctly output 1 if `n > 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by considering all divisors of `x` and ensuring that the number of sub-problems `n` can be formed with the same difficulty. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
