Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum balance of a problemset, defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems, such that the sum of the difficulties equals `x` and there are `n` sub-problems.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive) using `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness of the Solution:

- **Divisors and Quotients:**
  - The program correctly identifies all divisors of `x` by iterating up to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x // i` is also a divisor.
  - The program checks if `n` can be divided into sub-problems with difficulty `i` or `x // i` and updates `ans` accordingly.

- **Balancing the Problemset:**
  - The balance of the problemset is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
  - The program aims to find the largest possible divisor of `x` that can be used to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems. This divisor will be the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties if `n` can be divided into such sub-problems.
  - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `i` can be used as the difficulty of each sub-problem, and the GCD will be `i`.
  - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `x // i` can be used as the difficulty of each sub-problem, and the GCD will be `x // i`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - For the case where `n` is equal to `x`, the only possible sub-problem difficulty is 1, which is correctly handled by the program.
  - For the case where `n` is 1, the maximum balance is `x` itself, which is also correctly handled.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by considering all possible divisors and quotients of `x` and checking if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems. The logic and the conditions are sound and cover all edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
