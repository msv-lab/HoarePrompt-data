### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, then the optimal solution is to have all sub-problems with difficulty `x // n`, and the GCD will be `x // n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x // d` is at least `n`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - Check if `n <= x // i`. If true, `i` is a potential candidate for the GCD.
     - Check if `n <= i`. If true, `x // i` is a potential candidate for the GCD.
   - The maximum of these candidates is printed as the answer.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input values `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x % i == 0` to ensure `i` is a divisor.
   - It then checks if `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is divisible by `n` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is not divisible by `n` and finds the largest divisor `d` such that `x // d` is at least `n`.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses the square root of `x` to limit the number of iterations, which is efficient for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems. It handles all the edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
