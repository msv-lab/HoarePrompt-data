The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, the number of cubes to be removed `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the values shown on the cubes. It then determines whether Dmitry's favorite cube will remain after removing `k` cubes. The function prints 'YES' if the favorite cube will definitely remain, 'NO' if it will definitely be removed, and 'MAYBE' if it might remain depending on the specific cubes removed. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided at the beginning, and the state of the variables is reset for each test case. The function does not return any values.
