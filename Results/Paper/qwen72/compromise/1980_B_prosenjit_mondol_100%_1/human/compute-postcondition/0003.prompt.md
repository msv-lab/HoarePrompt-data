You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, n, f, k, a):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `f` is an integer representing the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (1 ≤ f ≤ n), `k` is an integer representing the number of cubes to be removed (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `a` is a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are updated with new values provided by the user. After each iteration, the state of these variables is reset to the new input values for the next test case. The function prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop completes after `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`. It returns "All cubes removed" if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, "Favorite cube removed" if `f` is greater than `n - k`, and "Favorite cube remains" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
