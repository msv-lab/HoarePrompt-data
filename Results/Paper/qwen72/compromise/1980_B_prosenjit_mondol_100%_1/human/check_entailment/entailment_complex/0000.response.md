### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is appropriate since it reads input directly from the user.
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Variable Adjustments:**
   - The function adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indices, which is necessary for Python's list indexing.

3. **Sorting the List:**
   - The function sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This is correct according to the problem description, which states that the cubes are arranged in non-increasing order of their values.

4. **Determining the Favorite Cube's Value:**
   - The function correctly determines the value of the favorite cube using `x = a[f]`.

5. **Conditions for Output:**
   - The function checks if the value of the favorite cube `x` is less than the value of the k-th cube in the sorted list `a[k]`. If `a[k] > x`, it prints 'NO' because the favorite cube is definitely removed.
   - If `a[k] < x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube is definitely not removed.
   - If `a[k] == x`, it checks two additional conditions:
     - If `k == n - 1`, it means the favorite cube is the last cube in the sorted list, and it will not be removed.
     - If `a[k + 1] < x`, it means the favorite cube is the last cube with the value `x` in the sorted list, and it will not be removed.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube might be removed or not depending on the specific cubes removed.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is the last index or when there are multiple cubes with the same value.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
