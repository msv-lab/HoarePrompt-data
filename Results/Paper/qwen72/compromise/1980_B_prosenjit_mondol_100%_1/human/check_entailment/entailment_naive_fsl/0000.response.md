Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, and there are multiple cubes with the same value. Specifically, the condition `print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')` is incorrect because it assumes that if the value of the favorite cube is equal to the value of the k-th cube, and the next cube (k+1) has a smaller value, then the favorite cube must have been removed. This is not always true.

Consider the following test case:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
After sorting, the array `a` could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube (index 2, value 3) could end up in the third position, which is not removed. However, the program will output "MAYBE" because the value of the favorite cube (3) is equal to the value of the k-th cube (3), and the next cube (k+1) has a smaller value (3). This is incorrect because the favorite cube is not removed in this case.

The correct logic should consider all positions where the favorite cube could end up after sorting and determine if it is always removed, never removed, or could be removed in some cases.
