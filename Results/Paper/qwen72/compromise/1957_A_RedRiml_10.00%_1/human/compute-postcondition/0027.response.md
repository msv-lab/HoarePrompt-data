Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and has `n` elements, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, and `ln` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `palka` remains the same, as it is the input list of integers.
- The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` because each unique element is added to `pl` if it is not already present.
- The dictionary `d` will contain each element from `palka` as a key, and the value will be the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`. This is achieved by incrementing the count for each occurrence of the element in the loop.
