Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least three elements, `pl` is a list that contains the integer `i` (where `i` is the third element in `palka`), and `d` is a dictionary. If the key `i` (which is the third element in `palka`) does not exist in `d`, it is set to 1, and `i` is appended to `pl`. If the key `i` already exists in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.***
