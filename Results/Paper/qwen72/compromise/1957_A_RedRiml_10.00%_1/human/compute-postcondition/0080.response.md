To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **`d`**: This dictionary contains each unique element from the list `palka` as keys, with their corresponding counts as values.
2. **`pl`**: This is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
3. **`shapes`**: This is the number of unique elements in `pl` whose count in `d` is 3 or more.

Given this information, let's go through the steps to determine the value of `shapes`:

1. **Count the occurrences of each element in `palka`**:
   - We need to create the dictionary `d` where each key is a unique element from `palka` and the value is the count of that element in `palka`.

2. **Create the list `pl`**:
   - This list should contain the unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

3. **Determine the value of `shapes`**:
   - Iterate through the list `pl` and count how many elements have a count of 3 or more in the dictionary `d`.

Let's assume `palka` is a specific list for illustration purposes. For example, let's say `palka = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.

- **Step 1**: Create the dictionary `d`:
  ```python
  d = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}
  ```

- **Step 2**: Create the list `pl`:
  ```python
  pl = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

- **Step 3**: Determine the value of `shapes`:
  - Count the elements in `pl` whose count in `d` is 3 or more.
  - Elements in `pl` are `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - Counts in `d` are `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`.
  - Elements with a count of 3 or more are `3` and `4`.
  - Therefore, `shapes = 2`.

So, the `print(shapes)` statement will print the number of unique elements in `pl` whose count in `d` is 3 or more.

Output: **2 (where 2 is the number of unique elements in `pl` whose count in `d` is 3 or more)**
