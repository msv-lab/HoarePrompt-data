The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `palka`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `palka`. If `palka` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in `palka`. For the loop to execute one more time, `palka` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will now be the second element in `palka`.

State: **`palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`. If `i` is not in the list `pl`, then `d` contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}` or `d[i]` is increased by 1, and `i` is added to the list `pl`. If `i` is already in the list `pl`, the state remains unchanged.**
