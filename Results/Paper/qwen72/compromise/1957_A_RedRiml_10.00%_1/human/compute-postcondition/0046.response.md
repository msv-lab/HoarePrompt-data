To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop iterates over the list `palka`. For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `palka` during each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- The list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `w` must be greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers read from input and has `n` elements
- `pl` is an empty list
- `d` is an empty dictionary
- `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the original `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`

For the loop to execute, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `palka`, ensuring it contains at least one element. The other variables and lists (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `pl`, `d`, `shapes`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`palka` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`**
