The code snippet `d[i] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `d` where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Since the key `i` was not present in the dictionary before, this operation does not overwrite any existing value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and value `1`.**
