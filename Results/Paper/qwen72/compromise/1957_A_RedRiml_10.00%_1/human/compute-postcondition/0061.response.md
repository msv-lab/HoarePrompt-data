The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `palka`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in `palka`. For the loop to execute one more time, `palka` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element in `palka`.

State: **`palka` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1, and `i` is added to the list `pl`. If `i` is already in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1, and `i` remains in the list `pl`.**
