Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and has `n` elements, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the original `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`palka` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`. If `i` is not in the list `pl`, then `d` contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}` or `d[i]` is increased by 1, and `i` is added to the list `pl`. If `i` is already in the list `pl`, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1, and `i` is added to the list `pl`. If `i` is already in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1, and `i` remains in the list `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`palka` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value set to 1, and `i` is added to the list `pl`. If `i` is already in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1, and `i` remains in the list `pl`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
