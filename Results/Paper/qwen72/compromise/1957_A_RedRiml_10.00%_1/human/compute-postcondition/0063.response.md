The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the third element in `palka`, and `i` is already in `pl` or has been added to `pl`, the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` is increased by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`palka` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `i` is in `pl`, `d[i]` is increased by 1.**
