Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least three elements, `pl` is a list that contains the integer `i` (where `i` is the third element in `palka`), `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (which is the third element in `palka`) is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. The key `i` is the third element in the list `palka`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
