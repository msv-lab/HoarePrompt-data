### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track whether Alice (if `A` is `True`) or Bob (if `A` is `False`) will win.
   - It creates a sorted list `set_` of unique elements from `arr`.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest pile size (`set_[0]`) is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles in one move. Therefore, the program correctly returns 'Alice' in this case.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program then iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are all 1.
   - If the difference between any two consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, it breaks the loop and sets `not_c` to `False`.
   - During this iteration, it toggles the value of `A` for each unique pile size, which is a correct approach because each unique pile size represents a turn where the player can remove stones.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If `not_c` is `True` (i.e., all differences between consecutive pile sizes are 1), it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

### Issues:
- **Variable `n` Usage:**
  - The variable `n` is read but not used in the program. This is not a functional issue but a redundancy that can be removed for clarity.
  
- **Output State:**
  - The comment `#State: Output State: `A` is True, `not_c` is True, `set_` remains a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1.` is incorrect. The value of `A` is toggled based on the length of `set_` and the condition `not_c`, so it is not necessarily `True` at this point.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the winner based on the problem's constraints and logic.
- The logic for determining the winner is sound and follows the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.
