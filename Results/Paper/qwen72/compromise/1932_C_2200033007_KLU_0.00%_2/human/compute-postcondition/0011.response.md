Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions provided by the string `s` to create a new list `b`. Each character in `s` ('L' or 'R') determines whether to take the next element from the start or the end of `a` and append it to `b`. The function then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list in its original order. The final state of the program includes the returned list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order. **
