The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

The function returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
