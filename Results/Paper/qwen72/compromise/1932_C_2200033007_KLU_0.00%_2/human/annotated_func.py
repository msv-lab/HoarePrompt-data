#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `b` is a list of n integers where the integers from `a` have been appended to `b` in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the integer from the left side of `a` (starting from index 0) is appended to `b`. If `s[i]` is 'R', the integer from the right side of `a` (starting from index n-1) is appended to `b`. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `l` is n and `r` is -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` remains the same list of n integers, `l` is n, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, and `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in its original order, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions provided by the string `s` to create a new list `b`. Each character in `s` ('L' or 'R') determines whether to take the next element from the start or the end of `a` and append it to `b`. The function then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list in its original order. The final state of the program includes the returned list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
