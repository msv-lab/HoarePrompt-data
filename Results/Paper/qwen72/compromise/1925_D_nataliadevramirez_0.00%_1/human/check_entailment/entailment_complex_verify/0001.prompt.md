You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of friend pairs, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of the children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The values satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b, and 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9.

    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        a, b, f = friendships[i]
        
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
        
    #State: n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, friendships remains unchanged, result is the sum of (f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD) for each friendship (a, b, f) in the friendships list.

    #The program returns the result of (the sum of (f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD) for each friendship (a, b, f) in the friendships list) % MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of children), `m` (the number of friend pairs), `k` (the number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the indices of two children and their initial friendship value). It calculates the sum of the product of each friendship value `f` and the triangular number of `k`, modulo `MOD`. The function returns this final sum, also modulo `MOD`. The input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged after the function execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is unchanged. For each iteration, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are updated based on user input, and the result of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` is printed. After all iterations, `t` remains the same as the initial state, but the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are not retained and are re-assigned in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship data. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `m`, `k`, and the friendship data, and prints the result of `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged, but the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are not retained between iterations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of `friendships` as input.
     - It initializes `result` to 0.
     - It iterates over each friendship pair, and for each pair, it adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\) to `result`.
     - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - Finally, it returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
     - It reads the `m` friendship pairs and stores them in a list `friendships`.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - **Function 1**:
     - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is correctly calculated as \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\).
     - The expected value calculation is incorrect. The program assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion, which is not true. The correct expected value for each friendship pair should be the initial value `f` plus the expected number of times the pair is chosen over `k` excursions.
     - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs of children.
     - Therefore, the correct expected value for each friendship pair should be \(f + \frac{k \cdot f}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

   - **Function 2**:
     - The input reading and test case handling are correct.
     - The call to `func_1` is correct.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It assumes each pair is chosen in every excursion, which is not the case. The correct calculation involves the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

Correctness: **False**
