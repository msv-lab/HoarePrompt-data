The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `frequency_table` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.

The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty and that `num` is the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
