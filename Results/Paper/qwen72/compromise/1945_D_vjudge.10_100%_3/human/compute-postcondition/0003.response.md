Based on the initial state provided:

- `pergunta` is the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to `m`.
- `x` is the total cost of the minimum bribes from the last person to the first person in the queue.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(pergunta)
```

This statement will print the value of the variable `pergunta`.

Since `pergunta` is described as the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to `m`, the output will be this specific cost.

Output: **pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to m)**
