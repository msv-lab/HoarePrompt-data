Output State: **The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. `ci` is assigned the value `len(path_ba) // 2`. `c` is assigned the value of `path_ba[ci]`. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number, so `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, and `c` is the middle node in the reversed path from `b` to `a`.**
