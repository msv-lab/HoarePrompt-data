Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a specific integer value greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `_` is `n - 2`, `u` is `u - (n - 1)`, `v` is `v - (n - 1)`, `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes from the `bfs` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `_` is `n - 2`, `u` is `u - (n - 1)`, `v` is `v - (n - 1)`, `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes from the `bfs` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and `n`. If `n` is -1, `_` is -3, `u` is `u + 2`, `v` is `v + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes from the `bfs` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values of `b`, `n`, and `n` (the last value being the appended `n`). If `n` is -1, `_` is set to -3, `u` is set to `u + 2`, `v` is set to `v + 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `_` remains `n - 2`, `u` remains `u - (n - 1)`, and `v` remains `v - (n - 1)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes from the `bfs` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values of `b`, `n`, and `n` (the last value being the appended `n`). If `n` is -1, `_` is set to -3, `u` is set to `u + 2`, `v` is set to `v + 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `_` remains `n - 2`, `u` remains `u - (n - 1)`, and `v` remains `v - (n - 1)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
