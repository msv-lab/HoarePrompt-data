Output State: **`i` is 5, `path_ba` is a list with at least 9 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, and `(c1, 5)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 5.
- The list `path_ba` still has at least 9 elements.
- The value of `ci1` remains `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`.
- The list `ops` now includes the additional tuple `(c1, 5)` appended to the existing tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`.
