Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. `ci` is assigned the value `len(path_ba) // 2`. `c` is assigned the value of `path_ba[ci]`. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number, so `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, and `c` is the middle node in the reversed path from `b` to `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `ci` is a non-negative integer (the middle index of `path_ba`), `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops` now includes the tuple `(c, 0)`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, `c` is the middle node in the reversed path from `b` to `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `ci` is a non-negative integer (the middle index of `path_ba`), `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops` now includes the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, `c` is the middle node in the reversed path from `b` to `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `ci` is a non-negative integer (the middle index of `path_ba`) such that `ci` is at least 1, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops` now includes the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, `c` is the middle node in the reversed path from `b` to `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
