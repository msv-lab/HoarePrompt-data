You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies the `sequence` by appending integers to it and recursively calls itself until `number` is reduced to a value that no longer satisfies the condition for further processing. The function always returns the tuple (0, 0) regardless of the input. The final state of the program is that `number` is reduced, and `sequence` contains additional integers that were appended during the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The subsequences can be formed by removing elements from the array while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required array.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to construct the array by recursively breaking down the number \( X \) into smaller parts and appending elements to the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` (which is \( X - 1 \)) and `sequence` (the list to which elements will be appended).
   - It uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It then appends a sequence of integers to the `sequence` list and recursively calls itself with the remaining part of `number`.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The use of powers of 2 is crucial because the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of \( n \) distinct elements is \( 2^n \).
   - The function ensures that the sequence is constructed in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given \( X \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( X = 2 \) by printing a sequence of length 1 with a single element.
   - For larger values of \( X \), the function `func_1` is called recursively to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly generates a sequence of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The length of the generated sequence is within the limit of 200.
   - The elements of the sequence are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly designed to solve the problem as described. It uses a recursive approach to generate the required sequence and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given \( X \).

Correctness: **True**
