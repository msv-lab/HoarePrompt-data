Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is `a - 1`, `d` is the input value for the last iteration, `e` is the input value for the last iteration, `j` is `b` if the loop completed, otherwise it is the index at which the loop broke. `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop completes or breaks.**

### Natural Language Description:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- **`n`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the binary string `a`.
- **`m`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the binary string `b`.
- **`a`**: Remains the input integer that must be greater than 0, representing the number of iterations the loop will run.
- **`b`**: For the last iteration, `b` is the integer input that must be greater than 0, representing the length of the binary string `d`.
- **`c`**: For the last iteration, `c` is the integer input.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `a - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- **`d`**: For the last iteration, `d` is the binary string input of length `b`.
- **`e`**: For the last iteration, `e` is the binary string input of length `c`.
- **`j`**: After the last iteration, `j` will be `b` if the inner loop completed without breaking, or it will be the index at which the inner loop broke.
- **`k`**: After the last iteration, `k` will be the final value of `k` after the inner loop completes or breaks. This value is determined by the logic within the inner loop, which checks for the presence of characters from `d` in `e` starting from the current position `k`. If a character is found, `k` is updated to the index of the next character in `e` where the match was found. If a character is not found, `k` is set to the current index `j`. If the loop completes, `k` is set to `j + 1`.
