Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `b` is the first integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `i` is 2, `d` is the new input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is 0, `k` is 1, and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
