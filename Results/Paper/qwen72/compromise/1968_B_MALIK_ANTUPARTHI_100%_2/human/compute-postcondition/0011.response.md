Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is `j + 1`, `j` is 0, and the value `d[j]` is present in the slice `e[k:].` Additionally, either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
