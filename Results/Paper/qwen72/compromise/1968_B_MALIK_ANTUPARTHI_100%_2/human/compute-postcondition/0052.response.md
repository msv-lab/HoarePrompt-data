The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1. The condition that `j` must be less than `b` remains unchanged, so `b` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is 1, and `k` is 0.**
