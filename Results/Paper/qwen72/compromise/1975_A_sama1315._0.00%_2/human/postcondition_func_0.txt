The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of positive integers with a length between 2 and 50. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element). If there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second, the function returns 'No'.
