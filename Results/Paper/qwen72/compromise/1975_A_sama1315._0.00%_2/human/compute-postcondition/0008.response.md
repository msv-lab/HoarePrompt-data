To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`.
   - `n` is the last updated integer value from `data`.
   - `arr` is the last updated list of integers from `data`.
   - `input` is still a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.
   - `data` is the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
   - `index` is the position after the last element used in `data`.
   - `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration of the loop.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `results` list contains the results of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration of the loop.
   - The `print` statement joins all the elements of the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and prints them.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact content of `results` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `results`.
   - Each element in `results` is the result of `func_1(arr)` for a specific iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `results` list, each on a new line.

Output: **[result_1]
[result_2]
...
[result_k] (where each result_i is the result of `func_1(arr)` for the i-th iteration of the loop)**
