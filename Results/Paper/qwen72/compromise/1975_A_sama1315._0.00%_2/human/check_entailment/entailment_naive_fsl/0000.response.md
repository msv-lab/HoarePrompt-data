Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if not, it returns 'No'. However, it does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. For example, for the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the function will return 'No' because the array is not already sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]` and then swapping these parts to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, and performing the operation again to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
