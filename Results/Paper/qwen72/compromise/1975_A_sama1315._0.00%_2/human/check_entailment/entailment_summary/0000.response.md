Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix) any number of times, not just if it is already sorted.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the array `arr` and calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - The results of `func_1` for each test case are collected and printed.

3. **Problem Requirement**:
   - The program needs to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix any number of times.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by the specified operation.
   - The function `func_2` relies on `func_1` for its logic, and since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
