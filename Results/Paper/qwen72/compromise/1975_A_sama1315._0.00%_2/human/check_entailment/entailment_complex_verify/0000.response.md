Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. This is a significant oversight, as the problem description explicitly states that the array can be split and swapped any number of times to check if it can be sorted.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted using the `all` function.
   - If the array is not sorted, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - This does not account for the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a sorted state.

2. **Example from the Original Assessment**:
   - For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the function `func_1` will return 'No' because it is not already sorted.
   - However, as the original assessment correctly points out, this array can be sorted by splitting it into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]` and swapping them to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`. Then, splitting it again into `[9]` and `[2, 2, 3, 7]` and swapping them results in `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if there exists a split point such that the concatenated array `y + x` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This involves finding a split point where the prefix and suffix, when swapped, form a sorted array.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate, and the program as written does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Final: **False**
