You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted by the given operation.
   - The results for each test case are collected in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function correctly checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - However, it does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order.
  - For example, the array `[3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` is not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 5, 1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[4, 5, 1, 4, 3, 1]`, which is still not sorted. However, the correct approach would be to split it into `[3, 1, 4, 5]` and `[1, 4]` and swap them to get `[1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, which can then be split and swapped again to achieve a sorted array.
  - Therefore, `func_1` is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case, which is incorrect as explained above.
  - The function does not implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not enough to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

### Correctness:
**False**
