The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be used in a context where it processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 99, and returns a result for each test case.**
