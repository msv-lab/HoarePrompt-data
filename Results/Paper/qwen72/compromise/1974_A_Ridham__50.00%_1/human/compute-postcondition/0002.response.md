To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
2. The variable `n` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

The state of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, since `result` is mentioned and is an empty list, it can remain as is because it does not impact the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**
