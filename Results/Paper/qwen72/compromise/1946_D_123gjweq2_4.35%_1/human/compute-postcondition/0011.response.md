Output State: **new_arr is a list of non-negative integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in cur_arr up to the point where the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0, xor is 0, the bit-th bit of xor is 0, and `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `thing1` is updated to the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
- The other variables (`new_arr`, `xor`, and the bit-th bit of `xor`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the code snippet.
