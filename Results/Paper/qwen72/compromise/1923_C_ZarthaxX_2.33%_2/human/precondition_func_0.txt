The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries, respectively, `c` is a list of positive integers, and `queries` is a list of lists, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n, and the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 * 10^5.
