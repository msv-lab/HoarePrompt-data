#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries, respectively, `c` is a list of positive integers, and `queries` is a list of lists, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n, and the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to `i-1`. `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in the `nums` list from index 0 to `i-1` and 1. The values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `ones`, `sum`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array of positive integers. It takes no parameters directly but reads input from the standard input. The function first reads two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`. The function calculates two auxiliary arrays: `ones`, which tracks the cumulative count of 1s in `nums`, and `sum`, which tracks the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and 1. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a pair of integers `l` and `r` and determines if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) is satisfied, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts and sums within the range `[l, r]` of `nums`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `ones`, `sum`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged, but the function has printed the results of the queries to the standard output.
