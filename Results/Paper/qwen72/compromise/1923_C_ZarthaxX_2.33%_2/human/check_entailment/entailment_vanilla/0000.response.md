### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `testCases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays**:
   - `ones` is used to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 in the array `nums`.
   - `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum of the elements in the array `nums` after subtracting 1 from each element.

3. **Cumulative Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n` to fill the `ones` and `sum` arrays.
   - `ones[i]` is set to `ones[i-1] + 1` if `nums[i-1]` is 1, otherwise it is set to `ones[i-1]`.
   - `sum[i]` is set to `sum[i-1] + (nums[i-1] - 1)`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `l == r`, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good (it cannot satisfy the condition `a_i != b_i` for every index `i`).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of ones in the subarray `onesInRange` and the sum of the elements in the subarray after subtracting 1 from each element `sumInRange`.

5. **Good Subarray Condition**:
   - The condition to check if the subarray is good is:
     - `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`
   - This condition can be simplified to:
     - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
   - This ensures that the sum of the elements in the subarray `c[l:r]` can be split into a different array `b` such that the sum of `b` is equal to the sum of `c[l:r]` and all elements in `b` are positive and different from the corresponding elements in `c[l:r]`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The use of cumulative arrays `ones` and `sum` allows for efficient query handling, and the condition for checking if a subarray is good is correctly formulated.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
