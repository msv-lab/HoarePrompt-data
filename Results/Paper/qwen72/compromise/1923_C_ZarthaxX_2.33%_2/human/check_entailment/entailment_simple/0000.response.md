Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, but the function itself does not take any parameters. This is incorrect because the function should take the necessary inputs (`n`, `q`, `nums`, and `queries`) to process the test cases.
   - The function should be defined as `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` to match the problem description.

2. **Cumulative Arrays**:
   - The `ones` array is correctly built to store the cumulative count of 1s up to each index.
   - The `sum` array is correctly built to store the cumulative sum of the differences between each element and 1 up to each index.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the function checks if the subarray is good by:
     - First, checking if the subarray has only one element (`if l == r`). If so, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good (condition 2 fails).
     - Calculating the number of 1s in the subarray (`onesInRange`).
     - Calculating the sum of the differences between each element in the subarray and 1 (`sumInRange`).
     - Checking if the subarray can be transformed into a good array using the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`. This condition ensures that the sum of the elements in the subarray can be matched by a different set of positive integers, each different from the original elements.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is correctly formatted as 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element.
   - The function correctly handles the general case where the subarray has multiple elements.

6. **Overall Structure**:
   - The overall structure of the program is correct, but the function definition and the way it is called need to be fixed to match the problem description.

Given these points, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the function definition and how it is called. However, the logic within the function is correct.

Correctness: **False**

To make the program correct, the function definition should be updated to accept the necessary parameters, and the function should be called appropriately. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import math

def func_1(n, q, nums, queries):
    ones = [0] * (n + 1)
    sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    for l, r in queries:
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

testCases = int(input())
for _ in range(testCases):
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queries = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    func_1(n, q, nums, queries)
```

This corrected version should work as expected and handle the problem correctly.
