Postcondition: **`i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of (`initial_ans` + `sum of (2^j * initial_t) % MOD` for `j` from 1 to `k-1`) divided by `MOD`, `tmp` is `x` and the current value of `tmp` is less than 0, `_` is 0, `T` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.**
