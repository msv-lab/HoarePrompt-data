The code snippet reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the string into substrings based on spaces, and then maps each substring to an integer, finally converting the map object to a list. This list is then assigned to the variable `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is assigned the value of `t` and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line.**
