Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`.** 

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `t` to it, and then taking the remainder of this sum when divided by `MOD`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the value of `t` is still defined as the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`.
