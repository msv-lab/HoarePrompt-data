The code snippet `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to the remainder of `t` divided by `MOD`. Given that `t` is already defined as the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, applying the modulus operation again does not change the value of `t` because it is already within the range from 0 to `MOD-1`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, and the other variables (`i`, `k`, `ans`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of the previous `ans` value divided by `MOD`**.
