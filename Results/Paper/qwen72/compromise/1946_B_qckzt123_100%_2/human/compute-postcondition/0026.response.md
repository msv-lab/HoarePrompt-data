The value of `t` is multiplied by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in the list `a` multiplied by 2, `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the last element processed in the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0.
