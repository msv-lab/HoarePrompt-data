Output State: **`t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in the list `a`, `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the last element processed in the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is calculated using the formula `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is determined by the sum of `s` and `t`, modulo `MOD`, and then adjusted to ensure it is non-negative by adding `MOD` and taking the modulo `MOD` again.
