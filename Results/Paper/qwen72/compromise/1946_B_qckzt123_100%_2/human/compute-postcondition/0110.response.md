The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `k` must still be at least 2.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of the previous `ans` value divided by `MOD`**
