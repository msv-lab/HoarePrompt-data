Output State: **`t` is the maximum of the original value of `tmp` and the original value of `t`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least three elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = 0` sets the variable `tmp` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `tmp` is now 0, which may affect future calculations involving `tmp`.
