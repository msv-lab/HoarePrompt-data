You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        s = sum(a)
        (t, tmp) = (0, 0)
        for x in a:
            tmp += x
            if tmp < 0:
                tmp = 0
            t = max(tmp, t)
        ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        for i in range(k - 1):
            t *= 2
            t %= MOD
            ans += t
            ans %= MOD
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of the number of elements `n`, the number of operations `k`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the sum of the array `a` and the maximum subarray sum that is non-negative. This value is then adjusted through a series of operations defined by `k`, and the final result is printed modulo `1000000007`. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without modifying the input parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the operations to maximize the sum of the array. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum subarray sum (`t`) and then repeatedly doubles this value for each operation, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy for maximizing the sum of the array after `k` operations.

A key issue is that the program does not consider the possibility of using the entire array's sum (`s`) in the operations, especially when the array contains negative numbers. For example, if the array has a large negative sum and a small positive subarray, repeatedly doubling the positive subarray might not be the best approach compared to using the entire array's sum in the operations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2
-1 2 -1
```
- Initial array: `[-1, 2, -1]`
- Sum of the array: `0`
- Maximum subarray sum: `2`

The program will calculate:
- After the first operation: `ans = (0 + 2) % MOD = 2`
- After the second operation: `t = 2 * 2 = 4`, `ans = 2 + 4 = 6`

However, the optimal solution would be:
- After the first operation: Select the subarray `[2]` and insert its sum `2` at the end, resulting in `[-1, 2, -1, 2]` with a sum of `2`.
- After the second operation: Select the entire array `[-1, 2, -1, 2]` and insert its sum `2` at the end, resulting in `[-1, 2, -1, 2, 2]` with a sum of `4`.

Thus, the correct answer should be `4`, but the program outputs `6`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
