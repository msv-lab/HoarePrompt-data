The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the largest number Vladislav writes, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case). It returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
