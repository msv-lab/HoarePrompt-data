Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the last integer input between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`, `total` is 0.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `total` is now explicitly set to 0.
