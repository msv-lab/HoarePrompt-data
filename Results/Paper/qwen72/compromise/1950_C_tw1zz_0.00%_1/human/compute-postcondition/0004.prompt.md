You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a string s as input, where s is a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) with hh ranging from 00 to 23 and mm ranging from 00 to 59. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).

    #State: Output State: The function will take the input string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and convert it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. For each test case, it will print the converted time. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, and the final state of these variables will depend on the last input time processed. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. After the loop finishes, the state of `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will reflect the last time conversion performed. The initial state of `s` and `t` will remain unchanged. 
    #
    #For example, if the input is:
    #```
    #3
    #01:15
    #13:30
    #23:45
    #```
    #The output will be:
    #```
    #01:15 AM
    #01:30 PM
    #11:45 PM
    #```
    #And the final state of the variables will be:
    #- `h1` = '11'
    #- `m1` = '45'
    #- `time` = 'PM'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440). It returns the time in a specific format or handles multiple test cases based on the input values.
