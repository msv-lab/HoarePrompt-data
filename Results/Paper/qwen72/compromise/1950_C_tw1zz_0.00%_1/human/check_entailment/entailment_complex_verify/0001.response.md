Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the time in 24-hour format and splitting it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`). This matches the problem description and is handled correctly.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - The function uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour (`h`) to the 12-hour format hour (`h1`) and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - For hours 01 to 11, the function correctly sets `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour 12, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`. However, this is incorrect. According to the 12-hour clock, 12:00 in the afternoon should be `12:00 PM`, not `12:00 AM`.
   - For hours 13 to 23, the function correctly sets `h1` to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (13 becomes 01, 14 becomes 02, and so on) and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour 00, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`. This is correct as it ensures the output is formatted exactly as required by the problem description, with no extra spaces or leading/trailing characters.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is `00` and converts it to `12:00 PM`.
   - However, it incorrectly handles the edge case where the hour is `12` and converts it to `12:00 AM` instead of `12:00 PM`.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The function correctly converts most valid 24-hour format times to their 12-hour format equivalents.
   - The function fails to correctly convert the hour `12` to `PM` in the 12-hour format, which is a critical error.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect due to the mismanagement of the hour `12` in the 24-hour format, which should be converted to `12:00 PM` in the 12-hour format, not `12:00 AM`.

Final: **False**
