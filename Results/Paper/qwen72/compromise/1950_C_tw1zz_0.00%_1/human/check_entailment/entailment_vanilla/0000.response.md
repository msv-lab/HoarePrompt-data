Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases using `int(input())`. This is correct as it expects an integer input representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute) using `input().split(':')`. This is also correct as it matches the problem description.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - The function uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour (`h`) to the 12-hour format hour (`h1`) and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - For hours 01 to 11, the function correctly sets `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour 12, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hours 13 to 23, the function correctly sets `h1` to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (13 becomes 01, 14 becomes 02, and so on) and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour 00, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`. This is correct as it ensures the output is formatted exactly as required by the problem description, with no extra spaces or leading/trailing characters.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is `00` and converts it to `12:00 PM`.
   - It also correctly handles the edge case where the hour is `12` and converts it to `12:00 AM`.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The function correctly converts all valid 24-hour format times to their 12-hour format equivalents.
   - The function does not handle invalid inputs, but the problem description guarantees that all inputs will be valid, so this is not a concern.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
