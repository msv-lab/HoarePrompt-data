Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It initializes the permutation `p` and the score array `a` from the input.
   - It also initializes the `vis` array to keep track of visited positions and the `pathb` and `paths` lists to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the paths for Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation `p` and appending the corresponding scores from `a` to `pathb` and `paths`.
   - It uses a `while` loop to follow the permutation until a cycle is detected or the end of the game is reached, ensuring that each player's path is computed correctly.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating over their respective paths.
   - It uses a formula to compute the score for each turn, considering the current position and the remaining turns.
   - The `preb` and `pres` variables are used to keep track of the cumulative scores, and `resb` and `ress` store the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

4. **Output:**
   - The function correctly compares the final scores and prints the winner or "Draw" based on the comparison.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where the number of turns `k` is less than the length of the path, ensuring that it does not access out-of-bounds indices.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The function efficiently handles the constraints by breaking out of the loop when a cycle is detected, which is crucial for large values of `n` and `k`.

7. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is correct. It correctly simulates the game by following the rules and computing the scores for each player.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the game logic and handle the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
