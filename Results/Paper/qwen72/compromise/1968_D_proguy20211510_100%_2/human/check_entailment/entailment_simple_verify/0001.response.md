### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.
   - **Assessment:** This part is accurate and correctly handles the input.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program uses a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - It starts from `pb` and follows the permutation `p` to build the path for Bodya, appending the corresponding values from `a` to `pathb` until a cycle is detected.
   - Similarly, it starts from `ps` and follows the permutation `p` to build the path for Sasha, appending the corresponding values from `a` to `paths` until a cycle is detected.
   - **Assessment:** This part is also accurate. The cycle detection logic is correct and ensures that the paths for both players are built correctly.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `resb` and `ress` to 0, which will store the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes `preb` and `pres` to 0, which will store the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - For each position in `pathb` and `paths`, it calculates the score if the player stays at that position for the remaining turns (`k - i`).
   - It updates the cumulative score and the maximum possible score for each player.
   - **Assessment:** This part is incorrect. The program's score calculation logic is flawed. Specifically, the line `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and `curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` are incorrect. The correct approach should be to sum the scores for the first few moves and then handle the cycle by summing the scores for the cycle and multiplying by the number of full cycles, and finally adding the remaining moves.

4. **Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, the program compares them and prints the result:
     - "Bodya" if `resb` is greater than `ress`.
     - "Sasha" if `ress` is greater than `resb`.
     - "Draw" if `resb` is equal to `ress`.
   - **Assessment:** The output logic is correct, but it relies on the incorrect score calculation logic. Therefore, the output will be incorrect in some cases.

### Correctness:
- The program's current logic for score calculation is incorrect, which can lead to wrong results in some cases. Specifically, the program should handle the cycles more efficiently by summing the scores for the cycle and multiplying by the number of full cycles, and then adding the remaining moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
