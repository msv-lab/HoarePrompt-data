The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `pathb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of `pathb`. If `i` is less than the length of `pathb`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the value of the last index in the sequence `p[ps - 1]`, `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, that was visited (i.e., `vis[ps - 1]` is 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pathb` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue.

State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, and `ress` remain unchanged; `paths` is a list that now includes the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, appended to its end until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; `ps` is now the value of the last index in the sequence `p[ps - 1]`, `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, that was visited (i.e., `vis[ps - 1]` is 1); `resb` is now the maximum value between the previous `resb` (which was 0) and the current `curr` (which is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`); `i` is incremented by 1; `pathb` must have at least `i + 1` elements.**
