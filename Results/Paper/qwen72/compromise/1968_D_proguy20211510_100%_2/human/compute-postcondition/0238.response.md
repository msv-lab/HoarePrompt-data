Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `ps`, `curr`, `vis`, `paths`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` now includes the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]` at the end. `ps` is now equal to `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1 at any point during the loop execution, the loop is broken out of. `ress` and `resb` are now 0. `preb` and `pres` are now 0.**

Explanation:
- `preb` and `pres` are both set to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `ps`, `curr`, `vis`, `paths`, `ress`, `resb`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `vis[ps - 1]` is still 1.
- `paths` still includes the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]` at the end.
- `ps` is still equal to `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`.
- If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1 at any point during the loop execution, the loop is still broken out of.
- `ress` and `resb` are both still 0.
