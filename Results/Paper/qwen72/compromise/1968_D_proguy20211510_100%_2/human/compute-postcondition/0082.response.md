The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `paths`. To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can continue.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element.
- `i` is 1.
- `pres` is `pres + paths[1]`.
- `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`.
- `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `paths` must have at least one more element to ensure that `i` is still within the range of `len(paths)`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `paths` must have at least 2 elements to ensure that `i` is within the range of `len(paths)`.

State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `pres` is `pres + paths[1]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`**.
