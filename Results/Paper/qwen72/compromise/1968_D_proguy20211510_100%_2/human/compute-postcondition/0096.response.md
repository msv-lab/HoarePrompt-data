Postcondition: **After the loop completes all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` or `k`, whichever is smaller. `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`. `curr` is the value of `pres + paths[i-1] * (k - (i-1))` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. `ress` is the maximum value encountered during the loop, which is the maximum of the initial `ress` and all values of `curr` computed in each iteration. If `ress` is greater than `resb`, then `ress` is greater than `resb`. Otherwise, `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`.**
