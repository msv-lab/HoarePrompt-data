The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `paths`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(paths)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(pathb)`, and `paths` must have at least `len(pathb) + 1` elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `paths` must still have at least `i + 1` elements.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is `len(pathb) + 1`
- `paths` must have at least `len(pathb) + 2` elements

State: **`i` is `len(pathb) + 1`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`, `paths` must have at least `len(pathb) + 2` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the previous `ress` and `curr`, if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
