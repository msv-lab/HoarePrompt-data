Output State: **`i` is `len(pathb) + 1`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`, `paths` must have at least `len(pathb) + 2` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the previous `ress` and `curr`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `len(pathb) + 1`.
- The value of `preb` remains the sum of all elements in `pathb`.
- The value of `resb` remains the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`.
- The condition that `paths` must have at least `len(pathb) + 2` elements remains valid.
- The value of `curr` remains `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
- The value of `pres` remains updated to `pres + paths[i]`.
- The value of `ress` is now the maximum value between the previous `ress` and `curr`.
