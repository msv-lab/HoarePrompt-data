Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `pb` is unchanged and `pathb` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.***
