Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `ps`, and `pathb` remain unchanged, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`, `len(pathb)` must be greater than `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `ps`, and `pathb` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `i + 1`, `preb` is still `preb + pathb[i]`, and `resb` is still the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. The condition that `len(pathb)` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid.
