The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `pathb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pathb`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `pathb` is a non-empty list, and the loop is set to iterate over the length of `pathb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pathb` must still have at least one more element (i.e., it must have at least 2 elements).

State: **`i` is 1, `pathb` is a list with at least 2 elements, if `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[0]`, `resb` is the maximum of the original `resb` and `curr`**
