Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `pathb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged; `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `pathb`, `paths`, and `vis`) remain in their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
