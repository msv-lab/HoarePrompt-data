Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `curr` is now `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `paths`, `ps`, `preb`, `resb`, and `pres` remain unchanged; `ress` is now the maximum of `ress` and `curr` from the previous iteration. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `pres` is now `pres + paths[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still incremented by 1, `curr` is still calculated as `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and `ress` is still the maximum of `ress` and `curr` from the previous iteration. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
