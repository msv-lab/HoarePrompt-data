Since the `while` loop condition is `True`, the loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the program state for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, and `paths` remain unchanged; `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is now 1**
