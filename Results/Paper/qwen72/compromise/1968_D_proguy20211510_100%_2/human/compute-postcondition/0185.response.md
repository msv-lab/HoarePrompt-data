Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
- `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`.
- `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`.
- `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`.
- `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`.
- `resb` is greater than `ress`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints a constant string, which is `'Bodya'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
