The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop**
