Output State: **`i` is `len(pathb) - 1`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pres` is incremented by `paths[i]`.
- The value of `i` remains `len(pathb) - 1`.
- The value of `preb` remains the sum of all elements in `pathb`.
- The value of `resb` remains the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`.
- The value of `paths` remains a list with at least 1 element.
- The value of `curr` remains `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, but since `pres` has been updated, `curr` will also be updated to reflect the new value of `pres`.
- The condition `if k < i + 1` still holds, and if it is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
