For the `while True` loop, the loop condition is always `True`, meaning the loop will continue to execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop head does not contain any variables or conditions that can be adjusted to determine the continuation of the loop, and the loop is designed to run indefinitely, the state does not need to be modified for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `pathb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged; `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
