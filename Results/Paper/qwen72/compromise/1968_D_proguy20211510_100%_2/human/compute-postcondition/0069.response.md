The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `paths`, so we can only adjust those.

For the loop to execute, `paths` must have at least one element, and `i` must be initialized to 0 before the first iteration. Since the loop has completed all iterations, the state needs to be reset to the initial conditions for the loop to start executing again.

State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
