You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:

        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. For each test case, it reads `n` pairs of integers (a, x) where `a` indicates the type of constraint and `x` is an integer value. The function calculates and returns a list of integers, one for each test case. Each integer in the list represents the number of integers within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive) that are not in the set of constraints of type 3, where `bx` is the maximum value of `x` for constraints of type 1, and `ax` is the minimum value of `x` for constraints of type 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the result for that test case is 0. The function then prints each result on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints as described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by identifying the minimum upper bound (`ax`) and the maximum lower bound (`bx`) from the constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. It also collects all the values that `k` must not be equal to in a set `cx`. After determining the bounds, it checks if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, in which case it appends 0 to the result list, indicating no possible values for `k`. If the bounds are valid, it counts the number of values in `cx` that fall within these bounds and subtracts this count from the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax`, inclusive. This approach ensures that all constraints are considered, and the program correctly calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case.
