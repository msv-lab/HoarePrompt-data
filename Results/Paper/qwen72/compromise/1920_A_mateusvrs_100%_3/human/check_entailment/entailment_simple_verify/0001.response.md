### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that `k` must not be equal to.
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the upper bound of `k` and `bx` to a very small number (-1) to represent the lower bound of `k`.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound.
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound.
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`. This set will contain all values that `k` must not be equal to.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After reading all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If it is, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates over the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It calculates the number of valid integers `k` as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appends this value to the result list `r`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.
- **Initialization**: The initial values for `ax` and `bx` are appropriately chosen to ensure that they are updated correctly based on the constraints.
- **Constraint Processing**:
  - For type 1 constraints, `bx` is updated to the maximum value of `x` encountered.
  - For type 2 constraints, `ax` is updated to the minimum value of `x` encountered.
  - For type 3 constraints, `x` is added to the set `cx`.
- **Feasibility Check**: The program correctly checks if `bx` is greater than `ax` and appends 0 to the result list if this is the case.
- **Counting Valid Integers**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of invalid values within the range `[bx, ax]` using the set `cx`.
  - The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly determines the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all constraints and edge cases as specified.

Final: **True**
