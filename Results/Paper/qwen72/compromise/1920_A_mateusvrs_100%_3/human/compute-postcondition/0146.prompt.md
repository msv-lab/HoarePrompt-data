Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. The constraints are given as pairs (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same. `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all the integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2 or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1 or -1 if no such `x` was encountered. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` is a list containing the integer 0. If `bx` ≤ `ax`, `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all unique integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists, `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` contains the integer 0. If `bx` ≤ `ax`, `r` contains the integer `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1, `r` is a list that now contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). If `bx` > `ax`, `r` contains `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `bx` ≤ `ax`, `r` contains `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` where `tmp` is the total count of integers in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
