Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`, `a` is 1, `x` is an input integer.**

The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `-1`. Since `a` is equal to 1, and `x` is an input integer, `bx` will be `x` if `x` is greater than `-1`, otherwise `bx` will remain `-1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
