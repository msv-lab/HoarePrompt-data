Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `cx.add(x)` adds the integer `x` to the set `cx`.
- Since `cx` was either an empty set or a set containing `x`, after adding `x`, `cx` is now a set containing the integer `x`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, and `_` remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
