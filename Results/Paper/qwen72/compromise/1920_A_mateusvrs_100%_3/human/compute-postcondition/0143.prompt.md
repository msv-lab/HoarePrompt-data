Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `tmp` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop and must have at least 1 integer, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `tmp` is 1 if `i` is an integer that is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` remains 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the first integer in `cx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop and must have at least 2 integers, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `tmp` is 1 if `i` is an integer that is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` remains 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the second integer in `cx`. If `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, then `tmp` is set to 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop and must have at least 3 integers, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `tmp` is 1 if the third integer in `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` remains 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the third integer in `cx`. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is set to 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
