Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a` is 1, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `bx` remains -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `bx` remains -1.**
