Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value, which is -1.
- If `x` is greater than -1, `bx` becomes `x`.
- If `x` is less than or equal to -1, `bx` remains -1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
