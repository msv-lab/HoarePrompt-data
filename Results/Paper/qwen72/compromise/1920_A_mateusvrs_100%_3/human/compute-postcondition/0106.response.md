Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and -1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, `ax`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `bx` is now either `x` if `x` is greater than -1, or -1 if `x` is less than or equal to -1.
