Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as integers greater than 0.
- The values of `a` and `x` are now assigned the input integers provided by the user.
- The set `cx` remains empty.
- The values of `ax` and `bx` remain unchanged at 1000000007 and -1, respectively.
- The list `r` still contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions.
- The value of `_` remains `n`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
