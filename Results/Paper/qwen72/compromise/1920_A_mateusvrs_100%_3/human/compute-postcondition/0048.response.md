The code snippet `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` performs the following actions:

1. **Calculate `ax - bx + 1`**: This expression computes the difference between `ax` and `bx`, adds 1 to the result.
2. **Subtract `tmp`**: The result from the previous step is then reduced by the value of `tmp`.
3. **Append to `r`**: The final result of the above computation is appended to the list `r`.

Let's break down the impact on the variables:

- `ax` and `bx` are not changed.
- `tmp` is not changed.
- `r` is updated by appending the result of the computation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0.
- `a` and `x` are input integers.
- `cx` is a set containing all the integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2.
- `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered.
- `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered.
- `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.
- `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all the integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2 or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1 or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
