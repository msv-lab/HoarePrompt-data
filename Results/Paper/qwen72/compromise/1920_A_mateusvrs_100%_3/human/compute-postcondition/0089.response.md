The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the set `cx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` contains at least one more unique integer `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` contains at least one unique integer `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, and `i` was one of those integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must still contain at least one unique integer `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, and `i` must be the next integer in `cx`.

State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique integer `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists, `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0. `i` is the next unique integer in `cx` for which `a` was not 1 or 2.**
