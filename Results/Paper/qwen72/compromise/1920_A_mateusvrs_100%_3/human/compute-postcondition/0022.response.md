Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `cx.add(x)` adds the integer `x` to the set `cx`.
- Since `cx` was initially an empty set, after the execution, `cx` now contains the integer `x`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ax` remain unchanged.
- The value of `bx` remains -1, as the code snippet does not modify `bx`.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, and `bx` are still valid, with the only change being the addition of `x` to the set `cx`.
