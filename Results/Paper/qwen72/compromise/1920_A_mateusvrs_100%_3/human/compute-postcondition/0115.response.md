Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1. The values of `a` and `x` have been updated to the input integers.**
