Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.
- Since `bx` was initially either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, after the update, `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and -1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, `ax`, `r`, and `_` remain unchanged.
