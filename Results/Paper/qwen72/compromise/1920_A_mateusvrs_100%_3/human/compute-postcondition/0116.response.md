Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of the updated `x` and the previous `bx`, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to the maximum of the updated `x` and the previous `bx`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, `ax`, `r`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 still holds.
- The value of `bx` is now the maximum of the updated `x` and the previous `bx`.
