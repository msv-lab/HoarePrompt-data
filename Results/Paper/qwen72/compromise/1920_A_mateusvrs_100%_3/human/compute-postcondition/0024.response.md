Postcondition: ***`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `bx` remains -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` remains -1.***
