### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is part of a pair (each special character must have a matching neighbor).
   - This is correct because a special character must have exactly one neighbor that is the same, and this can only happen in pairs. Therefore, an odd number of special characters is impossible.

3. **Pattern Generation**:
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a pattern of length `n` where each pair of characters is different.
   - It uses the string 'AB' to alternate between 'A' and 'B' for each pair.
   - The pattern is generated by appending characters to a list and then joining the list into a string.
   - The specific pattern generation logic is:
     ```python
     for i in range(n // 2):
         pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
         pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
     ```
     - This logic ensures that for each pair, the first character is 'A' and the second is 'B' if `i % 2 == 0`, and vice versa if `i % 2 == 1`.
     - This results in a string like 'ABABAB' for `n = 6`, which has exactly 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5 for 'A' and positions 2, 4, 6 for 'B').

4. **Output**:
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' followed by the generated string.
   - The generated string has exactly `n` special characters, and each special character is part of a pair.
   - The output format is correct: 'YES' followed by the string.

5. **String Length**:
   - The problem specifies that the string length should be at most 200.
   - The generated string length is exactly `n`, which is within the limit since `1 \le n \le 50`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the condition for the number of special characters, generates a valid pattern, and ensures the output string length is within the specified limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
