Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read each test case's integer `n`.

2. **Condition Check**: For each `n`, it checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, it constructs a string that satisfies the condition. The string is built using a pattern that alternates between 'A' and 'B' to ensure that each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The pattern is constructed as follows:
   - For each pair of characters, it appends 'A' and 'B' alternately.
   - This ensures that the string will have exactly `n` special characters, as each pair contributes 2 special characters.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if `n` is even, and "NO" if `n` is odd.

The program meets all the requirements of the problem statement and handles the constraints correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
