### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**:
   - The function correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters. This is because special characters must come in pairs (each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which implies a pattern that repeats in pairs).
   - Therefore, the function prints 'NO' for odd `n`, which is correct.

3. **Even `n` Handling**:
   - For even `n`, the function constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters.
   - The pattern is constructed by appending 'A' and 'B' in an alternating manner, ensuring that each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and vice versa.
   - The total length of the string is `n`, which is correct because each pair of characters contributes exactly 2 special characters (one for each character in the pair).

4. **String Length**:
   - The function ensures that the string length is at most 200 by constructing it to be exactly `n` characters long, which is within the limit since `n` is at most 50.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string for even `n`, and 'NO' for odd `n`, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all the requirements of the problem, including the constraints and the output format. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
