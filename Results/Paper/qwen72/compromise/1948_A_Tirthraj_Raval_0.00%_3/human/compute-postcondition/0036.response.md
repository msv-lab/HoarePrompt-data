Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to the initial value, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list that contains the characters `'A'` and `'B'` repeated in an alternating pattern, with a total of `n` characters.***
