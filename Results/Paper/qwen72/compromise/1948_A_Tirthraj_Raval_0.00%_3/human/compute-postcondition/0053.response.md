Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'B' if `n` is even and starting with 'A' if `n` is odd, with the total length of the list being `n`. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to the initial value, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list that contains the characters 'A' and 'B' repeated in an alternating pattern, with a total of `n` characters.***
