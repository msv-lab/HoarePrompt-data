The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is the default behavior of the `range` function. The state of `func` and `alphabet` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
