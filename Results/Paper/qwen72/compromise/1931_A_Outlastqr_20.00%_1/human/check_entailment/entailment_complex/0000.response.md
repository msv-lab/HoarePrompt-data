### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums to a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
   - The lexicographically smallest word is the one that appears first in alphabetical order.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a three-letter word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Conditions:**
   - **If `n > 52`:**
     - The code constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - This means the first letter is the one at position `n - 53` in the alphabet, and the remaining two letters are 'z'.
     - For example, if `n = 78`, then `n - 53 = 25`, and the word is `alphabet[25] + 'zz' = 'yzz'`.
   - **If `n > 26`:**
     - The code constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is the one at position `n - 28` in the alphabet, and the third letter is 'z'.
     - For example, if `n = 55`, then `n - 28 = 27`, and the word is `'a' + alphabet[27] + 'z' = 'czz'`.
   - **If `n ≤ 26`:**
     - The code constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This means the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is the one at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.
     - For example, if `n = 24`, then `n - 3 = 21`, and the word is `'aa' + alphabet[21] = 'aav'`.

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The conditions are designed to handle different ranges of `n`:
     - `n > 52` handles the case where the sum is large enough to include 'z' as the last two letters.
     - `n > 26` handles the case where the sum is large enough to include 'z' as the last letter but not the second.
     - `n ≤ 26` handles the case where the sum is small enough to be represented by three letters, all of which are not 'z'.

5. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - The code ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest by:
     - Using 'a' as the first letter whenever possible.
     - Using 'z' as the last letter whenever possible.
     - Using the smallest possible letter for the middle or third position based on the value of `n`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 3`, the word is `'aaa'`.
     - For `n = 78`, the word is `'yzz'`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for the given encoded sum `n` based on the problem description and the provided conditions.

**Correctness: **True****
