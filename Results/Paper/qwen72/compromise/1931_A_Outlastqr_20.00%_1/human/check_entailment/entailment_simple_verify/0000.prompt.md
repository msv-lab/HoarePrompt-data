You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop will print a series of strings based on the input values of `n` for each iteration. Each string will be constructed according to the rules specified in the loop: if `n` is greater than 52, the string will be the letter at position `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz'; if `n` is between 27 and 52, the string will be 'a' followed by the letter at position `n - 28` in the alphabet and then 'z'; if `n` is between 3 and 26, the string will be 'aa' followed by the letter at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. The variable `word` will be reset to an empty string at the start of each iteration. The variable `alphabet` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here are a few examples where the program fails:

1. **Input: 78**
   - Expected Output: `zzz`
   - Actual Output: `aaz`
   - Explanation: The program incorrectly constructs the word by adding 'aaz' when the correct word should be 'zzz'. The logic for handling the maximum value (78) is not correctly implemented.

2. **Input: 51**
   - Expected Output: `ayz`
   - Actual Output: `ayz`
   - Explanation: The program correctly outputs 'ayz' for this input, but it does not handle other cases correctly.

3. **Input: 27**
   - Expected Output: `aab`
   - Actual Output: `aaz`
   - Explanation: The program incorrectly constructs the word by adding 'aaz' when the correct word should be 'aab'. The logic for handling values just above 26 is not correctly implemented.

4. **Input: 52**
   - Expected Output: `aaz`
   - Actual Output: `aaz`
   - Explanation: The program correctly outputs 'aaz' for this input, but it does not handle other cases correctly.

5. **Input: 28**
   - Expected Output: `aba`
   - Actual Output: `aaz`
   - Explanation: The program incorrectly constructs the word by adding 'aaz' when the correct word should be 'aba'. The logic for handling values just above 27 is not correctly implemented.

The program needs to be revised to correctly handle all potential cases for constructing the lexicographically smallest word.
