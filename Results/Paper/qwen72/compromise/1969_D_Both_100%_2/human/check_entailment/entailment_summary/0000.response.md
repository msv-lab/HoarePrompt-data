### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads and parses the input for `n` and `k`, as well as the lists of prices and bonuses.

2. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - `func_4` handles the main logic for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a heap and a list of remaining items.
   - It reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k`.
   - It reads the prices and bonuses for the items.
   - It combines the negative prices and bonuses into a list of tuples and sorts this list based on the bonuses.

3. **Heap and Profit Calculation:**
   - The function pushes the first `k` items into the heap.
   - It calculates the initial profit using `func_3`.
   - It iterates through the remaining items, updating the heap and the current profit.
   - It ensures that the current profit is maximized by considering the combined effect of prices and bonuses.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling:** The input is correctly read and parsed using `func_1` and `func_2`.
- **Logic and Algorithm:**
  - The use of a heap to manage the top `k` items is appropriate for the problem.
  - The profit calculation in `func_3` is correct, as it sums the relevant values based on the conditions.
  - The main loop in `func_4` correctly updates the heap and calculates the maximum profit by considering the combined effect of prices and bonuses.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer items than `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct maximum profit for Alice.

### Correctness:
**True**
