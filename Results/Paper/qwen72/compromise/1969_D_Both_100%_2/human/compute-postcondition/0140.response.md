To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `_` is `k` (this is a placeholder and will be reassigned in the loop)
- `k` must be greater than 0 (relevant to the loop head)
- `heap` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop head)
- `remaining_items` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` (only `k` is relevant to the loop head)
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, and `combined` is now sorted based on the second element of each tuple (not relevant to the loop head)
- `current_profit` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `max_profit` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The placeholder `_` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
