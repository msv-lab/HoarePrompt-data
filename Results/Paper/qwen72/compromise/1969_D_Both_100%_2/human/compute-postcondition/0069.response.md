Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The code snippet `prices = list(func_2())` updates the `prices` variable to be a list containing the values returned by the function `func_2()`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `prices` is now a list, and the rest of the initial conditions are still valid.
