The value of `test_cases` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_1()`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `prices`, `bonuses`) remain unchanged. Since `func_1()` returns a value, `test_cases` now holds the value returned by `func_1()`. The conditions for `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` remain valid.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices Alice pays for the items, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for the items, and both `prices` and `bonuses` have the same length `n`.**
