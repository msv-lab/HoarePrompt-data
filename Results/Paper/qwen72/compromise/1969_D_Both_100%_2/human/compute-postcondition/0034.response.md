Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains the `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 1` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. Additionally, `item[0] + item[1]` is less than 0. `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_profit += item[0]` updates the value of `current_profit` by adding the first element of the tuple `item` to it.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `item[0]` is used to update `current_profit`.
- The condition `item[0] + item[1] < 0` ensures that `item[0]` is a negative value, which will decrease `current_profit`.
