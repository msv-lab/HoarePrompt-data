Output State: **`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined`, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `k` is 0 and `_` is `k-1`, which evaluates to -1.
- `combined` is not empty, and `heap` contains all the elements from `combined`, sorted by the second element of each tuple.
- The state of `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- The code snippet assigns the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` to `current_profit`. Therefore, `current_profit` now holds the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.
- All other variables retain their initial values.
