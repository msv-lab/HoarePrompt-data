Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including `item` and excluding the smallest element), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 3` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was popped from `heap` and replaced by the previous `item`. `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_profit -= item[1]` updates the value of `current_profit` by subtracting the second element of the tuple `item` from `current_profit`.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
