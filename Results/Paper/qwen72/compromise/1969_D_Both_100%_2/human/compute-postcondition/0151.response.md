Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `_` is `k-1`. `combined` is not empty, indicating that it had enough elements initially. `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined`, sorted according to the second element of each tuple. The state of `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
