Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `test_cases` is 0, `_` is `k-1` for the last iteration, `k` is the value returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `heap` contains the `k` tuples with the highest second elements from the last `combined` list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices` for the last iteration, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit after processing all items in `combined` for the last iteration, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution for the last iteration. The variables `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged for each iteration, but their values are updated based on the return values of `func_2()` for each new iteration.**
