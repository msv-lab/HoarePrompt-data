The code snippet `combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])` sorts the list `combined` based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the elements from `bonuses`). This sorting operation modifies the order of elements in `combined`.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `_` is `k`
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `heap` is an empty list
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`
- `current_profit` is 0
- `max_profit` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `combined` is sorted based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the elements from `bonuses`).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, and `combined` is now sorted based on the second element of each tuple, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.**
