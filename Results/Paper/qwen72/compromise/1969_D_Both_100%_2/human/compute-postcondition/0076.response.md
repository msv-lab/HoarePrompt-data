The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution, but it will be set to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0**
