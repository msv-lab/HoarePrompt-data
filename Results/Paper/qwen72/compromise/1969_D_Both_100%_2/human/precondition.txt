t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k (an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n), a list of n integers representing Alice's prices (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and a list of n integers representing Bob's prices (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
