Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()` in a loop. This matches the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle a single test case. It reads the input string `s` and converts it to a list of characters, which is a valid approach for string manipulation in Python.

3. **Loop for Tandem Repeat Lengths**: The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat from `n // 2` down to `1`. This is correct because the longest possible tandem repeat in a string of length `n` is `n // 2`.

4. **Inner Loop for Substring Checks**: The inner loop checks for tandem repeats of length `j` by comparing each character `s[k]` with the character `s[k + j]`. If either character is a question mark or they are equal, the count is incremented. If the count reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the function prints `2 * j` and returns immediately.

5. **Final Output for No Tandem Repeat**: If the function completes all iterations without finding a tandem repeat, it prints `0`. This is correct according to the problem description, which states that if no tandem repeat can be formed, the output should be `0`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the string is entirely composed of question marks, it will find the longest possible tandem repeat. If the string contains no question marks and no tandem repeats, it will correctly print `0`.

7. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough for the given constraints. The worst-case time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), which is acceptable for strings of length up to 5000, especially since the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
