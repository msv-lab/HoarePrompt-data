Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a test case.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
- `k` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

### Conditions for `count`:
- If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `j` and `k`**:
   - `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `k` is fixed at 2.

2. **Check the conditions for `count`**:
   - We need to check the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`.
   - If either `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is '?' or if `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

3. **Calculate `count * 2`**:
   - If the conditions are met, `count` is 1, so `count * 2` will be 2.
   - If the conditions are not met, `count` is 0, so `count * 2` will be 0.

### Output Determination:
- The output will be either 0 or 2, depending on the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `count * 2`. However, based on the conditions given, the possible outputs are:

- **0** if `s[k]` is not '?' and `s[k + j]` is not '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
- **2** if `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.

Output: **0 or 2 (where 0 is the value if the conditions are not met, and 2 is the value if the conditions are met)**
