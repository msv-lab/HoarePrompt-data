Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a string `s` of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The function should take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s_list` where each string is a test case. `s` is now a list of characters from the input string, and `n` is the number of characters in `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j`, and `count` is the number of consecutive pairs from the start of the list that meet the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` up to the last iteration. If `count` equals `j`, the program prints `count * 2` and exits the loop. If `count` does not equal `j`, the program does not return a value and `count` remains as it was determined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the loop, the program prints `j * 2` and returns. Otherwise, `count` is the number of consecutive pairs `(s[k], s[k + j])` that satisfy the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` for `k` in the range `0` to `n - j - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, and `count` is the final count value after all iterations. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the iterations, the program prints `count * 2` and returns. Otherwise, `count` is the number of consecutive successful checks (where `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`) before the loop completes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
