The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k`, `n`, and `j`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables are used in the loop condition.

- `k` is the loop variable that starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration.
- `n` is the number of characters in the list `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` is defined as `n // 2 - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `k` is 1.
- `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
- `n - j` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n - j`. Since `k` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next value of `k` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n - j` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 2, and `n - j` must be greater than 2.**
