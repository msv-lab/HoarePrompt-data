Output State: **`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the loop, the program prints `j * 2` and returns. Otherwise, `count` is the number of consecutive pairs `(s[k], s[k + j])` that satisfy the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` for `k` in the range `0` to `n - j - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `s_list`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The loop variable `k` will have iterated through all possible values from `0` to `n - j - 1`, and will now be `n - j`.
- The variable `count` will either be the number of consecutive pairs `(s[k], s[k + j])` that satisfy the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]`, or it will have been reset to `0` if any pair did not satisfy the condition.
- If `count` ever reaches `j` during the loop, the program will print `j * 2` and return, terminating the loop early.
- If the loop completes without `count` ever reaching `j`, the final value of `count` will be the number of consecutive pairs that satisfied the condition.
