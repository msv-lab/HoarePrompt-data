The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since `n // 2` must be at least 1 for the loop to start). The variable `j` will start at `n // 2` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `j` must start at `n // 2`.

State: **`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`**
