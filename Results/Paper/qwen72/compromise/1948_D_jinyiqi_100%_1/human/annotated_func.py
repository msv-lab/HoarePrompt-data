#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a string `s` of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The function should take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s_list` where each string is a test case.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - 1`, and `count` is the final count value after all iterations. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the iterations, the program prints `count * 2` and returns. Otherwise, `count` is the number of consecutive successful checks (where `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`) before the loop completes.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single string `s` of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for specific patterns in the string by iterating over its characters and comparing them with characters at a distance `j` from them. If a pattern of length `j` is found where each character or its counterpart at distance `j` is either a question mark or identical, the function prints `2 * j` and returns. If no such pattern is found after all iterations, the function prints `0` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
