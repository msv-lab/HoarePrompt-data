Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` and how the beauty of the array is calculated.

### Problem Description:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The goal is to maximize this beauty by rearranging the elements of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in descending order. This is because the difference \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized when the largest elements are placed at the beginning of the array and the smallest elements at the end. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be as large as possible.

### Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
- It then calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- However, the problem does not require the absolute differences. It requires the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) directly, which should be maximized by sorting in descending order.

### Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i - 1] - array[i]
    return beauty
```

### Corrected `func_2`:
The `func_2` function is correct in terms of reading input and processing multiple test cases. However, it should call the corrected `func_1` function.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i - 1] - array[i]
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the absolute differences, which does not maximize the beauty as defined in the problem. The corrected program sorts the array in descending order and calculates the differences directly, which is the correct approach.
