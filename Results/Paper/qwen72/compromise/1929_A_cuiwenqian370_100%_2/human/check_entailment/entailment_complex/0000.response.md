Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), after rearranging the elements of the array in any way. The key insight is that to maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be minimized, and the sum of these minimized differences will be maximized when the array is sorted.

### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Input**: A list of integers `array` with a length of at least 2.
- **Process**:
  - The array is sorted.
  - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Output**: The sum of the absolute differences, which is the beauty of the sorted array.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly calculates the beauty of the array after sorting it. However, the problem statement does not require the absolute differences; it simply requires the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\). Therefore, the use of `abs` is unnecessary and incorrect. The correct calculation should be the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without taking the absolute value.

### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Input**: Reads input from stdin, expecting multiple test cases.
- **Process**:
  - Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
  - For each test case, reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
  - Calls `func_1` for each array and appends the result to the `results` list.
- **Output**: Prints the results for each test case.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. However, since `func_1` is incorrect due to the use of `abs`, the overall program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_1` uses `abs` to calculate the differences, which does not align with the problem statement that requires the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without taking the absolute value.

Correctness: **False**
