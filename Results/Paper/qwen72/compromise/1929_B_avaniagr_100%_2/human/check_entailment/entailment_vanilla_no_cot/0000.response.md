Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input from standard input, which is appropriate for the problem statement. It reads each line after the first one, which contains the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, which represent the size of the grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.

3. **Logic for Minimum Colored Cells**:
   - **Case 1**: If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because in a grid of size `n x n`, you can color cells in a way that each colored cell covers two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal) until you reach the middle of the grid. Thus, the minimum number of cells needed is `k / 2` rounded up.
   - **Case 2**: If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, the program prints `2 * n - 1`. This is correct because to cover `4 * n - 3` diagonals, you need to color all cells along one of the main diagonals and one cell from the remaining diagonals, which totals to `2 * n - 1` cells.
   - **Case 3**: If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, the program prints `2 * n`. This is correct because to cover all `4 * n - 2` diagonals, you need to color all cells along both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, which totals to `2 * n` cells.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the minimum number of cells needed for each test case.

The program handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
