The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `q` and `x`. Both `q` and `x` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including `q` itself if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` of all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including `q` itself if it meets the condition.**
