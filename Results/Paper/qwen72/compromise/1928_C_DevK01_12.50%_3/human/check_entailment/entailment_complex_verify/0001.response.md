### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling are consistent with the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The output is the number of different \( k \) values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy the pattern.
   - If \( n \) is in the first \( k \) positions, \( x \) must be in the range \( 1 \) to \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is in the next \( k-2 \) positions, \( x \) must be in the range \( k-1 \) to \( 2 \).

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The position \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = (2k - 2) \cdot m + p \) where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( p \) is the position within the current cycle.
   - The number \( x \) received by Vasya must match the position \( p \) within the cycle.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and adds it to the list if it is.
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( \sqrt{q} \) and adds both the divisor and the quotient to the list if they meet the condition.

6. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If it is, the answer is 0 because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.
   - It then calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find the possible values of \( k \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find additional possible values of \( k \).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
  - It reads \( n \) and \( x \) for each test case.

- **Odd Check:**
  - The program correctly checks if \( y = n + x \) is odd and prints 0 if it is. This is correct because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
  - It handles the square root check and the iteration through divisors correctly.
  - However, the function should return a list of integers, not a list containing the square root as a float. The square root check should be adjusted to ensure it returns an integer.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines the results from two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
  - It prints the length of the resulting list, which is the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Correctness of the Program:

- **Function `func_1` Issue:**
  - The function `func_1` has a minor issue where it might add the square root of \( q \) as a float to the list `M`. This should be fixed to ensure that only integers are added.
  - The correct check should be `if w == int(w) and w >= x - 1:` instead of `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:`.

- **Main Logic:**
  - The main logic is correct and follows the problem constraints and examples provided.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment:**
  - The original assessment is mostly correct but overlooks the potential issue with the square root check in `func_1`.

- **Corrected Function:**
  - The function `func_1` should be corrected to ensure it only adds integers to the list `M`.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The program is correct with the minor adjustment to the `func_1` function.

### Final: **True**

The program is correct with the minor adjustment to the `func_1` function to ensure it only adds integers to the list `M`.
