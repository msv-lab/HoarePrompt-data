### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a pattern where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), followed by the next \( k-2 \) people numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya is given his position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received. The task is to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \), and initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is correct because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1(q, x)`.
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)`.
   - It combines the results from both function calls, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list `M`.
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds the square root to `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \( q \). For each integer \( i \), it checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( q \) and if \( i \) or \( q // i \) is greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds \( i \) or \( q // i \) to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M` containing all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies that \( y \) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - The program combines the results from both function calls and removes duplicates, which is necessary to avoid counting the same \( k \) multiple times.
   - The program handles the constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) and ensures that the answer is finite.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
