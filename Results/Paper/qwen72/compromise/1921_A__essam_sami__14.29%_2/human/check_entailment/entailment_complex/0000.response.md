Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. However, the approach taken in the program is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the coordinates of the four corners for each test case.
2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points: `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`. This is done using the formula for the squared Euclidean distance: `(x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)`.
3. **Area Calculation**: The program then prints the smaller of these two squared distances. This is incorrect because:
   - The area of a square is the square of the side length.
   - The side length of the square can be determined by the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.
   - The program does not ensure that the points it is using to calculate the distances are actually adjacent corners of the square.

To correctly determine the area of the square, the program should:
1. Identify the side length of the square by finding the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.
2. Square this difference to get the area.

The current program does not follow this correct approach and instead calculates the squared distances between two arbitrary pairs of points, which may not be adjacent corners.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
