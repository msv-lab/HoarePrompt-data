You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in each `a` array, where a "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to count the number of "beautiful" pairs in the list `a`. A "beautiful" pair `(a[i], a[j])` is defined as a pair where `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of "beautiful" pairs for the corresponding test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `y`. The current implementation only checks if the current number `num` can form a beautiful pair with any previously seen number based on the modulo conditions. However, it does not ensure that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` for all pairs `(i, j)`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- `n = 4`, `x = 3`, `y = 2`
- `a = [1, 2, 4, 5]`

The expected beautiful pairs are:
- \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_4 = 1 + 5 = 6\) (divisible by 3) and \(a_1 - a_4 = 1 - 5 = -4\) (divisible by 2).

However, the program will incorrectly count the pair \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\) as beautiful because:
- \(a_2 + a_3 = 2 + 4 = 6\) (divisible by 3) but \(a_2 - a_3 = 2 - 4 = -2\) (divisible by 2), which is incorrect because the pair \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\) should not be counted as beautiful.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
