Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 0 if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, otherwise `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] + 1`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.***
