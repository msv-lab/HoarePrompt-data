Output State: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `a` must have at least one more element, `mod_x` is `num % x`.** 

Explanation: The value of `mod_x` is calculated as the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. The initial conditions that `num` is the next element in `a` and `a` must have at least one more element remain unchanged.
