The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses through the elements of `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples
- `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing one element which is 0
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element
- `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1
- `beautiful_count` remains 0

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `a` must be considered. Since `a` contains at least one element, and assuming the previous iteration processed the first element, the next iteration will process the second element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains 0, `num` is the second element in `a`**
