To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

1. **`test_cases`**: This must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute at least once. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not run.
2. **`case`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `case` is not defined, but it will be set to the first element of `test_cases` when the loop begins.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a`.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. The variable `case` will be set to the first tuple in `test_cases` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**.
