The code snippet assigns the values from the dictionary `case['params']` to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since `case` is the first tuple in the list `test_cases`, and each tuple contains a dictionary with a key `'params'` that holds a tuple of three values, these values are unpacked into `n`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.**
