Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.** 

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `required_mod_x` using the formula `(x - mod_x) % x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `required_mod_x` is now determined based on the values of `x` and `mod_x`.
