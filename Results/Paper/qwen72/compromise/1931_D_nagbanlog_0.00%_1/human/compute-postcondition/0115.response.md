Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples.
   - `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0.
   - `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
   - `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
   - `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `num` is the second element of `a`.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `num` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the result of `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is the result of `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is the result of `num % y`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - `num` is explicitly defined as the second element of `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is the value needed to make `num` divisible by `x` (i.e., the difference between `x` and `mod_x`, modulo `x`).
   - `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y` because it is defined as `num % y`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the second element of the list a, mod_x is num % x, mod_y is num % y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is num % y)**
