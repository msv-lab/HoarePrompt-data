Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples.
- `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`.
- `results` is a list containing one element which is 0.
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` as they are defined in the second tuple of `test_cases`.

Let's break it down:

- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the array from `case['array']`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not explicitly provided, we will use the placeholders to describe their values.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n] is the first value from case['params'], [x] is the second value from case['params'], [y] is the third value from case['params'], and [a] is the array from case['array'])**
