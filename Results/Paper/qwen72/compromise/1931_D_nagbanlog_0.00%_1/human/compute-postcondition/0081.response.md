To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples.
   - `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is 0.
   - `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
   - `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
   - `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
   - `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least three elements.
   - `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0 unless `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` is set to `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.
   - `num` is the third element in `a`.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, we need to look at the second tuple in `test_cases` to get the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.
   - Let's assume the second tuple in `test_cases` is `{'params': [n_value, x_value, y_value], 'array': [a1, a2, a3, ...]}`.
   - `num` is the third element in `a`, so `num = a3`.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x_value`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y_value`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x_value - mod_x) % x_value`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

3. **Construct the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` in the specified format.

Let's assume the second tuple in `test_cases` is `{'params': [10, 3, 4], 'array': [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]}` for concreteness.

- `num` is the third element in `a`, so `num = 7`.
- `mod_x` is `7 % 3 = 1`.
- `mod_y` is `7 % 4 = 3`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(3 - 1) % 3 = 2`.
- `required_mod_y` is `3`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Number: 7, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 3, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 3**
