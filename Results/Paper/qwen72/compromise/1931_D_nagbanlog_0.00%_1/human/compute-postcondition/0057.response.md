To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples.
   - `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is 0.
   - `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
   - `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
   - `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
   - `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `num` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer it from the context. Since `mod_x` and `mod_y` are derived from `num`, and `num` is not directly provided, we can assume `num` is an element from the array `a`.
   - Let's assume `num` is the first element of `a` for simplicity.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `case` is `{'params': (5, 3, 2), 'array': [7, 8, 9]}`.
   - Then `n` is 5, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, and `a` is `[7, 8, 9]`.
   - Let `num` be the first element of `a`, which is 7.
   - `mod_x` is `7 % 3 = 1`.
   - `mod_y` is `7 % 2 = 1`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(3 - 1) % 3 = 2 % 3 = 2`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` based on the example calculation.
   - Therefore, the output will be:
     ```
     Number: 7, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 1, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 1
     ```

Output: **Number: 7, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 1, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 1 (where num is the first element of the array `a` from the second tuple in `test_cases`, and `x` and `y` are the second and third values from `case['params']` respectively)**
