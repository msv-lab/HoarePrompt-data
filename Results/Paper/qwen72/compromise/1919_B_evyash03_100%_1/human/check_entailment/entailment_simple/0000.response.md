Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` (derived from the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program should aim to minimize the total penalty across all subarrays.

However, the function `func_1` in the program calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `expression`, and then returns the absolute value of this difference. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

Let's break down why this is incorrect:

1. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is defined as \( p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_m| \cdot m \). The program does not calculate this penalty for any subarray. Instead, it calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the penalty.

2. **Optimal Splitting**: The program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays. It simply calculates a value based on the entire array and returns it. The optimal splitting is crucial to minimizing the penalty, and the program does not address this at all.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `+`, the program returns `1`, which is correct because the only way to split `[1]` is into `[1]`, and the penalty is \( |1| \cdot 1 = 1 \).
   - For the input `-----`, the program returns `5`, which is correct because the only way to split `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]` is into `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, and the penalty is \( |5 \cdot -1| \cdot 5 = 5 \).
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the program returns `0`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum penalty is `0` by splitting the array into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, but the program does not perform this splitting.
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the program returns `4`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of \( |2 \cdot -1| \cdot 2 + |4 \cdot 1 - 1| \cdot 6 = 4 + 0 = 4 \), but the program does not consider such splits.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement the required splitting logic and penalty calculation.

Correctness: **False**
