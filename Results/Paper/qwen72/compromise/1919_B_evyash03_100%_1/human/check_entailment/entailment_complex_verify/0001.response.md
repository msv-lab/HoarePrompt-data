Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to split the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
   - The optimal way to minimize the total penalty is to pair `+` and `-` characters as much as possible, creating subarrays with a sum of zero. Any remaining unpaired characters will form subarrays of length 1, contributing a penalty equal to their value (1 or -1).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with `expression` and `length` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression` and stores it in `count`.
   - It calculates the number of `-` characters as `sub = length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns `abs(sub - count)`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string.
   - It returns the absolute value of this difference.
   - This approach does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the total penalty as described in the problem. Instead, it calculates the difference between the counts of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the total penalty, we need to pair `+` and `-` characters as much as possible.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is equal, the total penalty can be zero.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is not equal, the minimum penalty is achieved by splitting the array into subarrays of length 1 for the excess characters.
   - The correct minimum penalty is the number of unpaired characters, which is `abs(count - (length - count))`.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `+`, the array is `[1]`. The penalty is `1` (correct).
   - For the input `-----`, the array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`. The penalty is `5` (correct).
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the array is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`. The penalty is `0` (correct).
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the array is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`. The penalty is `4` (correct).
   - For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the array is `[1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`. The penalty is `4` (correct).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the total penalty as described in the problem.
   - The program simply calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.
   - The correct minimum penalty should be the number of unpaired characters, which is `abs(count - (length - count))`.

Final: **False**
