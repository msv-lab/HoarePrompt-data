The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, and `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000 and `length` equals the length of `expression`. The function returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`, where `sub` is equal to `length - count` and `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` containing only '+' and '-' characters, and an integer `length` that matches the length of `expression`. It returns the absolute value of the difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters in `expression`.**
