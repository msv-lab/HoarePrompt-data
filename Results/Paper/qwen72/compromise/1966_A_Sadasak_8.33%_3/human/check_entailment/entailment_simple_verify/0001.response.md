### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `k > n`, it prints `n` because you cannot perform any operations (since you need at least `k` cards to perform an operation). This is correct.
   - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one operation to exchange all `k` cards for `k - 1` new cards, leaving you with `k - 1` cards. This is also correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to create a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It iterates through the list `arr` and updates the frequency of each number.
   - If the frequency of a number exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k` (this is to ensure that the frequency table only contains counts up to `k`). This is correct and helps in simplifying the problem by focusing on the maximum possible group size for each number.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program checks if any value in the frequency table is exactly `k`.
   - If a value is `k`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one operation to reduce the number of cards by 1. This is correct for the specific case where a single group of `k` cards can be reduced.
   - If no value is `k`, it prints `n` (this is incorrect). The program should consider the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing operations on groups of cards with frequencies of at least `k`.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of cards can be reduced further even if no single number has a frequency of exactly `k`.
- The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed. It should consider the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing operations on groups of cards with frequencies of at least `k`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, the program should:
  - Calculate the frequency of each card number.
  - Determine the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing operations on groups of cards with frequencies of at least `k`.
  - The minimum number of cards left can be calculated by repeatedly performing the operation until no more groups of `k` cards with the same number are available.

### Correctness:
- The provided program does not correctly handle the reduction of cards in all cases, especially when multiple operations can be performed on different groups of cards.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program needs to be revised to correctly handle the reduction of cards in all possible scenarios.

Final: **False**
