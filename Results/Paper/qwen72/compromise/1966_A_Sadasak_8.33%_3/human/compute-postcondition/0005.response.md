Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns a dictionary `frequency_table`. Each key in `frequency_table` is an integer from `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, but capped at `k`. The original list `arr` and the integer `k` remain unchanged. **
