Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, and the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The list `N` and the value of `num` remain unchanged.
