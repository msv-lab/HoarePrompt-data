Postcondition: ***`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[num]` is 1, and if `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` â‰¤ `cur`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.***
