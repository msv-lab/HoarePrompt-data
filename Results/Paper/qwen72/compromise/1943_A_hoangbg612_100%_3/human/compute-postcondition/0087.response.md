Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance, `_` is `_ + len(N)` and must be less than `T`, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1.**

Natural language description:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range.
- The variable `T` remains an input integer within the specified range and must be greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the specified range.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is within the specified range.
- The variable `S` remains an input integer.
- The list `N` remains a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- The variable `cur` is updated to the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution. This means `cur` will be the largest integer in `N` that is consecutive to the previous integers processed.
- The dictionary `M` will contain keys for each integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution. The value for each key will be the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance.
- The variable `_` is incremented by the length of `N` and must still be less than `T`.
- The list `cnt` will contain all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, meaning it will list all unique integers from `N` that were not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of their appearance and did not repeat.
