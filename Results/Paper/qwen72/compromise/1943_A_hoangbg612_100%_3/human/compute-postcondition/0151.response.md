Postcondition: ***`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys (one of which is `cur`), and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` contains the key `cur` and the value `k` appended to it. If `M[cur]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the key `cur` and the value `k` appended to it. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list.***
