Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`. If the sum of the values in `M` (i.e., the counts of the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1`) is equal to `S`, then `cur` is updated to be the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 2`, and `M` is updated to include the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 2` with their respective counts. `cnt` is an empty list.**
