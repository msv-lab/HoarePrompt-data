Postcondition: ***`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element in `N`. If `num` > `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to `num`, `M[num]` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` â‰¤ `cur + 1`, `cur` remains unchanged, and `M[cur]` is increased by 1.***
