Postcondition: ***`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys (one of which is `cur`), `k` is the next key in the iteration, and `cnt` remains as defined in the previous state. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` now includes `k` in its list.***
