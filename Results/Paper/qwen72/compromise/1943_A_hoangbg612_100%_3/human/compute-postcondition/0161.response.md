The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The constraints are as follows: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Given this information, the functionality of the function can be described as:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a result for each test case.**
