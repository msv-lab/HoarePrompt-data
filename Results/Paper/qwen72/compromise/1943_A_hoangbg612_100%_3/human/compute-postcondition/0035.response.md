Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends. The sum of the values in `M` equals `S`.**
