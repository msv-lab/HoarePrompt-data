Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1 (which is an empty list since `M` is empty), `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to the first element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `cur` remains -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `M[-1]` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`, `num` is the second element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to the second element in `N`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value. If `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `cur` remains -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `M[-1]` is 1. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `cur` remains -1, and `M` is an empty dictionary. If `num` > `cur` and `num` ≤ `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to the second element in `N`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 2 as its value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
