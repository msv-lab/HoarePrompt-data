Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element in `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[num]` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

In this state, `N` remains a sorted list of integers with at least one element. The variable `num` is still the second element in `N`, but `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`. The dictionary `M` now has a key `num` with a value of 1. The program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
