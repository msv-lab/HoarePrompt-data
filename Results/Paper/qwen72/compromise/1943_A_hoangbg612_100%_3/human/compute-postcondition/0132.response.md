The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `N`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the previous iteration, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, and `num` is the second element in `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `N` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` should be the third element in `N`.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`**
