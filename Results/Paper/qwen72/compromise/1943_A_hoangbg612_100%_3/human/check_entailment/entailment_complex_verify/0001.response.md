### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is a good approach because it allows us to process the elements in a non-decreasing order, which is useful for determining the MEX.

3. **Tracking Elements**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the elements that have been added to the array `c` and their counts.
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX value being considered.

4. **Processing Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` based on the elements.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop, indicating that the current MEX is `cur + 1`.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - The program then creates a list `cnt` of elements in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - The key to determining the MEX is to ensure that the smallest possible integers are included in `c` as much as possible.
  - The program's logic seems to focus on ensuring that the smallest integers are included in `c` and then determining the MEX based on the counts of these integers.

- **Issues**:
  - The program's logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1` and the subsequent break statement is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal play of both players.
  - The final MEX calculation should be based on the smallest integer that is not in `c`, not on the counts of elements in `M`.
  - The condition `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` and the subsequent increment of `cur` by 1 is also incorrect. This condition does not accurately reflect the optimal play strategy.

### Correct Approach:

- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - Alice and Bob will play optimally, so Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will try to exclude the smallest possible integer that Alice could include to minimize the MEX.
  - The MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that is not included in `c` after all elements are processed.

- **Correct Logic**:
  - Sort the array `N`.
  - Use a set to keep track of the elements that have been added to `c`.
  - Iterate through the sorted array and add elements to the set.
  - The MEX is the smallest integer that is not in the set.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and the MEX calculation. The logic for determining the MEX is flawed, and the final MEX calculation does not accurately reflect the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
