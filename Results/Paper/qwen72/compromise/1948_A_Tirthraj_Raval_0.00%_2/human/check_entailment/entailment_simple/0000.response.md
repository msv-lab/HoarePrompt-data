### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Odd `n` Handling:**
   - The function checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2 == 1`.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., "AA", "BB"), and an odd number of such pairs cannot be formed.

3. **Even `n` Handling:**
   - If `n` is even, the function prints "YES".
   - It then constructs a pattern of 'A' and 'B' characters to ensure that there are exactly `n` special characters.
   - The pattern is generated by appending 'A' and 'B' alternately to the list `pattern` for `n // 2` times.
   - This ensures that each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A', creating pairs of special characters.

4. **Pattern Construction:**
   - The pattern is constructed using the expression `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` and `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])`.
   - This effectively alternates between 'A' and 'B' and ensures that each character is special by being equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The final pattern is joined into a string and printed.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The function ensures that the output string length is at most 200, which is within the problem constraints.
   - The function correctly handles both even and odd `n` values and prints the appropriate output for each case.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters for even `n` and correctly reports "NO" for odd `n`. The pattern construction ensures that the string meets the problem requirements, and the output is valid for all test cases within the given constraints.
