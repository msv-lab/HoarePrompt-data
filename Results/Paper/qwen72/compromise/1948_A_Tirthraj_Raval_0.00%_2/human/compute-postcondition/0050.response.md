The code snippet `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` appends a new element to the list `pattern`. The new element is determined by the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. 

- `i` is 2.
- `i % 2` is 0 (since 2 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0).
- `0 ^ 1` is 1 (the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and 1 results in 1).
- `'AB'[1]` is 'B'.

Therefore, 'B' is appended to the list `pattern`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 5, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B'], `i` is 2**.
