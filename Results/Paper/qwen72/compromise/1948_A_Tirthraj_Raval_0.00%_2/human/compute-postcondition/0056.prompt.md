You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, and for each even `n` input, `pattern` is a list of 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`. For each odd `n` input, `n` remains an odd integer and no `pattern` is generated.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and returns a string of uppercase Latin letters containing exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and the string length is at most 200. If no such string can be generated, it returns "NO".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
