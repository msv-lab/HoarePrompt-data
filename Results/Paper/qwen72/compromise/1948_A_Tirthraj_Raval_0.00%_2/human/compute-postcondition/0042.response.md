The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute based on the value of `n // 2`. For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than 0. This means `n` must be at least 2 (since `n // 2` for `n = 1` would be 0, and the loop would not execute).

Given that `t` is greater than 1 and `_` is 1, these variables are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted. The variable `pattern` is an empty list, which is also not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
