Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list of 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
- **`_`**: This variable also remains unchanged and is still 1.
- **`n`**: The input integer `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. The loop will run `n // 2` times, so `n` must be at least 2.
- **`pattern`**: The `pattern` list will contain 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times. For example, if `n` is 6, `pattern` will be `['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B']`.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n // 2 - 1`, which is the last index of the loop range. For example, if `n` is 6, `i` will be 2 after the loop finishes.
