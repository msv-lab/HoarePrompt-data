Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, and for each even `n` input, `pattern` is a list of 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`. For each odd `n` input, `n` remains an odd integer and no `pattern` is generated.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` is 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process.
- The variable `_` is `t - 1`, which means it has iterated through all the test cases.
- For each even `n` input, the function has printed "YES" followed by a string of 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times.
- For each odd `n` input, the function has printed "NO" and no `pattern` is generated.
- The variable `i` is `n // 2 - 1` for each even `n` input, which is the last index used in the inner loop to generate the pattern.
- The variable `n` remains an odd integer for each odd input, and no `pattern` is generated for these cases.
