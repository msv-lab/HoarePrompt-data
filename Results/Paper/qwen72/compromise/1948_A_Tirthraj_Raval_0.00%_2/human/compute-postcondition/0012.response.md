Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than 2, `pattern` is a list containing the strings 'A', 'B', and 'B', `i` is 1**

The code `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends the character at index `i % 2` of the string 'AB' to the list `pattern`. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2` is 1, and the character at index 1 of 'AB' is 'B'. Therefore, 'B' is appended to `pattern`, which initially contains 'A' and 'B'. The other variables remain unchanged.
