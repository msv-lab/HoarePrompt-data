Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at different frequencies, `a` and `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes using the formula `A = int(m / a) + 1`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes using the formula `B = int(m / b) + 1`.
   - It prints the sum of `A` and `B`.

3. **Correctness of the Formulas**:
   - The formula `A = int(m / a) + 1` calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes.
     - `int(m / a)` gives the number of complete intervals of `a` minutes within `m` minutes.
     - Adding 1 accounts for the initial launch at time 0.
   - The formula `B = int(m / b) + 1` does the same for the second installation.

4. **Simultaneous Visibility**:
   - The program assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility period.
   - However, this assumption is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap in visibility times of fireworks launched by both installations.
   - For example, if `a` and `b` are such that their firing times coincide or overlap within the visibility period, the sum `A + B` will overcount the number of fireworks visible at the same time.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlap of visibility periods.
   - The correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - We also need to consider the visibility period of each firework and how they overlap.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly handle the overlap of visibility periods.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
