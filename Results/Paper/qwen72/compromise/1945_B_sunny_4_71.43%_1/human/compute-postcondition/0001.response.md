The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The value of `_` is not relevant to the loop's execution, but it is initialized as part of the loop's structure.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given condition (1 <= t <= 10^4). Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is needed. The variable `_` is not a state that needs to be adjusted, as it is a temporary variable used in the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is initialized for each iteration**
