Functionality: ** The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers). It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing the second value from a recursive call, a calculated value based on the first and second values from the recursive call, and the third value from the recursive call. The purpose of the function is to compute values related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. After the function concludes, the final state includes the returned tuple, which contains the gcd and the coefficients. **
