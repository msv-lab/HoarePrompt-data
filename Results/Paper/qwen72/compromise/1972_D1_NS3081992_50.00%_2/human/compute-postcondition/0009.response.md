Functionality: ** The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it returns the minimum value from recursive calls to `func_12` for elements in `d[da]` where the corresponding `processing` value was initially 0, plus 1. Additionally, the function updates the `rank` list such that `rank[da - 1]` is set to the return value of the function minus 1. The `d` dictionary and `da` integer remain unchanged, while the `processing` list may have elements temporarily set to 1 during the function's execution but are reset to 0 by the end. **
