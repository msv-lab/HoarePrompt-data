Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the transformation of array elements. Specifically, the program only performs the split operation once if it finds an element that is greater than the next element and is greater than 10. This approach is insufficient because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to split an element into its digits and insert them back into the list
    def split_element(lst, index):
        a = lst[index]
        lst.pop(index)
        if a >= 10:
            lst.insert(index, a // 10)
            lst.insert(index + 1, a % 10)
    
    # Function to check if the list can be sorted by splitting elements
    def can_be_sorted(lst):
        while True:
            sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
            if lst == sorted_lst:
                return True
            for p in range(1, len(lst)):
                if lst[p - 1] > lst[p] and lst[p - 1] >= 10:
                    split_element(lst, p - 1)
                    break
            else:
                return False
    
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation:
1. **split_element(lst, index)**: This function takes an element at the given index, splits it into its digits, and inserts those digits back into the list at the same position.
2. **can_be_sorted(lst)**: This function repeatedly checks if the list is sorted. If not, it looks for elements that are greater than the next element and are at least 10, and splits them. If no such elements are found and the list is still not sorted, it returns `False`. If the list becomes sorted at any point, it returns `True`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles multiple splits and checks the sorted condition after each split operation.
