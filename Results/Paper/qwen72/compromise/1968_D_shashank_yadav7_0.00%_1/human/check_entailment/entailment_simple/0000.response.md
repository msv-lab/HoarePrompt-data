### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each. This is necessary because Python lists are 0-indexed.

3. **Initial Score Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, where `b` and `s` are the 0-indexed starting positions.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns. However, the loop iterates `n` times, which is incorrect. The loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times.
   - Inside the loop, the program updates the positions `b` and `s` based on the permutation `p`.
   - The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated in a way that seems to be trying to maximize the score, but the logic is flawed. The correct approach should be to simply add the score at the current position and then move to the next position as per the permutation.

5. **Score Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores `bm` and `sm` and prints the winner or "Draw" accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Loop Iteration:**
  - The loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times. The current loop iterates `n` times, which is incorrect and will lead to incorrect results.
- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation logic is incorrect. The program should simply add the score at the current position and then move to the next position as per the permutation. The current logic with `max` and `k` is not necessary and is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        
        for j in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program remains as provided.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
