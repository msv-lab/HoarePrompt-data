### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indices, which is appropriate for Python lists.

3. **Initialization of Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct as the score increases by the value at the current position in the array `a`.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively. This is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-based, and the positions should be updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` without further adjustment.
   - The scores are updated by adding the value at the new position in the array `a`.

5. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using a loop that iterates `k` times.
   - However, the score calculation logic is flawed. The program uses `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, which does not make sense in the context of the game. The correct way to calculate the score is to simply add the value at the current position to the total score for each turn.

6. **Output:**
   - After the simulation, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

### Correctness:
The program contains a logical error in the score calculation and position updating. The correct way to simulate the game is to update the positions and scores for each turn without using the `max` function in the way it is currently used. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
