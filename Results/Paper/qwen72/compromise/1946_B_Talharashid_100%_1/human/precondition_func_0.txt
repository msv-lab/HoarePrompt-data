The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_sum_after_operations(t, n, k, a):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers representing the length of the array `a` and the number of operations, respectively (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
