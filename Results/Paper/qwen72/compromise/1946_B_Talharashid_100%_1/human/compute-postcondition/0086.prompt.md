You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_sum_after_operations(t, n, k, a):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers representing the length of the array `a` and the number of operations, respectively (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = 0
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
        
    #State: `int(input())` is 0, `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space for the last test case, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space for the last test case, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements in `l` that are contiguous and not immediately followed by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns the maximum possible sum of the array `a` after performing `k` operations, where each operation consists of incrementing any element of the array by 1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
