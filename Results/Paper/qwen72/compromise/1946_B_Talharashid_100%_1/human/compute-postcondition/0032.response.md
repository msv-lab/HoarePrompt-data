Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.**

The value of `maxi` is explicitly set to 0, and all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
