Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0.** 

If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c + ele` and 0.
