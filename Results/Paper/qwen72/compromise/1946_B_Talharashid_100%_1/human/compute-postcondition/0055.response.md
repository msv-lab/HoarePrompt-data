Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space.
4. `l` is a list of integers from a new input split by a space.
5. `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` that are contiguous.
6. `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The first input is an integer greater than 0, but it is not used in the code snippet.
   - The second input is split into two integers, `n` and `k`.
   - The third input is a list of integers, `l`.

2. **Sum of Non-Negative Contiguous Elements:**
   - `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` that are contiguous. This means we need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of non-negative elements in `l`.

3. **Update `maxi`:**
   - `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the current `c`. Since `maxi` is initially not defined, it will be set to the first value of `c` and then updated if subsequent `c` values are larger.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is evaluated.
   - `2 ** k` is the power of 2 raised to the integer `k`.
   - `2 ** k * maxi` multiplies this power by the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements.
   - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` subtracts `maxi` from the product.
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - The final result is taken modulo 1000000007 to ensure it fits within a certain range.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `n` and `k` from the second input: `n = 5` and `k = 3`.
- `l` from the third input: `l = [1, 2, -3, 4, 5]`.

1. **Sum of Non-Negative Contiguous Elements:**
   - The contiguous non-negative subarrays are `[1, 2]` and `[4, 5]`.
   - The sums of these subarrays are `3` and `9`.
   - Therefore, `c` will be `9` (the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements).

2. **Update `maxi`:**
   - `maxi` is set to `9`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - `2 ** k` is `2 ** 3` which is `8`.
   - `2 ** k * maxi` is `8 * 9` which is `72`.
   - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` is `72 - 9` which is `63`.
   - `sum(l)` is `1 + 2 - 3 + 4 + 5` which is `9`.
   - The final expression is `(63 + 9) % 1000000007` which is `72 % 1000000007` which is `72`.

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where `k` is the second integer from the input, `maxi` is the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l`, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`)**
