The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, and the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the loop can execute at least once, so `int(input())` must be at least 1.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
