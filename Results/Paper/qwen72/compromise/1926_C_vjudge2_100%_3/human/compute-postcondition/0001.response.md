The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `a`, but the condition for the loop to execute is solely dependent on `num`. The loop will execute if `num` is not equal to 0. Given that `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, it is already ensured that `num` is not 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
