Output State: **`k`, `a`, and `n` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9 and 0 <= k <= min(n, b); `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `k * b + (n - k) * a`.
- The values of `k`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `k`, `a`, and `n` are non-negative integers within the specified ranges is still valid.
