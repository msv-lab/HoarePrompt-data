Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from user input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a` and at least 1, `i` is 3, `x` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - 3 \times 2}{3^2} \right\rfloor + 1\), `suma` is increased by \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - 3 \times 2}{3^2} \right\rfloor + 2\).**
