Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is the input integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `info` is a list of strings from user input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]` from the last iteration, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` from the last iteration and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the last iteration, where `x` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`, and `suma` is incremented by 1 for each `i` where \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1 > 0\).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop has completed all `T` iterations.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- The variable `T` is the input integer that determined the number of iterations.
- The variable `t` is `T - 1`, indicating the loop has run `T` times.
- The variable `info` is the list of strings from the last user input.
- The variable `a` is the integer value of the first element of `info` from the last iteration.
- The variable `b` is the integer value of the second element of `info` from the last iteration and must be greater than or equal to `a`.
- The variable `i` is `b + 1`, indicating the inner loop has completed all its iterations for the last `b`.
- The variable `suma` is the final sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the last iteration of the loop, where `x` is computed as \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`, and `suma` is incremented by 1 for each `i` that meets the specific conditions.
