Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `suma` is 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `info` is a list of strings from the new input.**

The code snippet sets `suma` to 0, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
