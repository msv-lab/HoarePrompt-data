The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `b + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `b` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `b` must still be greater than or equal to `i` (which is now 3).

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a` and 2, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\). If \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), then `suma` is \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 2\) if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \((i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\). Otherwise, `suma` remains \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\). If \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 \leq 0\), `suma` remains \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\).**
