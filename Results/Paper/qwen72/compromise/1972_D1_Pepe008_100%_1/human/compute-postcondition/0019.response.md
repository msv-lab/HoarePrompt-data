The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `suma` is 0, `i` is 3, and `x` is the result of the expression `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`**
