Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a` and 1, `suma` is `x`, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a + 1) // 1`, and the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`.
- `x` is calculated as `(a + 1) // 1`, which simplifies to `a + 1` since integer division by 1 does not change the value.
- Therefore, `suma` becomes `a + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
