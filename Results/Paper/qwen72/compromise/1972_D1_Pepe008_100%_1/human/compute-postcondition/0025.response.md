Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `b`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values and additional 1s for each valid `i` that meets the specific conditions, `i` is `b + 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `m`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The variable `a` remains the same as the integer value of `info[0]`.
- The variable `b` remains the same as the integer value of `info[1]`, but it must be greater than or equal to `b` for the loop to execute `b` times.
- The variable `suma` is the sum of all `x` values that are greater than 0, plus an additional 1 for each `i` that meets the specific conditions: `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`.
- The loop variable `i` will be `b + 1` after all iterations have completed, as the loop runs from `1` to `b` inclusive.
