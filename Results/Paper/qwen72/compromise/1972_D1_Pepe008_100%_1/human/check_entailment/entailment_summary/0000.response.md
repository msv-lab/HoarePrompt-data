Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Formula and Logic**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The formula used in the program is:
     ```python
     x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
     ```
     This formula is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b` (or `i` in the loop). However, this formula does not directly correspond to the problem's requirement.
   - The program then checks if the result of the formula is greater than 0 and adds it to `suma`.
   - Additionally, it checks if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, and if so, it increments `suma` by 1. This additional check seems to be an attempt to handle edge cases, but it is not clear how it relates to the problem's conditions.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case. The subtraction of 2 is not explained in the problem description and appears to be an arbitrary adjustment that may not be correct.

4. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not derived from the problem's conditions. The correct approach would be to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` directly.
   - The correct condition to check is:
     ```python
     if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
     ```
     This condition should be used to determine if a pair `(a, b)` is valid.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program's current approach is inefficient. It iterates over all possible values of `b` up to `b + 1`, which can be very slow for large values of `b` (up to `2 * 10^6`).

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The formula used is incorrect, and the final result is adjusted arbitrarily without a clear explanation.

Correctness: **False**
