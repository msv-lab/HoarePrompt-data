Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1` or the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, `k` is `k - n` or `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times or until `k` reaches 0), `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times or until `k` reaches 0), `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each `b` and `k` during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each `s` and `k` during the loop, `sp` is increased by the sum of `a[s]` for each `s` during the loop, `bp` is increased by the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop, and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.***
