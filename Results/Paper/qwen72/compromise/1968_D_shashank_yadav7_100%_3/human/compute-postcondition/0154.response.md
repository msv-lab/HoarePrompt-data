Output State: **`i` is `t-1`, `n` is the initial value of `n`, `t` is the initial value of `t`, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations (or -1 if the loop breaks early), `b` is the final position of `b` after all iterations (or the position when `k` reaches 0), `s` is the final position of `s` after all iterations (or the position when `k` reaches 0), `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each `s` during the loop, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop breaks and `bm` and `sm` are set to -1. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- The initial values of `n`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is reduced by the number of iterations the inner loop completes, or it becomes -1 if the inner loop breaks early when `k` reaches 0.
- The positions `b` and `s` are updated based on the permutation `p` and the number of iterations, or they stop updating when `k` reaches 0.
- `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, respectively.
- `sp` is the sum of the values of `a[s]` for each `s` during the loop, and `bp` is the sum of the values of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop.
- If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop breaks, and `bm` and `sm` are set to -1.
- The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` determines whether `Bodya` wins, `Sasha` wins, or it's a `Draw`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `Bodya` wins. If `bm` is less than `sm`, `Sasha` wins. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, it's a `Draw`.
