Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -3 or decreased by 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged or are still described by their initial conditions.
- The initial state mentions that `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, which is exactly what the code snippet does. Therefore, this update is included in the output state.
