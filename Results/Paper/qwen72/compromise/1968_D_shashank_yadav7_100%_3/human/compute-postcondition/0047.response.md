Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is `n-1` (or `n` if the loop breaks early).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is `k - n` (or `k - i` if the loop breaks early).
- `b` is the result of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`).
- `s` is the result of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`).
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[s] - 1` for `i` iterations.
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[b] - 1` for `i` iterations.
- `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations.
- If `k` reaches 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the loop breaks.
- Additionally, `bm` is less than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Sasha')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'Sasha'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the string `'Sasha'`.

### Conclusion:
The code snippet will print the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
