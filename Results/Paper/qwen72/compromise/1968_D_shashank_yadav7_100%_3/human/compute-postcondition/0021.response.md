Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[p[b] - 1]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are both set to -1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bp` is updated to `a[b] + a[p[b] - 1]`.
- The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged except for the update to `bp`.
- If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, this condition is not directly affected by the given code snippet, so it remains as part of the initial state.
