Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[s] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[b] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the loop breaks. Additionally, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. This changes the value of `p` from an unspecified list of integers to a list of integers provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
