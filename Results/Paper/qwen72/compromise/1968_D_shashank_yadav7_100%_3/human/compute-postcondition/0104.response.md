The provided code snippet reads four integer values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` respectively. The initial state includes specific conditions for these variables, but the new values from the input will override the initial conditions.

Output State: **`i` is `n` (the new value of `n` from input), `t` must be greater than `n` (the new value of `n` from input), `k` is the new value of `k` from input, `b` is the new value of `b` from input, `s` is the new value of `s` from input, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each `b` and `k` during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each `s` and `k` during the loop, `sp` is increased by the sum of `a[s]` for each `s` during the loop, `bp` is increased by the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop, and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.**
