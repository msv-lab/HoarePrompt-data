Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` multiplied by `k` minus 1, `sm` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` multiplied by `k` minus 1. If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are both set to -1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
