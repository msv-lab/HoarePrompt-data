### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, which is correct.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively, which is incorrect as it assumes the player will stay at the same position for all `k` turns, which is not always the case.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The function iterates `n` times, which is incorrect. It should iterate `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p` using `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`. This is incorrect because `p` is already 0-based indexed, so the correct update should be `b = p[b]` and `s = p[s]`.
   - It updates the scores `bp` and `sp` by adding the corresponding values from `a`, which is correct.
   - It also updates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` by considering the current score and the remaining turns. The logic `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is flawed because it does not accurately represent the game rules. The maximum score should be the sum of the scores accumulated over the turns, not a combination of the current score and the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After the simulation, the function compares the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm`.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, it's a draw.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times. The correct loop should be `for _ in range(k)`.

2. **Incorrect Position Update**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect because `p` is already 0-based indexed. The correct update should be `b = p[b]` and `s = p[s]`.

3. **Incorrect Update of Maximum Scores**:
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are updated incorrectly. The logic `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` does not accurately reflect the game rules. The maximum score should be the sum of the scores accumulated over the turns, not a combination of the current score and the remaining turns.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The loop runs exactly `k` times to simulate the game.
- The positions are updated correctly using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, but this should be `p[b]` and `p[s]` if `p` is 0-based indexed.
- The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated by adding the corresponding values from `a` for each turn.
- After the loop, the scores are compared to determine the winner.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program has significant logical errors in the way it updates the scores and positions, leading to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output.

Final: **False**
