Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` by multiplying the current score by `k` and then adding the current position's score. This approach does not correctly simulate the game's rules, where the score is simply incremented by the value at the current position in the array `a` on each turn.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the game lasts for `k` turns. The loop that simulates the game only runs for `k-1` iterations, which can lead to incorrect results if the game is supposed to last exactly `k` turns.

Here's a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Draw
```

In this example, Bodya starts at position 3 and Sasha starts at position 2. The permutation `p` is `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and the array `a` is `[7, 2, 5, 6]`. The game lasts for 2 turns.

**Correct Simulation:**
- **Turn 1:**
  - Bodya's position: 3, score: 0 + 5 = 5, move to 2 (since `p[3] = 2`)
  - Sasha's position: 2, score: 0 + 2 = 2, move to 1 (since `p[2] = 1`)
- **Turn 2:**
  - Bodya's position: 2, score: 5 + 2 = 7, move to 1 (since `p[2] = 1`)
  - Sasha's position: 1, score: 2 + 7 = 9, stay at 1

After 2 turns, Bodya's score is 7 and Sasha's score is 9, so Sasha should win. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" because of the flawed score calculation logic.
