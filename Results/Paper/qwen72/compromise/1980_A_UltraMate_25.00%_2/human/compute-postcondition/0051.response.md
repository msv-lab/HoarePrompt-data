Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s` and must have at least one key, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
