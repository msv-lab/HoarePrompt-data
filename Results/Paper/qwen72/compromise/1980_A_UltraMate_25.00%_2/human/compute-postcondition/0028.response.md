Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least three keys, `i` is the third key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not a key in `hmp` plus `2 * (m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not a key in `hmp`.***
