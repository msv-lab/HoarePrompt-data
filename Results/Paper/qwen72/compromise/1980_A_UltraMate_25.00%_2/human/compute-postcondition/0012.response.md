The value of `ans` is incremented by `m`. Since the initial state specifies that if `i` (which is 'B') is not a key in the `hmp` Counter object, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. After the execution of the given code snippet, `ans` will be incremented by `m` regardless of its initial value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `ans` is `ans` + `m`.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `ans` is `ans` + `m`.**
