Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `s` is the new input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the new input string `s`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`, which is 'ABCDEF'.
- For each character `i` in `p`, the loop checks if `i` is not in the `hmp` (Counter object).
- If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
