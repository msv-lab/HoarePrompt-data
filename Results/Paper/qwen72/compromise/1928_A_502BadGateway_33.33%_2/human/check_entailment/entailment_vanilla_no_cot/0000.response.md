Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if the side `b` of the rectangle is even. However, the problem requires determining if Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one by cutting and rearranging the pieces. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed because it does not consider all possible scenarios for forming a new rectangle.

### Explanation:
1. **Cutting the Rectangle**: Bob can cut the rectangle along either side `a` or `b`. If he cuts along side `a`, the resulting pieces will have dimensions `a/2` by `b` (assuming `a` is even). If he cuts along side `b`, the resulting pieces will have dimensions `a` by `b/2` (assuming `b` is even).

2. **Forming a New Rectangle**: To form a new rectangle, Bob needs to be able to rearrange the pieces such that the new dimensions are different from the original `a` by `b`. This means:
   - If `a` is even, cutting it into two `a/2` by `b` pieces should allow forming a new rectangle of dimensions `a` by `b/2` (if `b` is even).
   - If `b` is even, cutting it into two `a` by `b/2` pieces should allow forming a new rectangle of dimensions `a/2` by `b` (if `a` is even).

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are 1, no cut can be made, and no new rectangle can be formed.
   - If either `a` or `b` is 1, the only possible cuts will result in smaller rectangles that cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1 and if at least one of them is even. Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if a == 1 and b == 1:
        return 'no'
    if a > 1 and b > 1:
        return 'yes'
    if a == 1:
        return 'no' if b == 1 else 'yes'
    if b == 1:
        return 'no' if a == 1 else 'yes'
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **If both `a` and `b` are 1**: No cut can be made, so the answer is "no".
- **If either `a` or `b` is 1 and the other is greater than 1**: The only possible cut will result in a smaller rectangle that cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle, so the answer is "no" if the other dimension is also 1, otherwise "yes".
- **If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1**: A new rectangle can be formed if at least one of them is even, so the answer is "yes" if `a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`.

This solution correctly handles all the cases described in the problem.
