Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is the last character in `s`.
   - `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - `a` is a set containing all unique characters in `s`.
   - The number of unique characters in `s` is greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, and `a`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **YES**
