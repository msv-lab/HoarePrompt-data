The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop will continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `s`, and `a` is a set containing the first character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in `s`. Since `i` is the first character in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is the second character of `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing the first character of `s`**
