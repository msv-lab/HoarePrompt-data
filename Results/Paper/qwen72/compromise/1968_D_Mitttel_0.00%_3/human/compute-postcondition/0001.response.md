Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`.** 

The initial state specifies that `start_pos` is an integer within the range 1 to `n`, and `score` is 0. The code snippet assigns the value of `start_pos` to `current_pos`, so `current_pos` now holds the same value as `start_pos`. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
