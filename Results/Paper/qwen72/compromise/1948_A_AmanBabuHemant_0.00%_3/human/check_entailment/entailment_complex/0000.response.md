Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over `t` test cases, reading an integer `n` for each case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters if `n` is odd. This is correct because a special character must be part of a pair (either "AA" or "BB" or similar), and an odd number of such pairs cannot be formed.

3. **String Construction**: For even `n`, the function constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "110" `n // 2` times. This is intended to create a string with exactly `n` special characters. However, the pattern "110" does not produce the correct number of special characters. In the pattern "110", only the first two characters are special (since they are equal to one of their neighbors), but the third character is not special. Therefore, the string "110" repeated `n // 2` times will have `2 * (n // 2) = n` special characters, which is correct.

4. **Length Check**: The function checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string. If the length is 200 or more, it prints "NO". This is correct because the problem specifies that the string should be at most 200 characters long.

5. **Output**: The function prints the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

However, there is a critical issue with the string construction. The function uses the pattern "110" to construct the string, but the problem requires the string to be composed of uppercase Latin letters, not digits. Therefore, the string construction is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, the function should use a pattern of uppercase Latin letters, such as "AAB" or "BBA", which will also produce the correct number of special characters. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
```

This corrected version will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
