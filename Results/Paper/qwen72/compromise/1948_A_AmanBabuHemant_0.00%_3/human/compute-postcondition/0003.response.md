Output State: The function will print "NO" for any odd value of `n` and "YES" followed by a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times for any even value of `n` where the length of the string is less than 200. If `n` is even but the length of the string is 200 or more, it will print "NO". The loop will execute `t` times, and the state of `t` will remain unchanged.
