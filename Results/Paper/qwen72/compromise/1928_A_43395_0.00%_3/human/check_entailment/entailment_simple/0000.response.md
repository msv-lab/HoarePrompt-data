### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If they are, it prints 'yes'. This is correct because if both dimensions are even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.
   - The second condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is either `-a` or `-b`. This is incorrect because it does not make logical sense in the context of the problem. The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is not a valid comparison and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The third condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. If it is, it prints 'yes'. This is incorrect because the difference being odd does not necessarily mean that Bob can form another rectangle. For example, a 3x5 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a different rectangle.
   - The final `else` block prints 'no' if none of the above conditions are met. This is incorrect because it does not cover all valid cases where Bob can form another rectangle.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions is even. This is because an even dimension can be cut into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - The correct condition should be:
     - If `a` is even or `b` is even, print 'yes'.
     - Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program contains logical errors in the conditions used to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. Specifically, the second and third conditions are incorrect and do not align with the problem's requirements. The correct condition should be based on whether at least one of the dimensions is even.
