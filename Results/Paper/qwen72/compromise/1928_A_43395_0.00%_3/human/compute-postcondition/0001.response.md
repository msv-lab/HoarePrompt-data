Output State: **The loop will execute for the number of iterations specified by the first input. For each iteration, it will read two integers a and b from the input, and based on the conditions provided, it will print 'yes' or 'no'. The values of a and b will be updated with each iteration, but the initial values of a and b provided as parameters to the function will remain unchanged.**

To clarify, the loop does not modify the initial values of `a` and `b` that are passed as parameters to the function. Instead, it reads new values for `a` and `b` from the input for each iteration and performs the checks. The output will be a series of 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions for each pair of `a` and `b` read during the iterations.
