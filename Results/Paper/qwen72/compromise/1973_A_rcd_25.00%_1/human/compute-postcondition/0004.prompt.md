You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input. The loop will print a value based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be updated for each iteration, but the initial input values `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (which are not used inside the loop) will remain unchanged. After `t` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will end.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a value based on the scores, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
