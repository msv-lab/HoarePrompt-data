The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is the XOR of the 30th bit of `val` and the original `op`, `cnt` is 1 if the original `op` was 0, otherwise `cnt` is 2, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**
