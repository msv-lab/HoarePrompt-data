The value of `ai` is set to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
