The code snippet `t.append(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the end of the list `t`. Given that `ai` is equal to `val`, which is the third element in the list `a`, the list `t` will now contain two elements: the first element of `a` and the third element of `a`.

Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 3 elements, `t` is a list containing the first and third elements of `a`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is `val`, and `val` is the third element in the list `a`.**
