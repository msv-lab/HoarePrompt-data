The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of control within a loop.

Given the initial state:
- `u` is the bit at position 28 in `x`
- `v` is the sum of the bits at position 28 in each element of `a`
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\)
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 28
- `u` is 1
- `v` is odd

Since the `continue` statement only affects the flow of control and does not change any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`u` is 1, `v` is odd, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28.**
