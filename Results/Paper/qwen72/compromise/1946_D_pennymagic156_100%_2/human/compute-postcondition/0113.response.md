Postcondition: ***`u` is the bit at position 28 in `x`, `v` is the sum of the bits at position 28 in each element of `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, and `i` is 28. If `u` is 0, `a` is now an empty list, `t` is the list that previously contained `0` if `op` was 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise `t` is an empty list. `op` is the XOR of the 28th bits of all elements in the original `a`. `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a`. `val` is the last element processed in the loop. If `u` is 1, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `i` is 28, and `ans` is -1. If `v` is odd, the state remains as described. If `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0, `op` is the result of XORing the 29th bit (from the right) of all elements in `a`, and `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0. If `v` is 0, `ans` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
