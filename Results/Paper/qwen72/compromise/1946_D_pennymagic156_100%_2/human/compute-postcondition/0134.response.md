Postcondition: ***`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 2 elements, `t` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is a list containing the second element of `a`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is the 28th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `val`, and `val` is the second element in the list `a`.***
