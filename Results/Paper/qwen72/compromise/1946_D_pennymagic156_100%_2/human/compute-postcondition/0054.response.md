Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is the XOR of the 30th bits of all elements in `a`, and `cnt` is the number of elements in `a` whose 30th bit contributes to making `op` equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `val` in the list `a`.
- For each `val`, the 30th bit (bit at position 29) is extracted using `val >> i & 1` and XORed with `op`.
- If the result of the XOR operation (`op`) is 0, `cnt` is incremented.
- After all iterations, `op` will be the XOR of the 30th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `cnt` will count how many times `op` was 0 during the iterations, which corresponds to the number of elements in `a` whose 30th bit contributed to making `op` equal to 0.
