The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `val` is the first element of the list `a`.
2. `i` is an index (not explicitly defined in the initial state, but assumed to be a valid index for the bitwise shift).
3. `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
4. `val >> i & 1` extracts the least significant bit of the shifted value.
5. `op ^= val >> i & 1` toggles the least significant bit of `op` based on the extracted bit.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
- `val` is the first element of `a`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `val` is the first element of `a`, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`.**
