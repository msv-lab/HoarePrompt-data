The provided code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements.
- The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`.
- `val` is the second element in `a`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

The code snippet `t.append(ai)` only affects the list `t` by appending the value of `ai` to it. The other variables (`a`, `val`, `i`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements. The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`. `val` is the second element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. `t` is a list that now includes the value `ai`.**
