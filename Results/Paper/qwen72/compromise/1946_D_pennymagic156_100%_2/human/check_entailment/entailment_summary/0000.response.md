Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1]`, `[l_2, r_2]`, ..., `[l_k, r_k]` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to a given number `x`.

### Function Breakdown:
1. **func_1**: Reads a space-separated list of integers and returns it as a list. This function is used to read the array `a`.
2. **func_2**: Reads an integer from the input. This function is not used in the provided code.
3. **func_3**: Reads a space-separated list of integers and returns it as an iterator. This function is used to read the values of `n` and `x`.
4. **func_4**: Reads a string from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This function is not used in the provided code.
5. **func_5**: This is the main function that processes the input and computes the required output.

### Analysis of func_5:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `x` using `func_3()` and the array `a` using `func_1()`.
- **Bitwise Processing**: The function iterates over the bits from the 29th bit to the 0th bit.
  - For each bit position `i`, it checks the bit values of `x` and the sum of the bit values in `a`.
  - Depending on these values, it either continues, returns `-1`, or updates the list `t` and the variable `ans`.
- **Conditions**:
  - If the bit `u` in `x` is 0 and the sum of the corresponding bits in `a` is odd, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to form valid segments.
  - If the bit `u` in `x` is 0 and the sum of the corresponding bits in `a` is even, it processes the array to form segments and updates `t`.
  - If the bit `u` in `x` is 1 and the sum of the corresponding bits in `a` is even, it counts the number of valid segments and updates `ans`.
  - If the bit `u` in `x` is 1 and the sum of the corresponding bits in `a` is odd, it continues.
- **Final Output**: The function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`.

### Verification:
- The function correctly handles the bitwise operations and conditions specified in the problem.
- It ensures that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.
- The function returns `-1` when it's impossible to form valid segments, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.
