Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is removed from the list `remaining_vertices`, and `v` is appended to the list `path`. The execution continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is removed from the list `remaining_vertices`.
- The value of `v` is appended to the list `path`.
- The values of `n`, `d`, and `u` remain unchanged.
- The execution continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
