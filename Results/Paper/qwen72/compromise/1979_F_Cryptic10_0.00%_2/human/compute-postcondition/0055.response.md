Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains the vertex `v` (if `v` is not 0 and was in `remaining_vertices`), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any and if `v` was added to `path`) and `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
