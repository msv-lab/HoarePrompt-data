Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current loop iteration is skipped. `path` and `remaining_vertices` are unchanged.**

The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the current loop iteration is skipped due to the `continue` statement.
