Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to the list `path`, and `v` is removed from the list `remaining_vertices`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`.
- If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`.
- The values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged.
- The value of `u` is not affected by this code.
- The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
