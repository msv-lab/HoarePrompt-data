Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, and `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and appended to `path`. If `v` is 0 or `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**
