Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` contains all vertices from 1 to n (inclusive) in some order, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change the values of any variables. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
