The only objects in the loop head are the variable `d` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but given the state before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Therefore, `n` is already within a range that ensures the loop will execute at least once. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, so `d` must start at `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`**
