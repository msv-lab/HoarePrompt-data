Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph after removing \(n - 2\) edges from a complete undirected graph with \(n\) vertices. The solution involves interactively querying the graph to identify vertices and their connections, and then constructing the path.

### Function Analysis:
1. **`func_1(d)`**:
   - This function sends a query to the interactor asking for a vertex with a degree at least `d` and a vertex that is not connected to it.
   - It reads the response from the interactor and returns it as a tuple `(v, u)`.
   - The function is correctly implemented to handle the interaction as specified in the problem.

2. **`func_2(n)`**:
   - This function initializes a list `path` to store the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` to keep track of vertices that have not been removed.
   - It iterates over the set of remaining vertices and for each iteration, it queries the graph with decreasing values of `d` (from \(n-1\) to 0).
   - If the interactor returns a vertex `v` with a degree at least `d` and `v` is in the set of remaining vertices, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The function continues this process until all vertices are added to the path.
   - Finally, it prints the path and flushes the output buffer.

### Correctness Check:
- **Querying Strategy**: The function `func_2` starts with the highest possible degree and decreases it until it finds a vertex `v` that meets the criteria. This ensures that it finds a vertex with the minimum degree that is at least `d`.
- **Handling Responses**: The function correctly handles the response from the interactor. If the interactor returns "0 0", it continues to the next degree. If a valid vertex `v` is found, it adds it to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
- **Path Construction**: The function constructs the path by adding vertices in the order they are found, ensuring that each vertex is added exactly once.
- **Termination**: The function terminates when all vertices are added to the path, and it prints the path as required.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The function should handle edge cases where the graph is very small (e.g., \(n = 2\)). For \(n = 2\), the function will correctly find the path since there is only one edge to remove, and the remaining graph will have a Hamiltonian path.
- **Query Limit**: The function makes at most \(n\) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Graph Properties**: The function assumes that the graph is a complete undirected graph with \(n\) vertices and \(n-2\) edges removed. This is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the solution for finding a Hamiltonian path in the described graph. The strategy of querying with decreasing degrees and handling the responses appropriately ensures that the path is constructed correctly and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
