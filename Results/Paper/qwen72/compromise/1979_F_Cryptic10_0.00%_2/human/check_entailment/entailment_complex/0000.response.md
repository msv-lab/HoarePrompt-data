### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is responsible for making a query to the interactor and receiving the response.
   - It prints a query string in the format `"? d"` and flushes the output buffer to ensure the query is sent immediately.
   - It then reads the response from the interactor, which is expected to be two integers `v` and `u`, and returns them as a tuple.
   - The function correctly handles the interaction with the interactor and follows the specified format for queries and responses.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function constructs a Hamiltonian path in the graph by iteratively querying the interactor.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` to keep track of the vertices that have not been added to the path yet.
   - The function enters a loop that continues until all vertices are added to the path (i.e., `remaining_vertices` is empty).
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - For each degree `d`, it makes a query using `func_1(d)` and receives the response `(v, u)`.
   - If `v` is `0`, it continues to the next degree.
   - If `v` is a valid vertex (i.e., it is in `remaining_vertices`), it adds `v` to the path and removes it from `remaining_vertices`.
   - The loop ensures that the function makes at most `n` queries, as required by the problem constraints.
   - After constructing the path, it prints the path in the required format and flushes the output buffer.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_2(n)`.
   - Each test case is handled independently, and the program ensures that the Hamiltonian path is found and printed for each test case.
   - The program correctly follows the interaction protocol and handles the constraints specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution for finding a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the specified queries. It adheres to the constraints and interaction rules, and the logic for constructing the path is sound.

**Correctness: **True****
