### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges are removed.
   - The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** This function makes a query to the interactor and returns the response as a tuple \((v, u)\).
     - It correctly formats the query and flushes the output buffer.
     - It reads the response and returns it.
   - **Function `func_2`:** This function constructs the Hamiltonian path.
     - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path.
     - It initializes a set `remaining_vertices` with all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
     - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it makes a query using `func_1`.
     - If the returned vertex \( v \) is 0, it continues to the next degree.
     - If \( v \) is a valid vertex (i.e., it is in the set of remaining vertices), it adds \( v \) to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
     - The process continues until all vertices are added to the path.
     - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path and flushes the output buffer.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm ensures that it always selects a vertex \( v \) with the minimum degree among the vertices with a degree at least \( d \).
   - It also ensures that the selected vertex \( v \) is not connected to another vertex \( u \) with the minimum number.
   - By removing \( v \) and its edges, the algorithm guarantees that the next query will consider the updated graph.
   - The algorithm uses at most \( n \) queries, as it will stop once all vertices are added to the path.
   - The Hamiltonian path is constructed by adding vertices one by one, ensuring that each vertex is connected to the next in the path.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( v \) is 0 by continuing to the next degree.
   - It also handles the case where the graph is reduced to a single vertex by ensuring that the set of remaining vertices is empty before the loop ends.

5. **Output and Interaction:**
   - The program correctly flushes the output buffer after each query and after reporting the path.
   - It follows the interaction rules as specified in the problem description.

### Function Summary Validation:
- **Function `func_1`:** The function correctly makes a query and reads the response, returning it as a tuple.
- **Function `func_2`:** The function correctly constructs the Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the interactor and updating the set of remaining vertices. It ensures that all vertices are included in the path and that the path is printed in the correct format.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly constructs a Hamiltonian path using at most \( n \) queries and follows the interaction rules. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the path is valid.

Final: **True**
