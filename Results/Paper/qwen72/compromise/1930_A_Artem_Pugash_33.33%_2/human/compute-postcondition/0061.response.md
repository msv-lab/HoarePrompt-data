Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. It then sorts these integers and calculates the sum of the minimum values of each consecutive pair of integers. Finally, it prints the sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves `numbers` as an empty list and `suma` as the sum of the minimum values for the last test case. **
