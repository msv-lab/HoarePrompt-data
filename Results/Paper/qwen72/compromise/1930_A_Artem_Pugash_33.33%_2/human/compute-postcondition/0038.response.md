Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` until the list is empty.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- **`numCases`**: Must still be greater than 1, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains 1, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`numInteger`**: Remains an input integer, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`numbers`**: Initially a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order, it becomes an empty list after all iterations of the loop because the loop continues to remove elements until the list is empty.
- **`suma`**: Initially 0, it accumulates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` during each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `suma` will be the total sum of these minimum values.
