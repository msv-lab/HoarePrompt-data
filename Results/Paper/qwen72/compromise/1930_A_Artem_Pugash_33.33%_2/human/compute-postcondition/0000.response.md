The code snippet `numCases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. `numCases` is an input integer.**
