The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `numCases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `numCases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `numCases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 1), and `numCases` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list until it is empty.**
