To determine what will be printed by the `print(suma)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `numCases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `numInteger` is an input integer.
   - `numbers` is an empty list.
   - `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list until it is empty.

2. **Understanding `suma`:**
   - `suma` is calculated by repeatedly taking pairs of integers from the `numbers` list and summing the minimum value of each pair.
   - Since `numbers` is initially an empty list, there are no pairs to form, and thus no minimum values to sum.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `numbers` is an empty list, the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from an empty list is 0.

Therefore, the `print(suma)` statement will print the value of `suma`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
