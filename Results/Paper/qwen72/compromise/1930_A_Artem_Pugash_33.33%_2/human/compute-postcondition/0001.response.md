To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `numCases`.

- The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 0.
- The loop will execute if `numCases` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.
- `numCases` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `numCases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
