Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order and contains at least one element (but now has one less element), `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning the result to `b`.
- Since `a` was already the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` now holds the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.
- All other variables remain unchanged or retain their initial conditions.
