Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must contain at least one element (but now has two less elements), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.** 

Explanation: The value of `suma` is updated to be the minimum of `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
