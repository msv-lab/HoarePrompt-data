The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
