The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, where `pos` contains the values of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop. `s` is the sum of the first `len(elements) - removals` integers in `elements`, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the updated `elements` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns 0 in one case. In another case, it returns the maximum value of `s - 2 * n`, where `s` is the sum of the first `len(elements) - removals` integers in `elements`, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the updated `elements` list.**
