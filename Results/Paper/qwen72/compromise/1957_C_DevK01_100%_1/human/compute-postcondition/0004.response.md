The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1 to 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, but now `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `dp` is a list with two elements: [1, 3], `i` is 3**
