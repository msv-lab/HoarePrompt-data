The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `n + 1`, so `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `dp` is a list with two elements, both equal to 1. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be adjusted to be at least 2, and `i` must be 2.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `dp` is a list with two elements, both equal to 1, `i` is 2**
