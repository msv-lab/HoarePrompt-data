Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `dp` is a list with two elements: [dp[n-1], dp[n]], `i` is n + 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is only used in the loop condition and is not modified within the loop.
- **`dp`**: The list `dp` is updated in each iteration. After `n` iterations, `dp` will contain the last two elements of the sequence generated by the loop. Specifically, `dp[0]` will be the value of `dp[n-1]` and `dp[1]` will be the value of `dp[n]`.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop has finished executing, because the loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`.

The loop generates a sequence where each element is calculated based on the previous two elements, and the list `dp` is updated to always contain the last two elements of this sequence. After `n` iterations, the final state of `dp` will be the last two elements of the sequence, and `i` will be one more than the final iteration index.
