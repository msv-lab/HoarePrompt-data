### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Move Processing:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the player and the computer place rooks, and these rooks occupy two distinct rows and columns.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only the player places a rook, and the computer skips its turn.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations for a board of size `n` after the initial moves.
   - The dynamic programming list `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which represents the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `n`, updating the `dp` list using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - The `dp` list is maintained with only the last two elements to save memory.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis:
- The move processing correctly accounts for the reduction in available positions on the board based on the initial moves and the computer's mirroring strategy.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1(n)` is correct for computing the number of possible final configurations. The formula used is derived from the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a board, considering the mirrored moves.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
