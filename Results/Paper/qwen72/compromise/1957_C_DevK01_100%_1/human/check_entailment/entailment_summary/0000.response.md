Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input, including the number of test cases `t`, the dimensions of the chessboard `n`, and the number of initial moves `k`. It also reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the board state.

2. **Board State Update**: The program updates the board state based on the initial moves. If the move is on a diagonal (i.e., `a == b`), it reduces `n` by 1 because the computer skips its turn. If the move is not on a diagonal, it reduces `n` by 2 because the computer mirrors the move, effectively placing two rooks.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations of the board. It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions. The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases `[1, 1]`, and the recurrence relation is correctly implemented:
   - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This relation accounts for the fact that for each new rook placed, there are two choices (either place a rook in a new row or a new column), and the previous configurations are used to build the new ones.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where `n` is reduced to 0 or 1 correctly. If `n` is 0, there are no more valid moves, and the function returns 1 (the base case). If `n` is 1, there is only one way to place the rook, and the function also returns 1.

6. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it processes each test case in linear time with respect to `n`.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
