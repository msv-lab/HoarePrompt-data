The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with `n` ranging from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive) and `k` ranging from 0 to 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns `0, 0`.
- **Case_2**: The function returns `0, 0`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, and if `n` is even, `max_k` is calculated as `n^2 / 2`, with the condition that `max_k` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 <= n <= 200,000 and 0 <= k <= 1,000,000,000,000. It returns `0, 0` in the first two cases. In the third case, it returns `n` and `k` if `k` is an even integer, and if `n` is odd, `max_k` is `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, or if `n` is even, `max_k` is `n^2 / 2`, with the condition that `max_k` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**
