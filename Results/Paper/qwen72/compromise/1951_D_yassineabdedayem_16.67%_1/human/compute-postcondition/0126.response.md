Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `k - Max` and must be greater than 0, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - Min` and must be greater than 0, and `number` is `Max`.***
