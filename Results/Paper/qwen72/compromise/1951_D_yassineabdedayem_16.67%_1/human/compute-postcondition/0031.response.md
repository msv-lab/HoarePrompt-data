Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, `k` is updated to be `k - Max` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
