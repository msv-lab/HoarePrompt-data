Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations.
- `k` is currently 0.
- `rep` is 60 or less.
- `tab` must have at least two elements.
- `i` is the second element of `tab`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `i`.
- According to the initial state, `i` is the second element of the list `tab`.
- Since `tab` must have at least two elements, `i` is guaranteed to be a valid element in the list.

### Output:
The code will print the second element of the list `tab` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the second element of the list `tab`)**
