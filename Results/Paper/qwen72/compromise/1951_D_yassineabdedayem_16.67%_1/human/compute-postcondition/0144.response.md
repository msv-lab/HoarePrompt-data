The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop. For the loop to execute, `tab` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a `number` value, `i` is the first element of `tab`, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop**
