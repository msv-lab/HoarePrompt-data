The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. Based on the initial state, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the conditions provided. The list `tab` initially contains a single string element. After appending `str(number)`, the list `tab` will contain two elements. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `rep` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(number)`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `tab` contains `str(Min)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Max`, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `tab` contains `str(Max)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and `number` is `Max`.**
