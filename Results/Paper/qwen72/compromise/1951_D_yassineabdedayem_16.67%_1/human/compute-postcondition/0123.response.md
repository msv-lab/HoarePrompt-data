Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - Max` and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `number` is `Min`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid after the update.
- The initial conditions for `n`, `Min`, and `Max` remain as specified.
