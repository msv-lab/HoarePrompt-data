Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop and is currently 0.
   - `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing at least 3 string elements.
   - `i` is the third string element in `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly defined as the third string element in the list `tab`.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `i` is the third string element in `tab`, the output will be the value of the third string element in `tab`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **[third string element in tab] (where the third string element in tab is the value of the third element in the list tab)**
