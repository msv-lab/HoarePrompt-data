Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `k - Max` and must be greater than 0, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - Min` and must be greater than 0, and `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for updating `Min`, `Max`, `k`, and `number` remain the same as in the initial state, and their values will be recalculated based on the new value of `n`.
