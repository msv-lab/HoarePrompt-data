To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of the variables `n`, `k`, and `rep` that are part of the loop condition. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:

1. **`n != 0`**: This condition must be true for the loop to execute. Since `n` is the first integer read from the input, it must be non-zero. We can assume `n` is non-zero as part of the input constraints.

2. **`k > 0`**: This condition must also be true for the loop to execute. Since `k` is the second integer read from the input, it must be greater than 0. We can assume `k` is greater than 0 as part of the input constraints.

3. **`rep < 60`**: This condition must be true for the loop to execute. Since `rep` is 0, it is already less than 60, so no adjustment is needed.

4. **`n >= k`**: This condition must be true for the loop to execute. Since `n` and `k` are read from the input, we need to ensure that `n` is at least as large as `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this is not part of the loop condition, so it remains unchanged).
- `_` is 1 (this is not part of the loop condition, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `rep` is 0 (this is already less than 60, so it remains unchanged).
- `tab` is an empty list (this is not part of the loop condition, so it remains unchanged).
- `number` is 0 (this is not part of the loop condition, so it remains unchanged).

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is at least as large as `k` and both `n` and `k` are non-zero and positive.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 0**
