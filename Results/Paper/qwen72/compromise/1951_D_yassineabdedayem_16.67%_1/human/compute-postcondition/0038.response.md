Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations, `k` is a positive integer that has been reduced by the sum of all `Min` or `Max` values subtracted from it over the iterations, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: After each iteration, `n` is reduced by the product of `Min` and `Max`. The final value of `n` will be the remainder after all such reductions.
- **`k`**: After each iteration, `k` is reduced by either `Min` or `Max` depending on the conditions inside the loop. The final value of `k` will be the initial `k` minus the sum of all these reductions.
- **`rep`**: This variable counts the number of iterations. The loop will stop either when `rep` reaches 60 or when one of the other loop conditions (`n == 0`, `k <= 0`, or `n < k`) is no longer satisfied.
- **`tab`**: This list will contain the string representations of all the `number` values that were appended during the iterations. Each `number` is either `Min` or `Max` based on the conditions inside the loop.
