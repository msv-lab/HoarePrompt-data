Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is now equal to `Min`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `number` is updated to the value of `Min`.
- `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
