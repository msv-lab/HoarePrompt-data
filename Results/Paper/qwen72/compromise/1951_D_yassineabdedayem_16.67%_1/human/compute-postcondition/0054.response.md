Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations. If `k` is 0, `tab` has all its elements printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.**
