Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is equal to `Min`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `Max` is equal to `k`, and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- `number` is assigned the value of `Min`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `Max` is equal to `k`.
- The product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`.
