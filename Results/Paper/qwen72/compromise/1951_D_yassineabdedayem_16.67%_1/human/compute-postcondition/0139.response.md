Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 2, `rep` is 3, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, the string representation of the updated `number`, and the string representation of the final `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is updated to `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min`, `number` is updated to `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is updated to `Max`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 2 to 3.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `k`, `number`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.
