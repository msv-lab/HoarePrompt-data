Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations.
- `k` is currently 0.
- `rep` is 60 or less.
- `tab` must have at least one element.
- `i` is the first element of `tab`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space. According to the initial state, `i` is the first element of the list `tab`.

Output: **[i] (where i is the first element of the list `tab`)**
