To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of a `number` value.
   - `i` is the second element of `tab`.
   - `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop.

2. **Context:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement is inside a loop, and `i` is the second element of the list `tab`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - `tab` is a list that contains string representations of a `number` value.
   - `i` is specifically the second element of `tab`.

Given the initial state, `i` is the second element of `tab`, and `tab` contains at least two string representations of a `number` value. Therefore, `i` will be the string representation of the second `number` value in the list `tab`.

Since the exact values of `tab` and `number` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the second element of `tab`.

Output: **[second element of tab] (where the second element of tab is the string representation of the second number value in the list tab)**
