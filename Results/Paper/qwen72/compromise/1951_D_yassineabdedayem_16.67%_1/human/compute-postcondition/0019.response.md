Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The initial values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated to the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively.
- The condition that `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, and that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` still holds.
- The value of `k` remains a positive integer greater than 0.
- The value of `rep` remains 1.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representation of `number`.
