Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated to be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it twice, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `k` and `n` are still valid.
- `Min` and `Max` are still defined based on the updated value of `n`.
- The logic for updating `k` and `number` based on the conditions remains the same.
