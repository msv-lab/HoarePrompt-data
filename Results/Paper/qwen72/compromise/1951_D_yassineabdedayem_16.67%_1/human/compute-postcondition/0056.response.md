Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `tab = []` reinitializes `tab` to an empty list, overriding the previous state where `tab` contained string representations of `number` values.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `number` remain unchanged.
- The condition about `k` being 0 and the elements of `tab` being printed, and `i` being the last element of `tab` is no longer applicable because `tab` is now empty.
- The precondition that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `rep` is 0, and `number` is 0 remains valid.
