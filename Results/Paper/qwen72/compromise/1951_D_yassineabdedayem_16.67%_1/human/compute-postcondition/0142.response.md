Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60).
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration.
- `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, or `number`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
