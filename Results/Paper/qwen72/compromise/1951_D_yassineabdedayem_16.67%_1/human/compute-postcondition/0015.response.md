The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` adds the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. The value of `number` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state. Let's break down the impact:

1. `number` is determined by the conditions:
   - If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.

2. `tab` is an empty list initially, and after the code snippet, it will contain the string representation of `number`.

3. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged except for the value of `k` which might be updated based on the conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**
