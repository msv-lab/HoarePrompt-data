To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`n != 0`**: This condition requires that `n` is not zero. If `n` is zero, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `n` must be non-zero for the loop to execute again.

2. **`k > 0`**: This condition requires that `k` is greater than zero. If `k` is zero or negative, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `k` must be positive for the loop to execute again.

3. **`rep < 60`**: This condition requires that `rep` is less than 60. If `rep` is 60 or greater, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `rep` must be less than 60 for the loop to execute again.

4. **`n >= k`**: This condition requires that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute again.

### Current State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
- `k` is `k - Max` if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min`.
- `rep` is 1.
- `tab` is a list containing a single string element `str(number)`.
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- `number` is `Min` if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute again.
- **`k`**: `k` must be positive for the loop to execute again.
- **`rep`**: `rep` must be less than 60 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
Since the loop can execute again if `n` is non-zero, `k` is positive, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, we need to ensure these conditions are met. The current state already indicates that `rep` is 1, which is less than 60, and `_` is 1, which is not relevant to the loop conditions. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` and `k` are adjusted to meet the loop conditions.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string element `str(number)`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min` if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`**
