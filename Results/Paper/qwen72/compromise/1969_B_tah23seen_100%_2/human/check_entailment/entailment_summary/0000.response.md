Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum total cost to cyclically shift a binary string to make it sorted in non-descending order. The provided function `func_1` attempts to calculate this cost by iterating through the string and accumulating a cost whenever a '0' is encountered after a '1'. The cost is calculated as the number of '1's seen so far plus one.

Let's break down the logic of the function and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns the accumulated `cost`.

This logic is based on the idea that each '0' that appears after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '0' to the front, and the cost of this shift is the length of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0'. This is because each '0' needs to be moved past all the '1's that came before it.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic. The function does not account for the fact that the entire string might need to be shifted if there are '1's at the end of the string and '0's at the beginning. For example, in the string "101011", the optimal strategy involves shifting the entire string, which the function does not handle correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If the string is already sorted, the cost is 0.
- If there are '1's at the end and '0's at the beginning, the cost should be the length of the string minus the number of '1's at the end and '0's at the beginning.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:
- For "10", the function correctly returns 2.
- For "0000", the function correctly returns 0.
- For "11000", the function correctly returns 9.
- For "101011", the function returns 5, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 5 (as the entire string needs to be shifted).
- For "01101001", the function returns 11, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 7 (as the entire string needs to be shifted).

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those where the entire string needs to be shifted.

Correctness: **False**
