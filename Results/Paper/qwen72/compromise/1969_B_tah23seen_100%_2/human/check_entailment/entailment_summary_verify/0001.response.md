### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all cyclic shifts.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - The algorithm works by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - When a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the positions where a '0' appears after a '1', which are the points where a cyclic shift is needed to move the '0' to the left of the '1's.
   - The cost of each shift is calculated as `one + 1` because:
     - The substring to be shifted includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
     - The length of this substring is `one + 1`.
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of all such shifts.

4. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary states that `func_1` returns the total number of '0's in `s` multiplied by the number of '1's that appear before each '0', plus the total number of '0's in `s`.
   - This is not entirely accurate. The function actually returns the sum of `one + 1` for each '0' encountered after a '1', which is the correct cost for the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "111"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "000"), the algorithm correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the string "10":
     - The algorithm will shift the entire string once, resulting in a cost of 2.
   - For the string "0000":
     - The algorithm will not perform any shifts, resulting in a cost of 0.
   - For the string "11000":
     - The algorithm will perform three shifts, each with a cost of 3, resulting in a total cost of 9.
   - For the string "101011":
     - The algorithm will perform two shifts, one with a cost of 3 and one with a cost of 2, resulting in a total cost of 5.
   - For the string "01101001":
     - The algorithm will perform three shifts, one with a cost of 3, one with a cost of 2, and one with a cost of 3, resulting in a total cost of 11.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem by identifying the necessary cyclic shifts and calculating their costs. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as expected. The function summary is slightly inaccurate but does not affect the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
