The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, and they must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns a list of `n` integers, where each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The returned list should have exactly `k` cyclic shifts that are sorted. If no such list exists, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and returns a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that exactly `k` cyclic shifts of the list are sorted. If no such list exists, it returns -1.**
