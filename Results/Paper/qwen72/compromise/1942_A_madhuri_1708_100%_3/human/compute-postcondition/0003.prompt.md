You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers, n and k, as input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and return a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and exactly k of the n cyclic shifts of the list are sorted. If no such list exists, the function should return -1.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line), splits the line into two integers n and k, and then prints a list of n integers based on the conditions: if k is greater than or equal to 2, it prints a list of n integers all equal to k if n equals k, otherwise it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 1 to n. The loop continues until all lines are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and returns a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that exactly `k` cyclic shifts of the list are sorted. If no such list exists, it returns -1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
