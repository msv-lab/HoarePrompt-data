You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array of integers with a length of at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to process the integer \( X \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of subsequences.
   - It also initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of subsequences found.
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints 1 and 0, which is correct because the array \([0]\) has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: \([0]\) and the empty subsequence.
   - The program then enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into powers of 2.
     - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and appends the corresponding length to `subseq_lens`.
     - It subtracts this power of 2 from \( X \) and updates `mx` if necessary.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by appending the lengths of the subsequences found.
   - It prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is 2.
   - The loop decomposes \( X \) into powers of 2, which is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the lengths of the subsequences, which ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`, which is the correct format for the output.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where \( X \) is a large number up to \( 10^{18} \).
   - The program should ensure that the length of the array does not exceed 200.
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) cannot be decomposed into a valid array (though the problem guarantees \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \), so this case should not occur).

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1. According to the problem, \( X \) is guaranteed to be at least 2, so this is not an issue.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200, but the decomposition into powers of 2 should not result in an array longer than 200 for the given range of \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. It correctly decomposes \( X \) into powers of 2 and constructs the array accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
