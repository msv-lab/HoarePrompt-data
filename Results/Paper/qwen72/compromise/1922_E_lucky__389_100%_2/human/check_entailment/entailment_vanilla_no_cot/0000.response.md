Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Modulo Usage**: The program defines a `MOD` variable but does not use it. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Length Calculation**: The program attempts to find the lengths of increasing subsequences by repeatedly subtracting powers of 2 from `x`. However, this approach does not correctly handle all cases, especially when `x` is not a power of 2.

3. **Incorrect Array Construction**: The program constructs the array `ansv` by appending the indices of the subsequence lengths, but this does not ensure that the array has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. The construction logic is flawed.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `x` is 1, the program should return `-1` because it is impossible to have exactly 1 increasing subsequence (since the problem states that the number of increasing subsequences must be at least 2).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to construct an array that has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. One way to do this is to use a combination of elements that can form the required number of subsequences. For example, if `x` is a power of 2, you can use a sequence of distinct elements. If `x` is not a power of 2, you can use a combination of repeated elements and distinct elements to achieve the desired number of subsequences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    if x == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to x
    largest_power = int(math.log2(x))
    remaining = x - 2 ** largest_power
    
    # Construct the array
    ansv = [i for i in range(largest_power)]
    if remaining > 0:
        ansv.append(largest_power)
        remaining -= 1
    while remaining > 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= remaining:
            i += 1
        i -= 1
        ansv.append(largest_power + i)
        remaining -= 2 ** i
    
    print(len(ansv))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ansv)))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Edge Case for `x = 1`**: The program correctly handles the case where `x` is 1 by printing `-1`.

2. **Largest Power of 2**: The program finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and constructs an initial array with distinct elements up to that power.

3. **Remaining Subsequences**: If there are remaining subsequences, the program adds elements to the array to account for them. This is done by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the remaining number of subsequences and appending the corresponding index to the array.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the constructed array and the array itself.

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly.
