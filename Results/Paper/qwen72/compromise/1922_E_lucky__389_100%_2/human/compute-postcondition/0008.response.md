To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `x != 0`. The state right before the loop indicates that `x` is an input integer and is not equal to 2. However, this does not guarantee that `x` is not equal to 0, which is the condition required for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to ensure it is not 0. Since `x` is an input integer and is expected to handle multiple test cases where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), we can safely assume that `x` should be a positive integer within this range to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0 and not equal to 2**
