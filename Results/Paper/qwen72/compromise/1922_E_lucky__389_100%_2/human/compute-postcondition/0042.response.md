To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. Given that `i` is now 0 and `x` is an input integer and not 0, we need to ensure that `2 ** i` (which is 1 when `i` is 0) is less than or equal to `x`.

Since `x` is already given as a positive integer and not 0, the condition `2 ** 0 <= x` (which simplifies to `1 <= x`) will always be true for any positive `x`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is not 0, `i` is 0**
