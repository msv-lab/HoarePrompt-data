The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still satisfy the condition `2 ** i <= x`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to 2. The condition `2 ** i <= x` must still hold true, which means `2 ** 2 <= x` or `4 <= x`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`x` is an input integer, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 4, `i` is 2**
