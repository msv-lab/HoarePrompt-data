The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an input integer and not 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `2 ** i` must still be less than or equal to `x` after `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `2 ** 2` (which is 4) must be less than or equal to `x`. This means `x` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 1**
