Output State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is not 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^i\) is greater than the input integer `x`. This means that the loop will stop when `i` reaches the point where \(2^i\) exceeds `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as the loop only modifies `i` and does not alter `x` directly.
