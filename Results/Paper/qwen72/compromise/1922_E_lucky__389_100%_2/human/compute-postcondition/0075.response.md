Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input. It prints the length of an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, followed by the elements of the array. If `X` is 2, it prints `1` and `0` and returns -1. If no such array exists, it also returns -1. The elements of the array are within the range [-10^9, 10^9] and the array has a length of at most 200. **
