The function `solve` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function should process a series of test cases, where the number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, the function must either print -1 if no such array exists, or print a positive integer n (n ≤ 200) followed by n integers that form an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. All elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
