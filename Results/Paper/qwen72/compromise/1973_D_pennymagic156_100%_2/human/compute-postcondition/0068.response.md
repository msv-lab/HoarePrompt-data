To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is not zero.
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 3.
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `l < n + 1`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - Since `k` is a positive integer and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), `cnt` can be 0 if `k` is 1, or it can be a positive integer if `k > 1`.

2. **Check `l`**:
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `l < n + 1` is given.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute again if `cnt` is not 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be non-zero. Given that `cnt` is `k - 1`, and `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` will be non-zero as long as `k > 1`.
- **`l`**: `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1` is already satisfied, no adjustment is needed for `l`.

Since `cnt` is `k - 1` and `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` will be non-zero as long as `k > 1`. Therefore, the only condition that needs to be ensured is that `k` is greater than 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 1`, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l < n + 1`.**
