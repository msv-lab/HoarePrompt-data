To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 2`.
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`.

2. **Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `v` is determined by the condition that `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists. Since `i` is 2, and there is no further context indicating that `v` should be `n`, `v` will be 1.
   - `l` is the result of `func_2() + 1`. Without knowing the implementation of `func_2()`, we can only say that `l` is some value returned by `func_2()` plus 1, and it is guaranteed that `l < n + 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `i` is 2.
     - `v` is 1.
     - `i * v` is `2 * 1` which is 2.
     - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [func_2() + 1] 2** (where `[func_2() + 1]` is the value of `l` which is `func_2() + 1` and is guaranteed to be less than `n + 1`)
