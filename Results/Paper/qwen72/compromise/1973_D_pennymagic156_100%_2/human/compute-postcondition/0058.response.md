Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` is equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is 2.

2. **Value of `v`:**
   - The value of `v` is determined by the condition that `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - Since `i` is 2, and there is no specific condition that `v` should be `n` for `i = 2`, `v` will be 1.

3. **Value of `l`:**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` and is equal to `n + 1`.
   - This implies that `func_2()` returns `n`.

4. **Value of `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Calculation:
- `i` is 2.
- `v` is 1.
- Therefore, `i * v` is `2 * 1` which equals 2.

### Output:
The code will print the formatted string with the value of `i * v`.
Output: **! 2**
