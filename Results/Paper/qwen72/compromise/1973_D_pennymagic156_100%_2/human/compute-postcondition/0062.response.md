To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`.
- Additionally, either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n // k + 1 - 1` (inclusive). This means the loop will stop when `i` reaches `n // k + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, and `l` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 3.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 3, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`. Additionally, either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
