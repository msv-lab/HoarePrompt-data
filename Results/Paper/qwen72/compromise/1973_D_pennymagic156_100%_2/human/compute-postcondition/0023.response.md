Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1.** 

Explanation: The variables `cnt` and `l` are initialized to the values of `k` and 1, respectively. The initial state conditions for `n`, `k`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged.
