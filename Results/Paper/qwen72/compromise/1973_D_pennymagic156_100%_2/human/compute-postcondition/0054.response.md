The code snippet `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l`. According to the initial state, `l` was already defined as `func_2() + 1` and it was stated that `l < n + 1`. Since the code snippet reassigns `l` using the same expression, the value of `l` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 2`, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`.**
