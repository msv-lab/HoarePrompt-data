The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Since `cnt` was initially `k - 1`, after the decrement, `cnt` becomes `k - 2`. The values of `n`, `v`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
