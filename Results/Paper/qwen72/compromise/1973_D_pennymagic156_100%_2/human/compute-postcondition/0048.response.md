To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **`cnt`**: The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is not zero.
2. **`l < n + 1`**: The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero. Given that `cnt` is `k - 1`, and `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` will be non-zero as long as `k > 1`. Since `k` is given to be within the range \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), `cnt` will be non-zero if `k > 1`.
- **`l`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value such that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- `cnt` is already non-zero if `k > 1`, which is a valid condition given the constraints.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value such that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the current state, no adjustments are necessary because the conditions are already met for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**.
