Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (a value less than `n + 1`).**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `k`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`v`**: This also remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `v`.
- **`i`**: This remains 1 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt`**: Initially set to `k`, it is decremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After `k` iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`l`**: This is updated to `func_2() + 1` in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `l` will be `func_2() + 1`, which is a value less than `n + 1`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final state is as described above.
