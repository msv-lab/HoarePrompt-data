To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 3.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.
- `l < n + 1`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the variables used in the `print` statement:

1. `l` is explicitly given as 1.
2. `i` is explicitly given as 3.
3. `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists. Since `i` is 3, and there is no condition that specifies `v` should be `n`, `v` will be 1.

Now, let's substitute these values into the `print` statement:

```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Substituting the values:
- `l` is 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `v` is 1.

So, the expression `i * v` becomes `3 * 1` which is 3.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
```
? 1 3
```

Output: **? 1 3**
