The function `func_2()` is called, but since its implementation is not provided, we cannot determine its exact effect on the program's state. However, based on the initial state, we know that `l` is already set to `func_2() + 1`, and it is given that `l < n + 1`. This implies that calling `func_2()` again does not change the value of `l` or any other variable directly, as the function call itself does not modify any global variables or return a value that affects the state.

Therefore, the only change that might occur is if `func_2()` has side effects, but without knowing its implementation, we assume it does not alter the state. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`. Additionally, either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. The loop will have printed `! {i * v}` where `i` is the last value of `i` before the loop terminates.**
