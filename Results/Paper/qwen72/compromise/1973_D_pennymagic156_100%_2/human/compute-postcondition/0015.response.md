The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by `1` each time.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by `1`, making it `n-2`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be greater than `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `i` is `n-2`**.
