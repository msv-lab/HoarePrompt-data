The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the step value `-1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and `v` is 1, these conditions already ensure that `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` or `k`.

However, for the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to `n`, and the loop will decrement `i` until it reaches 0 (exclusive). Thus, the initial state of `i` should be set to `n`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is 1, `i` is `n`**
