To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `cnt`: This is a part of the loop condition. The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is non-zero.
   - `l`: This is also part of the loop condition. The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the `while` loop must be satisfied:
     - `cnt` must be non-zero.
     - `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`. Since `k` is a positive integer and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), `cnt` is initially `k - 1`, which is non-zero.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. We need to ensure that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `cnt` is already non-zero, so no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

### Final State:
Since `cnt` is already non-zero and `l` must be less than `n + 1`, the state remains the same as the previous iteration, assuming `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2() < n`**
