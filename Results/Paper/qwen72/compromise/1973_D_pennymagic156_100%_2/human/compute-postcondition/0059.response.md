The function `func_2()` is called, but its implementation is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the program state. However, based on the initial state, we know that `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1` and is equal to `n + 1`. This implies that `func_2()` returns `n`.

Since `func_2()` does not modify any of the variables explicitly mentioned in the initial state (such as `n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, or `l`), the only change is that `func_2()` has been executed, which we can infer from the context.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional note that `func_2()` has been executed.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, and `func_2()` has been executed.**
