Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then, for each test case, reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. **Stair Condition**: It checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
3. **Peak Condition**: It checks if `a < b` and `b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
4. **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all the specified cases correctly. The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input as expected and prints the correct output for each set of digits.

Correctness: **True**
