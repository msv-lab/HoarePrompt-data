The only objects in the loop head are the variables `suit` and `rank`, which are derived from the `suits` dictionary. For the loop to execute, the `suits` dictionary must have at least one key-value pair. The state of `trumps` and `answers` lists are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`suits` is a dictionary that must have at least one key-value pair, `suit` is the first key in `suits`, `rank` is the value associated with the first key in `suits`**
