### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1(n)` and prints the result.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1(s)` is defined to take a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `d` to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position. The initial balance is set to 0.

3. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The dictionary `d` is updated with the balance at each position.

4. **Dictionary Manipulation:**
   - The program removes the last element from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`.
   - It then sorts the dictionary items based on the balance (`x[1]`) in increasing order and, for ties, by the position (`x[0]`) in decreasing order.

5. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from the input string `s` based on the sorted positions.
   - Finally, it returns the result string `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Balance Calculation:**
  - The balance is correctly calculated for each prefix of the string.
  - The dictionary `d` stores the balance at each position, which is necessary for the balanced shuffle operation.

- **Sorting:**
  - The sorting step is crucial. The program sorts the dictionary items by balance in increasing order and, for ties, by position in decreasing order.
  - This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

- **Result Construction:**
  - The program constructs the result string by appending characters from the input string based on the sorted positions.
  - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Potential Issues:

- **Dictionary Initialization:**
  - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which is correct for the balance at the start of the string.
  - However, the dictionary should be initialized with `d[0] = 0` and then updated for each position from 1 to n-1. The program correctly updates the balance for each position.

- **Dictionary Removal:**
  - The program removes the last element from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the last position is not needed for the sorting step.
  - This step is correct and necessary.

- **Character Appending:**
  - The program appends characters from the input string based on the sorted positions.
  - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the balance, sorts the positions, and constructs the result string accordingly.

### Correctness:
**True**
