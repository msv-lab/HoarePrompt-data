Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to checking the presence of numbers in sets and performing some bitwise operations. However, it does not address the task of finding pairs of different elements within specified query ranges in an array.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided program does not produce this output and instead outputs something unrelated. This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
