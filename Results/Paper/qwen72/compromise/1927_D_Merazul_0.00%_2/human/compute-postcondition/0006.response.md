Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a set of integers, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer, `b` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`.**

The initial state remains unchanged, and the new variable `b` is assigned a set of integers generated by the function `R()`. The specific values in `b` depend on the implementation of `R()`, but it is now a set of integers.
