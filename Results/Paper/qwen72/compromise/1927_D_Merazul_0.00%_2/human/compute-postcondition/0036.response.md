Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is `k // 2`, `a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is the last element returned by the function `R()`, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `u` is `False`, `v` is `False`**

Explanation:
- `m` and `n` are both assigned the value of `k // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `q`, `k`, `b`, `f`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
