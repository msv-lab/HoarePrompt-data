Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve a problem where it needs to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve this problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Formula for `x`**: The formula used to calculate `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). This formula does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0\) is not the correct way to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Subtracting 2 from `suma`**: The program subtracts 2 from `suma` at the end, which is not justified based on the problem statement. This subtraction is likely incorrect and could lead to incorrect results.

4. **GCD Calculation Missing**: The program does not calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), which is essential for the problem.

5. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b`, but it should be iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges to correctly count the valid pairs.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
