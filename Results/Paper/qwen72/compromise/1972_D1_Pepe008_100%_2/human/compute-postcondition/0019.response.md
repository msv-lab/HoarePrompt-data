The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `b` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `b + 1`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 2, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
