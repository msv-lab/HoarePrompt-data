Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 2. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 + 1` and `x` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`. Otherwise, `suma` and `x` retain their original values, which are both `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`.***
