Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 2, `i` is 3, `x` is now `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is now `suma + x + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1.
- The initial value of `suma` was `suma + x`, so after the increment, `suma` becomes `suma + x + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
