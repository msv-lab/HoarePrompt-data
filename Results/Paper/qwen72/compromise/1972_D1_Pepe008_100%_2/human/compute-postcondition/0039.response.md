The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `b + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `b` must still be at least 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is 0, and `x` is calculated as `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`. If `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
