The loop head contains the variables `i`, `b`, and implicitly `a` and `range(1, b + 1)`. The loop will execute again if `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, b + 1)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `b + 1`, which means the loop has just finished its last iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
- After the last iteration, `i` is `b + 1`, which is outside the range `1` to `b`.

Since `i` is already `b + 1`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**. The loop will not execute again because `i` is already `b + 1`.
