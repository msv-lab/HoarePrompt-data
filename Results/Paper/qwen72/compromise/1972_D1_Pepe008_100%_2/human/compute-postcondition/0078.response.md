Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `T` is greater than 1.
   - `t` is 2.
   - `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
   - `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0.
   - `i` is `b + 1`.
   - `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values for each iteration from 1 to `b`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `a` and `b` are derived from the list `info`. `a` is the first element, and `b` is the second element, which must be at least 0.
   - `i` is calculated as `b + 1`.
   - `suma` is the sum of all integers from 1 to `b`.

3. **Sum of Integers from 1 to `b`**:
   - The sum of the first `b` positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{suma} = \frac{b \times (b + 1)}{2}
     \]

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is:
     \[
     \text{print(suma - 2)}
     \]
   - This will print the value of `suma` minus 2.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Substitute the formula for `suma`:
     \[
     \text{print}\left(\frac{b \times (b + 1)}{2} - 2\right)
     \]

6. **Output**:
   - The output will be the value of \(\frac{b \times (b + 1)}{2} - 2\).

Output: **\(\frac{b \times (b + 1)}{2} - 2\) (where \(b\) is the second element of the `info` list and must be at least 0)**
