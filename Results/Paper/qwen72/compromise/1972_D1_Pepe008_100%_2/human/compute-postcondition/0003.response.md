Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**

The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are now assigned the integer values of the first and second elements of the list `info`, respectively.
