Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values plus any additional 1s added when the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` are met, `info` is a list of strings obtained from user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])` reassigns the values of `a` and `b` to the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]`, respectively.
- Since `a` and `b` were already defined as the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]` in the initial state, this code does not change their values.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `suma` remain unchanged.
- The initial state information about `info` being a list of strings obtained from user input is still valid.
