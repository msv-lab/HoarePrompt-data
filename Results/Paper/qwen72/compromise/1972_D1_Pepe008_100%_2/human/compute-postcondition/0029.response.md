Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `info` is a list of strings from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])` reassigns the values of `a` and `b` to the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]` respectively. Since `a` and `b` were already defined as the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]` in the initial state, their values remain unchanged. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
