Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `t` is 0.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least `b` (this seems redundant, so we can assume `b` is an integer value).
- `i` is initialized to `b`.
- `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(suma - 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts at `b`.
   - `suma` is initially 0.

2. **Loop Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from `b` and calculates `x` as \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\).
   - `x` is only added to `suma` if it is a valid integer value.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `suma`.
   - However, we know that `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code prints `suma - 2`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `suma`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the value of `suma` minus 2.

Output: **suma - 2 (where suma is the sum of all valid x values calculated in the loop, and x is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i for each valid i starting from b)**
