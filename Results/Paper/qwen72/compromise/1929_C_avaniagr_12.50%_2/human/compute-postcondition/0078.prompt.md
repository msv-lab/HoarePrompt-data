Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k, x, and a are integers such that 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` < `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` >= `k - 1`, then if `x` == `k - 1`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `i` is set to `x` and `z` is set to `x + 1`. In both cases, the function performs operations based on the value of `a` relative to `z`, but `i` remains `x` and `z` remains `x + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `x < k - 1`, then if `a` >= `x` + 1, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds; otherwise, the condition `a < x + 1` holds. If `x >= k - 1`, then if `x` == `k - 1`, `a` is checked against `x + 3`: if `a` >= `x + 3`, the condition `a >= x + 3` holds; otherwise, the condition `a < x + 3` holds. If `x` != `k - 1`, `z` is set to `x + 1` + `x` // (`k - 1`), and `i` is set to `x`. If `a` >= `z`, the condition `a >= z` holds; otherwise, the condition `a < z` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, with `t` being greater than the new value of `_`. If `x` < `k - 1`, there are no changes to `a`. If `x` == `k - 1`, there are no changes to `a`. Otherwise, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `z` is the sum of 1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1 repeated `x + 1` times, and `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
