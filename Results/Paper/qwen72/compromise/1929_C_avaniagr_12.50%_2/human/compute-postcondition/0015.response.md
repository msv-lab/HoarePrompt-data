Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`.***
