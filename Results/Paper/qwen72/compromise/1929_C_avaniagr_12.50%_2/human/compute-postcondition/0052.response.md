Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is `x + 1` + `x` // (`k - 1`), and `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `a` is less than `z`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.***
