Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is a precondition).
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n` + 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is `1`, which is a constant.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This means it will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The constant `1` will be printed.
   - The value of `n` will be printed.
   - The range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) will be printed.

Given that `n` must be at least 2, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 2. For `n = 2`:
- `1` will be printed.
- `n` (which is 2) will be printed.
- `*range(1, 3)` will unpack to `1, 2`.

So, the output for `n = 2` would be:
```
1 2 1 2
```

For a general `n` (where `n` is at least 2):
- The output will be `1`, followed by `n`, followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
