The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, another integer `n` where 1 <= n <= 500. The function's output is not clearly specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation or check based on these integers and returns a result accordingly.

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) and, for each test case, an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500). It returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n`, but the specific output is not provided.**
