Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n` + 1.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum, n + n)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `sum` is calculated as \( n^3 \). Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `sum` will be the cube of `n`.
   - `n + n` is simply `2 * n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `sum` and the value of `2 * n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the exact value of `sum` will be \( n^3 \) and the exact value of `2 * n` will be `2 * n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **\( n^3 \), \( 2 * n \) (where \( n \) is an integer greater than or equal to 2)**
