Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `sum` is defined by the formula: \(1 + (2^2 - 1^2) \cdot 2 + (3^2 - 2^2) \cdot 3 + \ldots + (n^2 - (n-1)^2) \cdot n\).
   - `i` is \(n + 1\).
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation of the Print Statement:**
   - The first argument is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to \(n - 2 + 1 = n - 1\).
   - The third argument is the unpacked range from 1 to `n + 1`. This will produce a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 1`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **2, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence from 1 to n is the unpacked range from 1 to n inclusive)**
