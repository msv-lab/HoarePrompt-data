The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 2

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3
- `n` must still be at least 2, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 7, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, `t` is `t` - 1**
