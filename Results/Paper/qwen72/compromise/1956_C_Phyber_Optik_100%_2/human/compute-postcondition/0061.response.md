Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \) (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `n` + 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to `n - 3 + 1`, which is `n - 2`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which means all elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) will be unpacked and printed.

4. **Calculating the Values:**
   - Since `n` must be at least 3, let's assume the minimum value of `n` is 3.
   - For `n = 3`:
     - `n - 2` is `3 - 2`, which is `1`.
     - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 4)`, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output: `1, 1, 1, 2, 3`.

However, since `n` can be any integer greater than or equal to 3, let's generalize the output:

- The first value is always `1`.
- The second value is `n - 2`.
- The subsequent values are the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is an integer at least 3)**
