To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, n + 1):`.
   - This means `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3.
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Final State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
   - `sum` remains the same (unchanged).
   - `i` is 4.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3, `i` is 4**
