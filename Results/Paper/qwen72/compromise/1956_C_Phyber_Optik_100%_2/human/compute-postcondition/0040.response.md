Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's given as a precondition).
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \) (this value is not used in the print statement, but it's part of the precondition).
   - `i` is `n + 1` (this value is not used in the print statement, but it's part of the precondition).
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to `n - 3 + 1`, which is `n - 2`.
   - The third part of the print statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first value is `1`.
   - The second value is `n - 2`.
   - The subsequent values are all integers from 1 to `n`.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, the output will be:

Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
