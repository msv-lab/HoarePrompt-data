Output State: **`t` is 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \) for each executed `n`, `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2 for each execution.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, and each iteration consumes one value of `t`.
- **`sum` is \( n^3 \) for each executed `n`**: The inner loop calculates the sum of a series of terms, and the final value of `sum` after each iteration of the outer loop is \( n^3 \). This is because the expression `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` simplifies to `2 * i - 1`, and when multiplied by `i`, it results in `i * (2 * i - 1)`, which sums up to \( n^3 \) for the given range.
- **`i` is `n` + 1**: After the inner loop completes, the value of `i` will be `n` + 1, as the loop iterates from 2 to `n`.
- **`j` is `n`**: The value of `j` will be `n` after the innermost loop completes, as it iterates from 1 to `n`.
- **`n` must be at least 2 for each execution**: For each test case, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute and produce the expected output. This condition is true for each iteration of the outer loop.
