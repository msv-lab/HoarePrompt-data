The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be at least 3

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4. For the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 19, `i` is 4, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 4, `t` is `t` - 1**
