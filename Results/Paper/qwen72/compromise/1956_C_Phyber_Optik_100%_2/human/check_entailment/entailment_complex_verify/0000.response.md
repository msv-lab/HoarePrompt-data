### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the sum calculation in the program is incorrect.
   - The program uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i \times i - (i - 1) \times (i - 1)) \times i
     \]
     Let's break this down:
     \[
     i \times i - (i - 1) \times (i - 1) = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
     Therefore, the formula becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
     \]
     Simplifying further:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
     Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
     We can adjust the sums to start from 2:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - 1
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1
     \]
     Substituting these into the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{3} - \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n + 1)(2n + 1) - 3n(n + 1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 2)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n - 1)}{3}
     \]
   - This formula is not the correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations. The correct maximum sum is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times n}{2} = \frac{n^2 (n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - For \( n = 2 \), the correct sum should be:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2^2 (2 + 1)}{2} = 6
     \]
     But the program outputs \( 7 \), which is incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program always prints \( 2n \) operations, which is more than necessary for some cases.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the correct output should be:
     \[
     1 1
     1 1 1
     \]
     But the program outputs:
     \[
     1 2
     1 1 1
     2 1 1
     \]
     This is more than necessary and incorrect for \( n = 1 \).

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case.
   - The sum calculation is incorrect, as explained above.
   - The operations are always printed in a fixed pattern, which is not necessarily optimal for all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and does not handle the case \( n = 1 \) correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
