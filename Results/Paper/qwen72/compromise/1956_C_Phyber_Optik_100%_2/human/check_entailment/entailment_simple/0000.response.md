Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function initializes the variable `sum` to 1. This is incorrect for the general case. For `n = 1`, the sum should indeed be 1, but for `n > 1`, the sum should be calculated differently.
   - The loop `for i in range(2, n + 1)` is intended to calculate the sum of the matrix elements after performing the operations. However, the formula used inside the loop, `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, is not correct for the problem's requirements. The correct formula to maximize the sum of the matrix is to fill the matrix with the maximum possible values, which is `n * n * (n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Output of Operations**:
   - The function prints the sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`. This is correct as the problem allows up to `2 * n` operations.
   - The function then prints `n` operations of type 1 and `n` operations of type 2, each applying a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` to the rows and columns, respectively. This is a valid approach to fill the matrix with the maximum values, but the sum calculation is incorrect.

4. **State After Execution**:
   - The comments indicate that after the loop, `t` is 0, which is not relevant since `t` is not modified inside the loop.
   - `sum` is calculated using the incorrect formula, so it will not be the maximum possible sum.
   - `i` and `j` are correctly described as being `n + 1` and `n`, respectively, after the loops.

Given the incorrect sum calculation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
