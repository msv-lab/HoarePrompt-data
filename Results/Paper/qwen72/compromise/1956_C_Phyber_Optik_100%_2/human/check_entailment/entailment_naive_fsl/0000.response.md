Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix for all potential cases. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the sum is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element can be a distinct integer from 1 to \( n \), is \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times n}{2} \). The program's formula does not match this.

For example, when \( n = 2 \), the correct maximum sum should be \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 \), but the program outputs \( 7 \). This discrepancy indicates that the program is not correctly calculating the maximum sum.

Additionally, the program always prints \( 2n \) operations, which is not necessary. The problem description states that the solution should use no more than \( 2n \) operations, but it does not require using exactly \( 2n \) operations. For \( n = 1 \), the program outputs 2 operations, which is more than necessary. The correct output for \( n = 1 \) should be:

```
1 1
1 1 1
```

This example shows that the program does not handle the case \( n = 1 \) correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
