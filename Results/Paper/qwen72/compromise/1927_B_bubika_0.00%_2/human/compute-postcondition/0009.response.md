Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros with `b[0]` incremented by 1, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is 'a', `i` is the first integer in the list `s` and is 0, `x` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `a` remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- `b` is a list of 26 zeros, and `b[0]` is incremented by 1, making it 1.
- `t` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- `s` remains a list of integers with at least 1 integer.
- `r` remains 'a'.
- `i` is the first integer in the list `s` and is 0.
- `x` is 0, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1, so `b[0]` is now 1.
