Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros with `b[0]` incremented by 1, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is 'a', `i` is the first integer in the list `s` and is 0, `x` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros with `b[0]` incremented by 1 and `b[x]` incremented by 1, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `r` is 'a' followed by the character at index `x` in `a`, `i` is the second integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros with `b[0]` incremented by 1 and `b[x]` incremented by 2, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `r` is 'a' followed by the character at index `x` in `a` repeated twice, `i` is the third integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
