Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index `x` is incremented by 1, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a`, `i` is the second integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` updates the value of `x` to the index of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
