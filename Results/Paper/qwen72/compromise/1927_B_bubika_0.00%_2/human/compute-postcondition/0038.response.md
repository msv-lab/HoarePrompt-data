The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and the input integer `n`. The loop can execute again if `t` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1, so `t` is now 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the string containing the characters at the indices in `a` corresponding to the values in `s`, `i` is the last integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`**
