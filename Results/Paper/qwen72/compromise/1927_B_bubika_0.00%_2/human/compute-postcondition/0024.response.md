To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is a non-empty list. Given the state before the loop starts, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` will take the value of the first integer in `s` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first integer in `s`**
