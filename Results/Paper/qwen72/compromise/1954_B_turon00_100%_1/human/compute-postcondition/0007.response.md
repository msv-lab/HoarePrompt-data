The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0**
