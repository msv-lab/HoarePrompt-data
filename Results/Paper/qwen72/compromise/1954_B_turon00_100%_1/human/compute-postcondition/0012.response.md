Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the variable `cnt` to 0, but since `cnt` was already 0 in the initial state, no change occurs. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
