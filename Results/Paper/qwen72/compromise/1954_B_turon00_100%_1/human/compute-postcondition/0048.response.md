Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1.***
