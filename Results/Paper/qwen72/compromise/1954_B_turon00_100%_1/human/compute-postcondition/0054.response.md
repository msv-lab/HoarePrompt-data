Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- **`n`**: Remains greater than 0, indicating the length of the list `a`.
- **`a`**: The list of integers provided by the user remains unchanged.
- **`tmp`**: Still holds the value of the first element of the list `a`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- **`cnt`**: This variable will hold the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`. If the last element is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`ans`**: This variable will hold the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`. If no such consecutive elements are found, `ans` will be 0. If the entire list consists of elements equal to `tmp`, `ans` will be `n`.
