Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.** 

The code snippet `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and the condition regarding the first element of `a` and `tmp` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, which is now 0.
