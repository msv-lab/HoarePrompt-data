The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`
- `i` is 2
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`
- Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0

Let's evaluate the impact of the code:

1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`.
   - `ans = min(n, 2)`
   - Since `n` is greater than 2, `ans` will be 2.

2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.
   - `ans = min(0, 0)`
   - `ans` remains 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2, and `ans` is 2.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2, and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**
