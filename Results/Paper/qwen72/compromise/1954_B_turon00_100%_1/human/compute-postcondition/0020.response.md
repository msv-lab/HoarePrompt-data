Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is 0 or `n` depending on the initial condition.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` could be 2 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, or 0 if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`. After the increment, `cnt` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 3 if it was initially 2. The value of `ans` remains unchanged, so it is still 0 or `n` depending on the initial condition. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.
