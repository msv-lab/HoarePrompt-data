Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the last element of the list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0. `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- `n` remains the input integer, indicating the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` remains the list of integers provided by the user.
- `tmp` is still the first element of the list `a`.
- `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`. If the last element of the list `a` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop. If no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`, then `ans` remains `n`.
