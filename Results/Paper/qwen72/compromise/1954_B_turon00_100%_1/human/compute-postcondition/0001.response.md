To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is assigned the value of the input integer.
- The function `func` is expected to handle a list of test cases, but this is not directly relevant to the loop head.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be a positive integer. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
