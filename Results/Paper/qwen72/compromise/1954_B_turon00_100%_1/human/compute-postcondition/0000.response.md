Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable not shown in the function definition, typically involving a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where the array a is guaranteed to be beautiful. The number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is assigned the value of the input integer.**
