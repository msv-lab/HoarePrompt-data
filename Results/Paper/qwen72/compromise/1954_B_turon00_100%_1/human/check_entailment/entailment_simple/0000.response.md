Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array \( a \).
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to \( n \) to store the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array \( a \).
   - If the current element \( a[i] \) is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element \( a[i] \) is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

5. **Output**:
   - If \( n \) is 1 or `ans` is equal to \( n \), it prints -1 (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Beautiful Array**:
   - The program only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element `tmp`. However, a beautiful array can have different patterns where elements can be made the same by the given operation, not just consecutive elements equal to the first element.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will incorrectly count the number of consecutive `1`s and not consider the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing other elements.

2. **Handling of All Elements Being the Same**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by checking if `ans` is equal to \( n \). However, it fails to handle the general case of a beautiful array with different patterns.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It only works for specific patterns and fails to handle the general case of a beautiful array.

Correctness: **False**
