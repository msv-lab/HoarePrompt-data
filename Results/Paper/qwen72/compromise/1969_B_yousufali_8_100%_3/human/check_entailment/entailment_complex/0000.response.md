### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost across multiple test cases.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function does not return any value but processes each test case as specified.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a binary string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's in the string.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
   - The function iterates through each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The logic is based on the observation that each '0' that is preceded by at least one '1' can be moved to the correct position by cyclically shifting the substring starting from the first '1' to the current '0'. The cost of each such shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost (`ans` remains 0).
   - It also handles the case where the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111") by not adding any cost (`ans` remains 0).
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string has '0's and '1's mixed (e.g., "11000") by calculating the cost as described.

6. **Input/Output Constraints**:
   - The constraints are respected: the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the total length of all strings does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
