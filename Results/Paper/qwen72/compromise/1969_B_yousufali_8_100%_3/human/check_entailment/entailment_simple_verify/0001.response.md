### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any chosen substring.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from input.
   - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string `s`:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because each '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's requires a cyclic shift of the entire sequence of '1's plus the '0' to move the '0' to the correct position.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from input.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the cost of sorting the binary string by counting the number of '1's and the positions of '0's that need to be moved.
   - The cost calculation `n + 1` for each '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's is correct because it accounts for the length of the substring that needs to be cyclically shifted.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case in `func_2`, ensuring that the solution is applied to all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") correctly by printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is entirely '1's (e.g., "1111") correctly by printing 0 since no '0's are present to disrupt the order.
   - The function correctly handles the case where '0's and '1's are mixed (e.g., "11000", "101011").

6. **Verification with Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that `s` is the input string, `n` is the count of '1's, and `ans` is the total cost.
   - The state after the loop confirms that `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is not at the beginning of the string and is preceded by at least one '1'.
   - The final print statement outputs `ans`, which is the correct total cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operation.

### Final:
**True**
