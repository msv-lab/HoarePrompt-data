### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substring.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the chosen substring.
   - The string is considered sorted if all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a binary string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's in the string, and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - The function iterates through each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero (indicating there are '1's before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the minimum cost to sort the string.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Handling of '1's and '0's**:
     - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the cost of sorting the string by counting the number of '1's and adding `n + 1` to `ans` for each '0' that is not at the beginning and is preceded by at least one '1'.
     - This is because each '0' that is preceded by '1's requires a cyclic shift to move it to the correct position, and the cost of such a shift is `n + 1` (the length of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0').
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), `ans` will be 0, which is correct.
     - If the string contains no '0's, `ans` will be 0, which is correct.
     - If the string contains no '1's, `ans` will be 0, which is correct.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**:
     - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input "10", the function correctly outputs 2.
   - For the input "0000", the function correctly outputs 0.
   - For the input "11000", the function correctly outputs 9.
   - For the input "101011", the function correctly outputs 5.
   - For the input "01101001", the function correctly outputs 11.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string is sound, and the handling of multiple test cases is appropriate.

Correctness: **True**
