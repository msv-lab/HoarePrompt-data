Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer reduced by `2 * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`, `c` is now `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 1, `l[i]` refers to the second element of the list `l`.
- The new value of `c` is the sum of its previous value (`k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`) and the added term (`l[1] * s - s * s / 2`).
- All other variables remain unchanged.
