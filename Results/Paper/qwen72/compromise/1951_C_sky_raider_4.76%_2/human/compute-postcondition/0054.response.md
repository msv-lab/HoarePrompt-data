Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 1, `l[i]` refers to the second element of the list `l`.
- The new value of `c` is the original value of `c` plus `l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`) remain unchanged.
