t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)), where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, and k is the total number of tickets to be bought. a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
