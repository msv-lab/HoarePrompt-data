Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets. Here are the issues:

1. **Sorting and Selection of Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of prices `M` and selects the first `q` elements, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. This approach assumes that the cheapest days should be chosen, which is correct.
   - However, the program does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to the tickets purchased on previous days.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost in two parts:
     - If `n * m == k`, it calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - If `n * m != k`, it calculates the cost as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.
   - The formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is incorrect. This formula is intended to account for the additional cost due to the price increases, but it does not correctly model the price increases.

3. **Price Increases**:
   - The price increase for each subsequent day should be based on the number of tickets purchased on the previous days. The program does not correctly handle this.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Sort the prices in ascending order.
2. Use a greedy approach to buy tickets on the cheapest days first.
3. Keep track of the number of tickets bought and the total cost, while adjusting the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_buy_tickets(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, m, k, prices in test_cases:
        prices.sort()
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        day = 0
        
        while tickets_bought < k:
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * (prices[day] + tickets_bought)
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            day += 1
        
        results.append(total_cost)
    
    return results

# Reading input
t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, m, k, prices))

# Getting results
results = min_cost_to_buy_tickets(t, test_cases)

# Printing results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sorting Prices**: The prices are sorted in ascending order to ensure that we buy tickets on the cheapest days first.
2. **Greedy Approach**: We use a while loop to buy tickets on the cheapest days until we have bought `k` tickets.
3. **Price Adjustment**: For each day, the price is adjusted by adding the number of tickets already bought to the original price of the day.
4. **Total Cost Calculation**: The total cost is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.

This approach ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly by accounting for the price increases due to the tickets purchased on previous days.
