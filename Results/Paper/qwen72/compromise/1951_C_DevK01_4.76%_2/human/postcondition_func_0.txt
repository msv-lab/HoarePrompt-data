The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a` for each day. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days. The function does not return any value; it only prints the cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
