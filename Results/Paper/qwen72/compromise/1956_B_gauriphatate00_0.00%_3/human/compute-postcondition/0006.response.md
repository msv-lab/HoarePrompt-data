The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string**
