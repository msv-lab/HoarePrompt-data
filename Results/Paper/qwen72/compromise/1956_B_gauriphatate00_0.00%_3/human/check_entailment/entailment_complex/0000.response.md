Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of cards each player has) and `a` (a list of integers representing the cards in the player's hand).
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) by counting how many integers appear exactly twice in the list `a`.
   - It returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

   The logic here is that the player can score a point for each pair of cards they have, but they can only play `n // 2` turns where they can score a point. Therefore, the maximum number of points the player can score is the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`.

   The function correctly handles the input format and processes each test case as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the results are computed and printed for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining the maximum number of points the player can score.
   - The program does not modify the input and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
