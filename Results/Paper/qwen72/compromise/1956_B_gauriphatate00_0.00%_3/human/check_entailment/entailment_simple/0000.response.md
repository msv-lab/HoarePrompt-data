Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of cards each player has) and `a` (the list of integers on your cards).
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) by summing up the number of integers that appear exactly twice.
   - Finally, it returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

   This logic is correct because:
   - The number of pairs you can form with your cards is the number of integers that appear exactly twice.
   - Since you and Nene each take `n` turns, you can only score points for up to `n // 2` pairs (since each pair can only be matched once, and you and Nene take turns).

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads all input data at once and processes it.
   - It initializes `t` (the number of test cases) and an empty list `results` to store the results of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cards each player has) and the list `a` (the integers on your cards).
   - It calls `func_1` with `n` and `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

   This logic is also correct because:
   - It correctly reads and processes the input data.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct order.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided as comments, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, considering that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Correctness: **True**
