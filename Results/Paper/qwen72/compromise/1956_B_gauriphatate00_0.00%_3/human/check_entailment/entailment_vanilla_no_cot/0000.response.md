Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
   - **Logic**:
     - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
     - It then counts how many pairs of cards you have (i.e., cards that appear exactly twice in your hand).
     - The maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and half the number of cards you have (`n // 2`), because you can only score points if Nene has already placed a card with the same number on the table, and you can only place up to `n // 2` cards in your turns.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input data.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of cards `a` in your hand.
     - It calls `func_1` to calculate the result for the current test case and appends it to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

The logic in both functions aligns with the problem requirements, and the program handles multiple test cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
