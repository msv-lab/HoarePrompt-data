To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `l` and `r`.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15
- `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9
- `l` is 0
- `r` is n - 1
- `sunks` is 0

The loop condition is `while l <= r`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l <= r` must be true.

Let's analyze the given state:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is n - 1

Since `n` is a positive integer and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, then `r` is 0. Therefore, `l` (0) is always less than or equal to `r` (n - 1) for any valid `n`.

Given this, the loop condition `l <= r` will always be true for the first iteration, and no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0**
