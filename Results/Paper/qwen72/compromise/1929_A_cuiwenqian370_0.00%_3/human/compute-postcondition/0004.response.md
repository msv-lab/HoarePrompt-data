The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`. The loop condition is `left <= right`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute the first time, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, and `n` is at least 2, `right` will always be greater than or equal to `left` (since `n - 1` is at least 1).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
