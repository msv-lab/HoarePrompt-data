The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is already given as an integer provided by the user, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
