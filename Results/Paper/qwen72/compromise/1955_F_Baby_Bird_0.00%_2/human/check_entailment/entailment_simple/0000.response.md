### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by removing numbers optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 3s, and the total number of 2s and 4s (since 2 XOR 2 = 0 and 4 XOR 4 = 0) are all even.
   - Removing a number from the sequence changes the parity of the count of that number.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as many times as possible by removing numbers.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then modifies the list `p` by subtracting the remainder when each element is divided by 2, effectively making each count even.
   - The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` is used to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`:
     - This line converts the input counts to even numbers by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2.
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`:
     - This checks if the first three elements of the original list `p` (counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s) were all odd.
     - If they were all odd, the initial sequence has an odd number of 1s, 3s, and an even number of 2s and 4s, which means the initial XOR is non-zero, and Bob wins once.
   - `sum(p) // 2`:
     - This calculates the total number of pairs of numbers that can be removed, which is the sum of the even counts divided by 2.
     - Each pair of numbers (either two 1s, two 3s, or one 2 and one 4) will make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win is sound:
     - If the initial counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, Bob wins once.
     - The remaining even counts are divided by 2 to determine the number of pairs that can be removed, each pair contributing to a win for Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
