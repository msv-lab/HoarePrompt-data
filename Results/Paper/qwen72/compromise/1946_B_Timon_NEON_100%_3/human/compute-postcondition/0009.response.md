To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `segment` and `segments_variants`.

- `segments_variants` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute at least once.
- The `segment` variable will take the value of the first element in `segments_variants` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `new_segment` is an empty list.
- `max_segment` is [sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`].
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers and the start and end indices of that segment, and the last sublist in `segments_variants` is `[sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1, len(arr) - 1]`.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- `total_max_segment` is [-1].

To ensure the loop executes:
- `segments_variants` must have at least one element.
- `segment` will be the first element of `segments_variants`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least one element, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1], `segment` is the first element in `segments_variants`**
