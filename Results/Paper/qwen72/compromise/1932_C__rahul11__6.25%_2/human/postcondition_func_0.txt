The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of `n` integers `arr` (1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^4), and a string `s` of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a list `res` of `n` integers. The first element of `res` is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. Subsequent elements in `res` are calculated by iteratively dividing the current product by the corresponding element in `arr` based on the direction specified by `s` ('L' or 'R'), and then taking the result modulo `m` and `10^9 + 6`. The function prints the list `res` for each test case.
