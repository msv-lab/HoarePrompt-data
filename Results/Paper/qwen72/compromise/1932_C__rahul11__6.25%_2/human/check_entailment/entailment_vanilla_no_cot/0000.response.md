Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Modulo Operation Misuse**: The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` and applies it in the calculation of `ans`. However, the problem description does not require any modulo operation other than the one with `m`. The use of `MOD` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Division in Modulo Arithmetic**: The program uses integer division (`//`) to remove elements from the product. However, in modular arithmetic, division is not straightforward and can lead to incorrect results if the divisor is not a modular inverse of the element being removed. For example, `ans // arr[l] % m` is not the correct way to remove an element from the product in modular arithmetic.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product calculation should be done modulo `m` to avoid overflow issues, especially since the product of large numbers can exceed the limits of standard integer types.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should be a single line of integers for each test case, but the program prints the results correctly in this aspect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(1, n):
            if s[k-1] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], m-2, m)) % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], m-2, m)) % m
                r -= 1
            res[k] = ans
        print(*res)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product is calculated modulo `m` to avoid overflow.
2. **Modular Inverse for Division**: To remove an element from the product, we use the modular inverse of the element. The modular inverse of `a` modulo `m` is `a^(m-2) % m` (by Fermat's Little Theorem, assuming `m` is a prime number). This ensures that the division is correctly handled in modular arithmetic.
3. **Output Format**: The output format remains correct, printing the results for each test case on a single line.

This corrected program should now handle the problem description correctly.
