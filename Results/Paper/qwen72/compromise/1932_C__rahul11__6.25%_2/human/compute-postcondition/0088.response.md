Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]`, `res[1]`, and `res[2]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 2 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`, `c` is 3, `k` is 2, `res[3]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- `c` is 3, so `res[3]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
