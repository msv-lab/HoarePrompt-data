Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]`, `res[1]`, and `res[2]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 3 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`, `c` is 3, `k` is 2, `res[3]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**
