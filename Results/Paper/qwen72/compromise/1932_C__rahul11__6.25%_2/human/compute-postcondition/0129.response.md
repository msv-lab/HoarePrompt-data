Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1.
- The value of `c` is increased by 1.
- The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` is greater than 2 remains valid.
