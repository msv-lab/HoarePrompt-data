Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `res[1]` is also set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` except `arr[l]`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `res[1]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` except the last one, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. In both cases, `k` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 1.**
