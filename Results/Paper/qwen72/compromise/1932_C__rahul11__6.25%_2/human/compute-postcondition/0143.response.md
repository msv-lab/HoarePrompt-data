Output State: **`k` is `n - 1`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration, and `ans` is the final value after all divisions and modulo operations.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`k` is `n - 1`**: The loop runs `n - 1` times, so after all iterations, `k` will be `n - 1`.
- **`c` is `n`**: The variable `c` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration. After `n - 1` iterations, `c` will be `n`.
- **`l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`**: Each time the loop encounters an 'L' in the string `s`, `l` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `l` will be the total number of 'L' characters in `s`.
- **`r` is `n - 1 - l`**: Since `r` starts at `n - 1` and is decremented by 1 each time the loop encounters a character other than 'L' (i.e., 'R'), `r` will be `n - 1 - l` after all iterations.
- **`res` is a list of `n` integers**: The list `res` is updated in each iteration, and after `n - 1` iterations, it will have `n` elements. Each element `res[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be the result of `ans % m % MOD` after the corresponding iteration.
- **`ans` is the final value after all divisions and modulo operations**: The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration based on the character in `s` and the corresponding element in `arr`. After all iterations, `ans` will be the final value after all the divisions and modulo operations.
