The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * i`. Given that `ans` is `i * i` or `i^2` and `i` is the third integer in the list `arr`, the new value of `ans` will be `i * i * i` or `i^3`.

Output State: **`_` is 3, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least 3 integers, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers, each initialized to 0, `ans` is `i^3`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` from the beginning to `n-2`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `c` is `n`, `k` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `arr`.**
