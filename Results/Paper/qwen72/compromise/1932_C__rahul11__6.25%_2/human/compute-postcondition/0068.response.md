Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[l]`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `c` is 1, `k` is 0, and `s[k]` is 'L'.**

The value of `ans` is updated to the integer division of `ans` by `arr[l]` (which is `arr[0]`), and then the result is taken modulo `MOD`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
