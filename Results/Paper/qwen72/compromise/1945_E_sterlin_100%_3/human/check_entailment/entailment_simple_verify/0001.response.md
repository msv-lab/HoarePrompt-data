### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - After rearranging, we perform a binary search to find `x`.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search on a Permutation:**
   - The binary search algorithm in the problem initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`.
   - It continues until `r - l = 1`.
   - It calculates the middle index `m` as `m = (r + l) // 2`.
   - If `p_m <= x`, it updates `l` to `m`, otherwise it updates `r` to `m`.

3. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to ensure that the binary search can still find `x` even though the array is not sorted.
   - We need to place `x` in a position where the binary search will eventually find it.
   - The binary search will always end with `l` being the index where `x` should be if the array were sorted.

4. **Algorithm to Solve the Problem:**
   - For each test case, we need to find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - We then need to ensure that `x` is in a position that will be found by the binary search.
   - If `x` is already in the correct position, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not in the correct position, we can swap it into the correct position using at most 2 swaps.

5. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The provided program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to read input.
   - The main logic of the program is as follows:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `p`.
     - It creates a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index.
     - It initializes `seen` to keep track of which elements have been "seen" during the binary search.
     - It performs a binary search to find the position `left` where `x` should be.
     - If `p[left] == x`, it prints 0 (no swaps needed).
     - If `x` is not in the correct position and has not been "seen", it prints 1 and the swap needed to place `x` in the correct position.
     - If `x` is not in the correct position and has been "seen", it prints 2 and the swaps needed to place `x` in the correct position.

6. **Evaluation of the Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly, although the initial values of `left` and `right` are set to 0 and `n` respectively, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - The program correctly identifies the position where `x` should be found after the binary search.
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `x` is already in the correct position, needs one swap, or needs two swaps.
   - The logic for determining the swaps is sound and follows the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect. The provided program does implement the necessary logic to solve the problem, including reading input, performing binary search, and determining the required swaps. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
