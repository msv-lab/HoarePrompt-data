### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - After rearranging, we perform a binary search to find `x`.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search on a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works on sorted arrays. However, in this problem, we are applying it to a permutation.
   - The binary search algorithm in the problem is slightly different from the standard binary search:
     - It initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
     - It continues until `r - l = 1`.
     - It calculates the middle index `m` as `m = (r + l) // 2`.
     - If `p_m <= x`, it updates `l` to `m`, otherwise it updates `r` to `m`.

3. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to ensure that the binary search can still find `x` even though the array is not sorted.
   - We need to place `x` in a position where the binary search will eventually find it.
   - The binary search will always end with `l` being the index where `x` should be if the array were sorted.

4. **Algorithm to Solve the Problem:**
   - For each test case, we need to find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - We then need to ensure that `x` is in a position that will be found by the binary search.
   - If `x` is already in the correct position, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not in the correct position, we can swap it into the correct position using at most 2 swaps.

5. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The provided program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to read input.
   - However, the program does not contain any logic to solve the problem. It only reads input and does not perform any swaps or binary search.
   - Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. It only reads input and does not perform the necessary swaps or binary search to find the number `x` in the permutation.
