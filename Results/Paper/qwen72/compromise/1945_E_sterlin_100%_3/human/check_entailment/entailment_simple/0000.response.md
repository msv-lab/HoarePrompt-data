Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the permutation size and target value, and the permutation itself using the provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. These functions are designed to handle the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Permutation Index Mapping**: The program creates a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index. This is necessary for identifying the positions of elements to swap.

3. **Binary Search Setup**: The program initializes `left` and `right` for the binary search. The binary search is set up to run until `left + 1 < right`, which is a standard condition for binary search to avoid infinite loops.

4. **Binary Search Loop**: Inside the loop, the program calculates the middle index `mid` and updates the `seen` array to mark the elements that have been considered. It then adjusts `left` or `right` based on the comparison of `p[mid]` with `x`.

5. **Post-Search Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the element at `p[left]` is equal to `x`. If it is, the program outputs 0, indicating no swaps were needed.

6. **Single Swap Case**: If the target `x` is not seen in the `seen` array, the program outputs 1 and the indices to swap the target `x` with the element at `left`.

7. **Double Swap Case**: If the target `x` is seen in the `seen` array but not at `left`, the program outputs 2 and the indices to swap the target `x` and another unseen element to ensure the target is at the correct position.

8. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the target `x` is already in the correct position or can be moved to the correct position with one or two swaps.

9. **Correctness of Swaps**: The logic for determining the swaps is correct. It first checks if the target is already in the correct position, then if a single swap can place it correctly, and finally, if two swaps are needed to place it correctly.

10. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem description, providing the number of swaps and the indices for each swap.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
