The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is provided by the user and it is expected to be an integer value between 1 and 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which is the initial state for the loop variable.

State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
