Output State: **`win_with_swap` will be the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` from the initial `win_with_swap` position up to the point where an element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `k-1` if no such element is found. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
