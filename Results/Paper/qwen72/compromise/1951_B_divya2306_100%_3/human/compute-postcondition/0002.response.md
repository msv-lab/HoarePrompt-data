Output State: **The function still takes three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k, and a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. However, `n` and `k` are now specific integers provided by the user input, and the input format is expected to be two space-separated integers. `a` is a list of integers read from user input. `wins` is 0.**
