### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of 2n integers.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The function initializes two lists `l` and `r` of length `n` to count the occurrences of each integer in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - It correctly updates these counts by iterating through the first half and the second half of `a`.

3. **Printing Pairs from the First Half**:
   - The function prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice, until `k` pairs are printed or no more such pairs are available.
   - The variable `ul` is used to keep track of the number of elements printed from the first half.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - If additional unique elements are needed to reach a total of `2k` elements, it prints single elements from the first half of `a` and stores them in the list `res`.
   - The variable `re` is used to keep track of the number of additional elements printed.

5. **Printing Elements from the Second Half**:
   - The function then prints the remaining elements from the second half of `a` that were not fully printed in pairs.
   - The variable `ur` is used to keep track of the number of elements printed from the second half.

6. **Ensuring XOR Equality**:
   - The function does not explicitly check if the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal, but it attempts to print pairs and single elements in a way that should ensure the XOR condition is met.
   - However, the logic for ensuring the XOR condition is not robust. The function only prints pairs and single elements without ensuring that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the XOR condition might not be met by the current logic. For example, if the first half of `a` does not contain enough pairs or single elements to satisfy the condition, the function might print incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The function does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal. The logic for selecting elements from the first and second halves of `a` is not sufficient to ensure the XOR condition is always met, even though it is stated that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists.

**Correctness: False**
