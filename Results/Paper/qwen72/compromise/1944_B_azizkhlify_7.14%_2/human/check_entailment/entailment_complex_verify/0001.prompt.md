You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values. The variables `l` and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element represents the count of the corresponding integer in the first and second halves of the list `a`, respectively. The variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are updated to reflect the number of elements printed from the first and second halves of the list `a`. The list `res` contains the elements printed from the first half of the list `a` that were not fully printed in pairs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice, until `k` pairs are printed or no more such pairs are available. If additional unique elements are needed to reach a total of `k` pairs, it prints single elements from the first half of `a`. It then prints the remaining elements from the second half of `a` that were not fully printed in pairs. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values, while `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are updated to reflect the counts and the number of elements printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` with zeros. These arrays are intended to keep track of the frequency of each element in the first half and the second half of the array `a`.

3. **Frequency Count:**
   - The program counts the frequency of each element in the first half of `a` and stores it in `l`.
   - It then counts the frequency of each element in the second half of `a` and stores it in `r`.

4. **Constructing the Subsets:**
   - The program initializes variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to zero. These variables are used to keep track of the number of elements selected for the subsets.
   - It then iterates through the first half of `a` to find elements that appear exactly twice in the first half and prints them. This ensures that the subset `l` is constructed with elements from the first half.
   - If the required number of elements for `l` is not yet reached, it continues to find elements that appear exactly once in the first half and prints them. These elements are also stored in the list `res`.

5. **Printing the First Subset:**
   - The program prints the elements of the first subset `l`.

6. **Constructing the Second Subset:**
   - The program then iterates through the second half of `a` to find elements that appear exactly twice in the second half and prints them. This ensures that the subset `r` is constructed with elements from the second half.
   - If the required number of elements for `r` is not yet reached, it uses the elements stored in `res` to complete the subset `r`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of the second subset `r`.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Frequency Counting:**
  - The program correctly counts the frequency of elements in the first and second halves of `a`.
- **Subset Construction:**
  - The program correctly constructs the subset `l` by selecting elements that appear exactly twice in the first half, and if needed, elements that appear exactly once.
  - However, the program does not correctly handle the construction of the subset `r` to ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` and `r` are equal.
  - The program only prints elements that appear exactly twice in the second half, and if needed, elements from `res`. This approach does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` will be equal.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` might not be equal due to the way it constructs the subsets.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` and `r` are equal, which is a crucial requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
