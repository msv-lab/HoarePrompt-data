Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n â‰¥ 1), `i` is `n-1`, `first` is True if there exists at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is encountered before the loop breaks, otherwise `first` is False.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`first`**: The variable `first` is initially set to `False`. It will be set to `True` the first time the loop encounters an integer in `arr` that appears exactly once (`mpp[i] == 1`). If no such integer is found, `first` will remain `False`.

The loop will break early if:
- `i` is not a key in `mpp` (i.e., `i` is not in `arr`).
- `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is `True` (i.e., a unique integer has been encountered before, and another unique integer is found).

If neither of these conditions is met, the loop will run to completion, and the final state will be as described above.
