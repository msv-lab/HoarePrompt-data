Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 0 in the initial state, the `print` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
