Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `n` is a positive integer where \( n \geq 3 \).
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of `i`.

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 2, the `print` statement will output the value 2.

Output: **2**
