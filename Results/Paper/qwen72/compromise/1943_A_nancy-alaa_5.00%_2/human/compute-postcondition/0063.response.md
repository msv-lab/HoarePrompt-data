Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`, and `first` is True.
- Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: The initial state explicitly states that `i` is 2.
2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`. If this is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, but this does not affect the value of `i`.
   - The second condition checks if `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1. If this is true, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`, and `first` is set to True.
   - The third condition is a catch-all, stating that if neither of the above conditions is true, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`.

3. **Execution of `print(i)`**:
   - Regardless of the conditions, the value of `i` remains 2.
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
