Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`, and `first` is True. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`.***
