Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and returns the total cost calculated by counting the number of '0's that appear after a '1' in the string, with each '0' contributing `one + 1` to the cost, where `one` is the number of '1's encountered before each '0'. The input string `s` remains unchanged. **
