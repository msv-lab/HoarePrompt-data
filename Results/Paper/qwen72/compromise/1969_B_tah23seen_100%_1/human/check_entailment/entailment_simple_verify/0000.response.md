Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. The function `func_1` does handle the case where the string is already sorted, and it correctly returns 0 for such cases. Let's break down the function to understand why:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - `one` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop through the string**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment `one` by 1.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, add `one + 1` to `cost`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost is incremented only when a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's. This is because the condition `elif i == '0' and one > 0` ensures that the cost is only added when there are '1's before the '0'.
   - If the string is already sorted (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's), the `one` variable will never be greater than 0 when a '0' is encountered, and thus the cost will remain 0.

4. **Examples**:
   - For the string "0000", the function will return 0 because there are no '1's before any '0'.
   - For the string "1111", the function will return 0 because there are no '0's in the string.
   - For the string "11000", the function will correctly calculate the cost as 9, as described in the problem note.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the string is already sorted.
   - The function also handles the case where the string is entirely composed of '1's or '0's, returning 0 in both scenarios.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` is indeed correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
