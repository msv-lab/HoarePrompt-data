Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on the number of '1's that appear before a '0' in the string, but it does not account for the optimal way to sort the string using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost calculation is incorrect and does not match the expected output for the given examples.

For example, in the test case `101011`, the program would calculate a cost of 5, which is correct, but the logic is flawed and would not work for more complex cases. The correct approach should consider the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to bring all '1's to the end of the string, which can be more efficiently calculated by finding the longest contiguous segment of '1's and using that to determine the minimum cost.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Finding the longest contiguous segment of '1's in the string.
2. Calculating the cost based on the length of the string and the position of this segment.

The provided program does not implement this logic, and thus, it is incorrect.
