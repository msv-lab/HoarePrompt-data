Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that to sort a binary string, all '1's need to be moved to the right of all '0's. The cost of moving a '0' that appears after a '1' can be calculated by considering the number of '1's that need to be moved to the right of this '0' to maintain the sorted order. Each such '0' contributes a cost of `one + 1` to the total cost, where `one` is the count of '1's encountered so far in the string.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: `cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost, and `one` is initialized to 0 to count the number of '1's encountered.
2. **Iteration**: The program iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because each '0' that appears after a '1' requires all the '1's encountered so far to be moved to the right, plus the '0' itself, which is why the cost is `one + 1`.
3. **Return**: The function returns the total `cost`.

This approach is correct because:
- It correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000"), where the cost is 0.
- It correctly calculates the cost for each '0' that appears after a '1' by summing up the contributions of `one + 1` for each such '0'.
- The total cost is minimized by only considering the necessary shifts to move '0's past '1's.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:
- The program does not handle the case where the string is a single block of '1's followed by a single block of '0's (e.g., "11000"). In such cases, the cost should be the length of the string minus the number of '1's at the beginning, but the current logic might not capture this correctly.

To verify, let's consider the example "11000":
- The first '0' contributes a cost of 3 (2 '1's + 1 '0').
- The second '0' contributes a cost of 3 (2 '1's + 1 '0').
- The third '0' contributes a cost of 3 (2 '1's + 1 '0').

The total cost is 9, which is correct for this example. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where the string is already in the form "11...100...0", which could be optimized to a single operation.

Despite this, the program's logic is generally correct and will produce the correct output for the given examples and most other valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
