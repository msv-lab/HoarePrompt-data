Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary.**

The initial state variables `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged. The new variable `count` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
