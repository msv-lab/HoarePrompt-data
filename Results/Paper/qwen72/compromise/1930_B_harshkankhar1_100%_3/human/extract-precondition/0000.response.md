Precondition: **The function should take a single integer n as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and n is the length of the permutation p.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
```

With the precondition:

**n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**
