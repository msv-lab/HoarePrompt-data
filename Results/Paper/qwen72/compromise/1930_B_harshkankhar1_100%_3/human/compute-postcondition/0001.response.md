The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `a`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
2. **Code Execution**: The slice `a[::2]` selects elements at even indices of `a`. The slice `a[::2][::-1]` reverses these selected elements. The reversed elements are then assigned back to the even indices of `a`.

### Calculation:
- If `n` is 3, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`. The even indices are 0 and 2. Reversing these gives `[3, 2, 1]`.
- If `n` is 4, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The even indices are 0 and 2. Reversing these gives `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
- If `n` is 5, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The even indices are 0, 2, and 4. Reversing these gives `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- If `n` is 6, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The even indices are 0, 2, and 4. Reversing these gives `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

### General Pattern:
- The elements at even indices of `a` are reversed, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.
- The first element of the reversed even indices will be the last even-indexed element of the original list, and so on.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where the elements at even indices are reversed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where the elements at even indices are reversed.**
