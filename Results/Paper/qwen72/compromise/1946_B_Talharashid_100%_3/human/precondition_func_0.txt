The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and an integer `k` representing the number of operations. The list `a` contains integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, and `n` and `k` are within the range 1 to 2 \cdot 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 \le t \le 10^4).
