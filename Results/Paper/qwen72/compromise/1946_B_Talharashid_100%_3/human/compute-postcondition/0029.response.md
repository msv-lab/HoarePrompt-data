Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user, and both must be greater than 1.**
