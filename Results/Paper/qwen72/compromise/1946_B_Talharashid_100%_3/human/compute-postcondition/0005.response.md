The only objects in the loop head are `ele` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list `l` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is 0. For the loop to execute, `l` must have at least one element, and `ele` should be the first element in the list `l`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`**
