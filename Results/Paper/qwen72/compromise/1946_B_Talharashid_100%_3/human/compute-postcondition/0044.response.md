Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` remains the maximum value between `ele` and 0.**
