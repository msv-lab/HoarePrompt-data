Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is a negative integer and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is set to the maximum value between `ele` and 0, and `c` is updated to `c + ele`. `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.***
