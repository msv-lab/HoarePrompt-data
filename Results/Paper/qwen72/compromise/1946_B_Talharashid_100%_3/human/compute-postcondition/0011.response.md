Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `c` is `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and either `ele` is greater than or equal to 0, or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. Given that `c` is `ele` and `maxi` is 0, `maxi` will now be the maximum of `ele` and 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
