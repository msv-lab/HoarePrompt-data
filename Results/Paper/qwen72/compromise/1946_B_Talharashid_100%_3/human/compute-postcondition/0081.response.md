Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last non-negative integer before a negative integer that resets `c` to 0, and `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `l` remains the same as it is the input list and is not modified by the loop.
- `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last non-negative integer before a negative integer that resets `c` to 0. This means that if there are any negative integers in the list, `c` will be reset to 0 after each negative integer, and it will accumulate the sum of the subsequent non-negative integers.
- `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution. This means that `maxi` will store the highest sum of non-negative integers encountered before any negative integer resets `c` to 0. If no negative integers are present, `maxi` will be the sum of all elements in the list. If the list contains only negative integers, `maxi` will be 0.
