Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0.***
