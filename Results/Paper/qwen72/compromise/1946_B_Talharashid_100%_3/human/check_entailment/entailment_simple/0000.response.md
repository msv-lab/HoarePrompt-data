### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`, followed by the array `l`.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `c` and `maxi` are initialized to 0. `c` is used to keep track of the current sum of a contiguous subarray, and `maxi` is used to store the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found so far.

3. **Loop for Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the array `l`.
   - If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, it means that adding `ele` to `c` would make `c` negative or zero. In this case, the function updates `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and `maxi` and resets `c` to 0.
   - If `ele` is non-negative, it adds `ele` to `c` and updates `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

4. **Final Update of `maxi`**: After the loop, `maxi` is updated one last time to ensure it contains the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found.

5. **Calculation of Result**:
   - The function calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula is intended to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. The idea is to repeatedly add the maximum subarray sum `maxi` to the array, which is achieved by multiplying `maxi` by `2 ** k` and then subtracting `maxi` to avoid double-counting the initial `maxi` in the array.
   - The result is then taken modulo `1000000007` to handle large numbers.

6. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is derived from the idea that the maximum sum of the array can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum `maxi` to the array.
- The term `2 ** k * maxi` represents the sum of the maximum subarray added `k` times.
- The term `- maxi` is subtracted to avoid counting the initial `maxi` in the array.
- The term `sum(l)` is added to account for the initial sum of the array.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case with Negative Sums**: The logic for handling negative sums in the array is correct, but the formula might not handle cases where all elements in the array are negative correctly. In such cases, the maximum subarray sum `maxi` should be 0, but the current logic might not ensure this.
- **Efficiency**: The function is efficient for the given constraints, as it processes each test case in linear time with respect to the length of the array `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but it might not handle edge cases where all elements in the array are negative correctly. To ensure correctness, we should initialize `maxi` to the maximum of 0 and the initial `maxi`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To handle the edge case where all elements in the array are negative, we should initialize `maxi` to the maximum of 0 and the initial `maxi`.

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = 0
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        maxi = max(c, maxi, 0)  # Ensure maxi is at least 0
        
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

With this fix, the program should correctly handle all edge cases and produce the correct output.
