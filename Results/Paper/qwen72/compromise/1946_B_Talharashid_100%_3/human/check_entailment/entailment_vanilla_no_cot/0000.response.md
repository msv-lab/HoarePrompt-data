Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a fundamental flaw in its logic for calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing k operations. The approach taken in the function `func()` is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then use this to calculate the final result. However, this approach does not correctly account for the nature of the operations, which allow the sum of any contiguous subarray to be inserted into the array multiple times.

The correct approach should consider the following:
1. The maximum possible sum after k operations can be achieved by repeatedly inserting the sum of the entire array, which is the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.
2. If the sum of the entire array is negative, the best strategy is to insert the sum of the largest positive contiguous subarray (or zero if all elements are negative) to avoid decreasing the total sum.
3. If the sum of the entire array is non-negative, the best strategy is to insert the sum of the entire array k times.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_sum = sum(l)
        max_subarray_sum = max(0, max(sum(l[i:j]) for i in range(n) for j in range(i + 1, n + 1)))
        
        if total_sum > 0:
            result = (total_sum * (2 ** k - 1)) % 1000000007
        else:
            result = (max_subarray_sum * k) % 1000000007
        
        print(result)

```

Explanation:
1. **total_sum**: Calculate the sum of the entire array.
2. **max_subarray_sum**: Calculate the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, ensuring it is at least 0 (to handle cases where all elements are negative).
3. If the total sum of the array is positive, the optimal strategy is to insert the total sum \( k \) times, which results in the total sum being multiplied by \( 2^k - 1 \).
4. If the total sum is non-positive, the optimal strategy is to insert the maximum subarray sum \( k \) times.

This corrected approach ensures that the maximum possible sum is calculated correctly for all test cases.
