### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads an integer `n` and generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This is a valid permutation of length `n`.

3. **Reversing Even Indices**:
   - The program then reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a` using the slice operation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`. This operation reverses the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc. (0-based indexing).

4. **Output**:
   - The modified list `a` is printed as a space-separated sequence of integers.

5. **Validation**:
   - The goal is to ensure that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are no longer in their original order, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 4`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
     - Check: `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`, and `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 4`.
   - For `n = 5`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
     - Check: `p_1 = 5` does not divide `p_3 = 3`, and `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 4`.

7. **General Case**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will have elements from 1 to `n` in some order. Reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the original order is disrupted, making it less likely for the divisibility condition to hold for any two distinct indices `i` and `j`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation of length `n` and ensures that the divisibility condition is not met for any two distinct indices `i` and `j`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
