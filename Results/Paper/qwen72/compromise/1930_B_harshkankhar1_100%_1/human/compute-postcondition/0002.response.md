Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, but the elements at even indices of `a` are now reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`. The elements at odd indices remain unchanged. The value of `n` is not affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `a` with its even-indexed elements reversed, while `n` retains its original value within the specified range.
