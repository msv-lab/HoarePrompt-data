The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the problem statement mentions a constraint `3 <= n <= 10^5`, which suggests that `n` is an integer within this range. Since `n` is not passed as a parameter, it might be a global variable or defined within the function. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
