Output State: **a, b, and c remain unchanged, but the loop prints a series of values based on the condition (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3] for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop reads lines from the input, starting from the second line (skipping the first line).
- For each line, it splits the line into three integers and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then updates `b` by adding `c` to it.
- The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is evaluated and printed:
  - If `c` is less than `b % 3`, the loop prints `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `a - -b // 3`, which simplifies to `a + b // 3`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are reset to the values read from the next line in each iteration, so they do not retain any state from previous iterations.
- After the loop finishes, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the same as their initial values, as they are overwritten in each iteration.
