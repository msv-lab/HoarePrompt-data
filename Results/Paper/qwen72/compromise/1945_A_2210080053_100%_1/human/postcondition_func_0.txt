The function `func` reads lines from standard input (excluding the first line), where each line contains three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each line, it calculates a value based on the formula `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` and prints this value. The function does not modify the input variables `a`, `b`, and `c` and does not return any value.
