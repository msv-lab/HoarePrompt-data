### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.
   - This part of the program is correct.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - For each test case, it splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, s.split())`.
   - This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b` with the line `b += c`.
   - This adjustment is made because universals can be used to fill the tents that extroverts require.
   - This part of the program is correct.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - The program then calculates the number of tents needed using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - Let's break down this expression:
     - `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
     - `-b // 3` ensures that the division is performed with floor division, and the negative sign is used to handle the floor division correctly for negative numbers. However, in this context, `b` is always non-negative, so `-b // 3` is equivalent to `b // 3`.
     - `a - -b // 3` calculates the total number of tents needed by subtracting the number of full tents from the number of introverts. This is incorrect because it should be `a + b // 3` to account for the total number of tents required.
     - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is a conditional expression that checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts. If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Expression:
- **Correctness of `b // 3`:**
  - This correctly calculates the number of full tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
- **Correctness of `a - -b // 3`:**
  - This is incorrect. The correct expression should be `a + b // 3` because introverts always need their own tent, and the number of full tents for extroverts and universals should be added to the number of introverts.
- **Correctness of the Conditional Expression:**
  - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the total number of tents. The correct expression should be `(a + b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `0` because no participants mean no tents are needed.
- **When `a > 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `a` because each introvert needs their own tent.
- **When `a = 0`, `b > 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` because there are no universals to fill the tents required by extroverts.
- **When `a = 0`, `b > 0`, and `c > 0`:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of tents needed and checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts, but the calculation of the total number of tents is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the total number of tents needed. The expression `a - -b // 3` should be `a + b // 3` to account for the total number of tents required for introverts and the full tents for extroverts and universals.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
