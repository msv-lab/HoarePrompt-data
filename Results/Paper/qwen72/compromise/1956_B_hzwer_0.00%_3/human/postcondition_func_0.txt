The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `cards` from user input. It then computes and returns the maximum number of pairs of cards that can be matched based on the rules provided, considering the initial state of the cards. The function uses a dynamic programming table `dp` to store intermediate results, which is updated according to the count of each card value in `cards`. The final state of the program is that `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of pairs that can be matched, and this value is returned.
