Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is n - 1, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is exactly 1.**
