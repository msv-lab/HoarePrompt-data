Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` which are updated based on the count of `n - 2` in `cards`. If `n - 2` is not present in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to 0 and `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`. If `n - 2` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`. If `n - 2` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n]`, and `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`. `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`. If `n - 2` is not present in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is equal to `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`. If `n - 2` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`. If `n - 2` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`.**
