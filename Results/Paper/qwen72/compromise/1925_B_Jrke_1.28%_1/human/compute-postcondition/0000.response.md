The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of the `range(int(input()))` function. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables `t`, `x`, and `n` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
