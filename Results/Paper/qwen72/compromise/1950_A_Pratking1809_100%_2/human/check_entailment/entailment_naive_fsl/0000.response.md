Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It checks if the digits form a stair (a < b < c), a peak (a < b > c), or neither, and prints the appropriate output for each test case. The logic is straightforward and covers all edge cases, including when the digits are equal (e.g., 0 0 0), which correctly outputs "NONE". Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
