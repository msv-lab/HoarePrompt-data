You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; q is an input integer. The loop has printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the values of a, b, and c.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `q` times, which is correct for handling multiple test cases.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is appropriate as the input format specifies that the digits are space-separated.
4. **Conditional Checks**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correctly implemented.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback for the given problem.
5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles the input and output as required.

Correctness: **True**
