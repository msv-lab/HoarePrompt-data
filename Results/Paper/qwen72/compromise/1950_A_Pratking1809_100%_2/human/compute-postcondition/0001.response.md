To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it explicitly. However, for the loop to start, `q` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
