The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `ii` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of `n` characters, each character is either 'L' or 'R'.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The loop will execute based on the input value. To ensure the loop executes at least once, the input value must be greater than 0. The variable `ii` will start at 0 and will be incremented by 1 for each iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
