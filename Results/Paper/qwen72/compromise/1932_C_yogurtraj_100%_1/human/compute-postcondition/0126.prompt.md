Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is -1. If the last character of `t` is 'L', `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l`, and `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`. Otherwise, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `k` is `a[l] % m`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `y[i]` is `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`, and `k` is `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `k` is `(a[l] % m) * a[l + 1] % m`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `k` is `k * a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', otherwise the last character of `t` is 'L' and `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `y[i]` is `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q2` is `l + 3`, and `k` is `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `k` is `(a[l] % m) * a[l + 1] % m`. After executing the code, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is `l - 3`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `k` is `k * a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', otherwise `k` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 4`, `y[i]` is `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
