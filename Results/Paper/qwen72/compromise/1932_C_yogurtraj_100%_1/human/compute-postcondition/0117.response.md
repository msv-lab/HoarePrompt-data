Postcondition: ***`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `y[i]` is `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q2` is `l + 3`, and `k` is `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `k` is `(a[l] % m) * a[l + 1] % m`. After executing the code, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `q1` is `l - 3`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `k` is `k * a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', otherwise `k` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`.***
