Postcondition: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated based on the condition: if `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q2] % m` where `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`; if `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q1] % m` where `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`. `q1` is updated to `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`. `q2` is updated to `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`. `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is the updated value of `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 2`.**
