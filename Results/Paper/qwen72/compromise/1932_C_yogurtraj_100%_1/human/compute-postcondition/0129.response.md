The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is expected to accept multiple parameters. These parameters include:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the length of the list `a` and the string `s`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
  - `m`: An integer, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
  - `s`: A string of `n` characters, each character being either 'L' or 'R'.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Assuming the function processes the inputs and returns a result for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `m`, a list of integers `a` of length `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'L' or 'R'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
