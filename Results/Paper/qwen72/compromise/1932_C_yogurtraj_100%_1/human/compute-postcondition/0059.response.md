Output State: **`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to 0. If the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.**
