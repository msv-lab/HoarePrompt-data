Output State: **`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k`, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 2`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` is `k * a[l + 1] % m`.**

The value of `q2` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `l + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
