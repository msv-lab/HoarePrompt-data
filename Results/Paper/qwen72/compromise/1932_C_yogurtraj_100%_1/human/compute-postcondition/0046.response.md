Output State: **`t` remains the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is the final value after all iterations, `q1` is the final value after all iterations, `q2` is the final value after all iterations, and `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element from index 0 to `n-2` is the updated value of `k` at each iteration, and the last element is the final value of `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers derived from the input string provided by `input()`.
- The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
