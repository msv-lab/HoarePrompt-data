Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `possible` is False, and the current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
