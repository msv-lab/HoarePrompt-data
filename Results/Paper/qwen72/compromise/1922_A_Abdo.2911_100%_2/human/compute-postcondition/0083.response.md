Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is True if at any point during the loop, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `n` is the input integer, which determines the number of iterations.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- The variable `i` is set to `n - 1`, indicating the final index of the loop.
- The variable `possible` is set to True if, at any iteration, the character at the same index in `a` and `b` is the same and the character in `c` at that index is different, or if the characters in `a` and `b` are different and the character in `c` is different from both. If none of these conditions are met during any iteration, `possible` remains False.
