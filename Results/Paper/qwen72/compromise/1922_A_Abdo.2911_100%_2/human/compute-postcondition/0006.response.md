Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `possible` is False.**

The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `False`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is still 0, `n` is still an input integer, `a` is still a string input by the user, `b` is still a string input by the user, and `c` is still a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The variable `possible` is now explicitly set to `False`.
