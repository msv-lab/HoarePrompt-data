Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `possible` is False.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **NO**
