Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- The value of `possible` is False, meaning that at no point during the loop did either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

Given the `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
