Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program checks if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1` and applies the following logic:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (and `b[i]`) for the template to be valid.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the template to be valid.
   - If any of these conditions are met, the program sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and matches the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
