Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly handles the conditions specified:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates over each character index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If neither condition is met, it continues to the next index.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `1`, `1`, `a`, `b`, `c`
  - For `i = 0`, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'b'`, `c[0] = 'c'`.
  - Since `a[0] != b[0]` and `c[0] != a[0]` and `c[0] != b[0]`, `possible` is set to `True`.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `1`, `2`, `aa`, `bb`, `aa`
  - For `i = 0`, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'b'`, `c[0] = 'a'`.
  - Since `c[0] == a[0]`, the condition is not met.
  - For `i = 1`, `a[1] = 'a'`, `b[1] = 'b'`, `c[1] = 'a'`.
  - Since `c[1] == a[1]`, the condition is not met.
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `1`, `10`, `mathforces`, `luckforces`, `adhoccoder`
  - For `i = 0`, `a[0] = 'm'`, `b[0] = 'l'`, `c[0] = 'a'`.
  - Since `a[0] != b[0]` and `c[0] != a[0]` and `c[0] != b[0]`, `possible` is set to `True`.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `1`, `3`, `acc`, `abd`, `abc`
  - For `i = 0`, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'a'`, `c[0] = 'a'`.
  - Since `a[0] == b[0]` and `c[0] == a[0]`, the condition is not met.
  - For `i = 1`, `a[1] = 'c'`, `b[1] = 'b'`, `c[1] = 'b'`.
  - Since `a[1] != b[1]` but `c[1] == b[1]`, the condition is not met.
  - For `i = 2`, `a[2] = 'c'`, `b[2] = 'd'`, `c[2] = 'c'`.
  - Since `a[2] != b[2]` but `c[2] == a[2]`, the condition is not met.
  - Output: `NO`

The function correctly handles the conditions for all the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
