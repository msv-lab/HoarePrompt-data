### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It then iterates over each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1` to check if a valid template can be constructed.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the template must have an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) at position `i`. For the template to be valid, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If this condition is met, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template can have either `a[i]` or `b[i]` at position `i`, but `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If this condition is met, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
   - If neither condition is met, the loop continues to the next character position.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - If `possible` remains `False`, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis of Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 1`, `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`
  - `a[0]` is "a" and `b[0]` is "b" (different).
  - `c[0]` is "c" (different from both "a" and "b").
  - A valid template can be "A" or "B", so the output should be "YES".

- **Test Case 2**:
  - `n = 2`, `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`
  - `a[0]` is "a" and `b[0]` is "b" (different).
  - `c[0]` is "a" (same as `a[0]`).
  - `a[1]` is "a" and `b[1]` is "b" (different).
  - `c[1]` is "a" (same as `a[1]`).
  - No valid template can be constructed, so the output should be "NO".

- **Test Case 3**:
  - `n = 10`, `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`
  - `a[0]` is "m" and `b[0]` is "l" (different).
  - `c[0]` is "a" (different from both "m" and "l").
  - A valid template can be "M" or "L", so the output should be "YES".

- **Test Case 4**:
  - `n = 3`, `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`
  - `a[0]` is "a" and `b[0]` is "a" (same).
  - `c[0]` is "a" (same as `a[0]`).
  - `a[1]` is "c" and `b[1]` is "b" (different).
  - `c[1]` is "b" (same as `b[1]`).
  - `a[2]` is "c" and `b[2]` is "d" (different).
  - `c[2]` is "c" (same as `a[2]`).
  - No valid template can be constructed, so the output should be "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The test cases provided in the example are handled correctly by the program.

Correctness: **True**
