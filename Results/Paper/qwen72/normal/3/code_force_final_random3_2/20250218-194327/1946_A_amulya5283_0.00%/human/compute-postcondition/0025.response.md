Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

The code `arr.sort()` has already been executed, and `arr` is now sorted in ascending order. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The `median_index` is still `n // 2`, and `current_median` is now the element at the `median_index` of the sorted `arr`. The `heap` still contains elements from `median_index` to the end of `arr`, but these elements are now sorted and all are greater than `current_median`. The `operations` variable remains the same, indicating the number of times the loop has executed.
