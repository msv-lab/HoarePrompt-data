Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` and the new value of `operations` appended, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is not yet a min-heap, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

The code snippet `current_median = arr[median_index]` reassigns the value of `current_median` to the element at the index `median_index` in the sorted list `arr`. Since `median_index` is already calculated as `n // 2`, and `arr` is sorted, `current_median` now holds the value of the middle element in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
