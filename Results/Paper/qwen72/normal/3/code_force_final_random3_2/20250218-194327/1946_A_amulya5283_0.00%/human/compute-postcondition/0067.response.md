Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing `t` values, each value is the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median for each test case, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[t - 1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[t - 1]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, with all elements that were less than or equal to `current_median` increased by 1 until the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of times the smallest element in the heap was increased by 1 to make `heap[0]` greater than `current_median` for the last test case.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- The variable `i` is now `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed the last test case.
- The `results` list contains `t` values, each corresponding to the number of operations required for each test case to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median.
- The variables `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` are all in their final states for the last test case, where `arr` is sorted, `median_index` is the middle index of `arr`, `current_median` is the median value, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from the median index to the end of `arr`, and `operations` is the number of times the smallest element in the heap was incremented to ensure it is greater than the current median.
