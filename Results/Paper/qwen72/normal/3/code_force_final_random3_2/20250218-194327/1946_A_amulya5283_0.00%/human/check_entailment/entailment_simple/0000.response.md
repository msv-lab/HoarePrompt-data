### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input and processes it into a list of test cases, each containing the length of the array and the array itself. This is done correctly by splitting the input and iterating through the data to form the test cases.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - For each test case, the array is sorted. This is necessary to find the median, as the median is defined based on the sorted order of the array.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct because the median is the middle element in a sorted array of odd length, and the element just after the middle in a sorted array of even length.

4. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Increasing the Median**:
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. Each increment is counted as an operation. This approach is correct because it ensures that the smallest element in the heap (which is the current median or the next candidate for the median) is increased until it surpasses the current median.

6. **Output**:
   - The program appends the number of operations required for each test case to the `results` list and then prints each result. This is the correct way to handle multiple test cases and produce the required output.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case. The use of a min-heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently, and the sorting step ensures that the median is correctly identified.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
