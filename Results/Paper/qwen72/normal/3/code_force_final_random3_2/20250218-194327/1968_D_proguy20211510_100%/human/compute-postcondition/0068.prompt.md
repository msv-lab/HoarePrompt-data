Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the final value after all iterations, `ps` is now the value of `p[ps - 1]` after the last successful assignment in the loop, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from the sequence `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, until the loop condition is met, `paths` is a list containing the integers from the sequence `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, until the loop condition is met, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, except the elements at the indices `ps - 1`, `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1`, and so on, are set to 1, indicating the positions that have been visited, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pathb` must have at least one element. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`, and `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and the new `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `pathb` must have at least two elements, `i` is incremented by 1, if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum value between the original `resb` and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `pathb` must have at least three elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is less than `i + 1` if the condition `k < i + 1` was met, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `resb` is the maximum value between the original `resb` and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
