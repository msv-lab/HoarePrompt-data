Output State: **`pathb` must have at least two elements, `i` is incremented by 1, if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum value between the original `resb` and `curr`.**
