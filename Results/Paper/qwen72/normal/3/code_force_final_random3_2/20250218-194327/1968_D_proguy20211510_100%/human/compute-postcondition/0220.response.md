Since the `while` loop condition is `while True:`, this loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1**
