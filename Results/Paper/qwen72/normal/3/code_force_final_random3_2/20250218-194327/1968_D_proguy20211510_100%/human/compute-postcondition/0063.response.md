Output State: **`pathb` must have at least three elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is less than `i + 1`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum value between the original `resb` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
