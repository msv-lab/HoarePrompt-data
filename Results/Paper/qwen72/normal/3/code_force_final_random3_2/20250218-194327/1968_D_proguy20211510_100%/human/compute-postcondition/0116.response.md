Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `pathb` is updated to include `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.***
