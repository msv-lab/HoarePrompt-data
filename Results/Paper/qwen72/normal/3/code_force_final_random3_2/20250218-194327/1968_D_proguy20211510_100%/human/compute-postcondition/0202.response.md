Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` are integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb` remain unchanged, `pathb` is a list containing the integer `a[pb - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where `vis[pb - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0.**

The code appends the integer at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `pathb`, which was initially empty. The rest of the variables and their states remain unchanged.
