Output State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `pres` is `pres + paths[1]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`. If `k < 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation:
- `ress` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`.
- `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`.
- The values of `paths`, `i`, and `pres` remain unchanged.
- If `k < 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
