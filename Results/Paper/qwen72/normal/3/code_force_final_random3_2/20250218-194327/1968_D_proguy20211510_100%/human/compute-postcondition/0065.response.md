Output State: **`pathb` must have at least three elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is less than `i + 1` if the condition `k < i + 1` was met, otherwise `k` remains unchanged. `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`, and `resb` is the maximum value between the original `resb` and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.
- `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i]`.
- `resb` is updated to the maximum value between the original `resb` and the new `curr`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` remains less than `i + 1` if the condition `k < i + 1` was met, otherwise `k` remains unchanged.
- If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
