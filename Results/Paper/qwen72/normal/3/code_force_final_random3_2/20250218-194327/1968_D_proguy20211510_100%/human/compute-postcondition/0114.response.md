Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged; `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`; `pathb` is now `pathb` with `a[pb - 1]` appended to it; if `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain the same. The variable `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. The list `pathb` is updated by appending the value `a[pb - 1]` to it. If the value of `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
