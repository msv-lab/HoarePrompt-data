Output State: **`pathb` must have at least three elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is less than `i + 1` if the condition `k < i + 1` was met, otherwise `k` remains unchanged. `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `resb` is the maximum value between the original `resb` and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- The value of `preb` is incremented by `pathb[i]`.
- The value of `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, where `preb` now includes the addition of `pathb[i]`.
- The value of `resb` is updated to the maximum of the original `resb` and the new `curr`.
- The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged unless the condition `k < i + 1` was met, in which case `k` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
