The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `paths`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `paths`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `paths` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `paths` must still have at least 1 element (since the loop condition is based on the length of `paths`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `paths` must have at least 1 element

The other variables (`pres`, `curr`, and `ress`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`**
