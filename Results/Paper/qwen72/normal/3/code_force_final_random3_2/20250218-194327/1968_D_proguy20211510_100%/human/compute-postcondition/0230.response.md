Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that if `vis[ps - 1]` was not already 1, `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end. `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
