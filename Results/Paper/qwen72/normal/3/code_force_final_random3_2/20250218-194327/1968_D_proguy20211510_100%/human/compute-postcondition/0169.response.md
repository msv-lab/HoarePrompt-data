Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, and `ps` remain unchanged; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1; `pres` is now `pres + paths[i]; `curr` is now `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pres` is updated by adding `paths[i]` to it.
- The value of `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, reflecting the new value of `pres`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
