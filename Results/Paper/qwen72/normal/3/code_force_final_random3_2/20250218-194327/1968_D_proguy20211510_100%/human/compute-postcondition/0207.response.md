The loop in question is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute unless explicitly broken out of within the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any variables or states, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `pb` is unchanged.**
