Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
- `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`.
- `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`.
- `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`.
- `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`.
- `ress` is less than or equal to `resb`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Draw'`.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and their relationships, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The condition `ress` is less than or equal to `resb` is given, but this condition does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will simply print the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
