Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. `pb` is unchanged. `pathb` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
- `pb` remains unchanged because the `break` statement does not modify it.
- `pathb` is updated by appending the element `a[pb - 1]` to it.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis`) remain in their initial state.
