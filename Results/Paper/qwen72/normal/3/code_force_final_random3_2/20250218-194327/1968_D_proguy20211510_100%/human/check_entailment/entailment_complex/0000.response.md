### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the score array `a`, converting them to lists of integers.
   - It initializes `pathb` and `paths` to store the scores collected by Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It initializes a `vis` array to keep track of visited positions in the permutation.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the path for Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation `p` from their starting positions until a cycle is detected.
   - The `vis` array is used to detect cycles, ensuring that the path calculation stops when a position is revisited.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the score accumulation for each turn, considering the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The score is updated using the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, which correctly accounts for the score collected in the current turn and the potential future turns.

4. **Winner Determination:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the function compares `resb` and `ress` to determine the winner.
   - It prints 'Bodya' if `resb` is greater, 'Sasha' if `ress` is greater, and 'Draw' if they are equal.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `k` is less than the number of turns needed to complete a cycle.
   - It correctly initializes the `vis` array for each player separately to avoid interference between their paths.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The function is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only processes each test case up to the length of the permutation and the number of turns `k`.

### Correctness:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required, and the score calculation and winner determination are consistent with the rules of the game.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
