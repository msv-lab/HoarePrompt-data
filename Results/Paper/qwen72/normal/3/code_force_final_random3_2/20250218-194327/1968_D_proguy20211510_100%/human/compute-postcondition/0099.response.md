Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `paths` or `k`, whichever is smaller, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `curr` is the value of `pres + paths[i-1] * (k - (i-1))` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged, `ress` is the maximum value encountered during the loop, which is the maximum of the initial `ress` and all values of `curr` computed in each iteration, and if `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings containing the input values.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k, pb, ps = input().split()` splits the input string into four parts and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the input is split into strings, these variables are now strings containing the input values. The other variables (`i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
