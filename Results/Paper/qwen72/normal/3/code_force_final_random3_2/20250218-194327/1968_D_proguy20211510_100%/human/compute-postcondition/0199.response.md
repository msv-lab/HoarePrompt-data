Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` are integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb` remain unchanged, `pathb` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The initial state remains the same for all variables except `vis`, which is now a list of `n` zeros. This list is initialized to have `n` elements, each set to 0.
