Output State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `pres` is `pres + paths[1]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `paths`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, and `ress` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
