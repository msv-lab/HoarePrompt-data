Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the final value after all iterations, `ps` is now the value of `p[ps - 1]` after the last successful assignment in the loop, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from the sequence `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, until the loop condition is met, `paths` is a list containing the integers from the sequence `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, until the loop condition is met, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, except the elements at the indices `ps - 1`, `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1`, and so on, are set to 1, indicating the positions that have been visited, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0.**
