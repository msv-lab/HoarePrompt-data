Output State: **`i` is 1, `pathb` is a list with at least 2 elements, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of the original `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`. If `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 1.
- `pathb` remains a list with at least 2 elements.
- `curr` is still equal to `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`.
- `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[1]`.
- `resb` remains the maximum of the original `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`.
- If `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
