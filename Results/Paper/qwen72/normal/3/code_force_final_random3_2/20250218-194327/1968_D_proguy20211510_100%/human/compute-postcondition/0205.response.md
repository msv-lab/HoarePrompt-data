Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged; `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and the value of `vis[pb - 1]` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, and the value of `vis[pb - 1]` is set to 1. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
