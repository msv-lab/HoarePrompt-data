For a `while True` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will continue to execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body that is triggered. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific variables and is always true, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged; `paths` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its end; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
