Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged; `paths` is a list that now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its end; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `ps` to be `p[ps - 1]`. The initial state indicates that `ps` is an index used to access an element in the list `a`, and this element is appended to the list `paths`. After the execution, `ps` is updated to the value at index `ps - 1` in the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged.
