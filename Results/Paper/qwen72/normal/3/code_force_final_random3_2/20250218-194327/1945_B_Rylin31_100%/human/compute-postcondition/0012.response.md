Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from user input. It then calculates and prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, with `a`, `b`, and `m` being the values from the last test case. **
