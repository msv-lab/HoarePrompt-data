The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an integer provided by user input that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input that must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by user input.**
