Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input that must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the latest user input.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as the integer provided by the user input, indicating the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run. The variable `i` is now equal to `t-1`, which means the loop has just completed its last iteration. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` hold the values provided by the user input during the last iteration of the loop.
