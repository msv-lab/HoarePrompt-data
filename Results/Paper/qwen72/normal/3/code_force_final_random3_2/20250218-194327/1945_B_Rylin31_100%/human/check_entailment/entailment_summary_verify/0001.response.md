### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at different frequencies, `a` and `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Identifying the Key Insight:**
   - The key insight is to find the maximum overlap of fireworks launched by both installations.
   - For any given minute `x`, the number of fireworks visible from the first installation is the number of multiples of `a` that fall within the range `[x - m, x]`.
   - Similarly, the number of fireworks visible from the second installation is the number of multiples of `b` that fall within the same range.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The provided solution calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case.
   - `m // a` gives the number of complete intervals of `a` minutes within `m` minutes.
   - `m // b` gives the number of complete intervals of `b` minutes within `m` minutes.
   - The `+ 2` is added to account for the possibility of both installations launching a firework at the same time and the visibility period extending beyond `m` minutes.

4. **Checking the Formula:**
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is not correct. It does not account for the overlap correctly.
   - The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the maximum overlap.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at any minute should be the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period, minus the overlap if they launch at the same time.

5. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct formula to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is:
     \[
     \text{max\_visible} = \left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{b} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the visibility period and the overlap correctly.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
   - The solution should be revised to use the correct formula.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The correct approach should involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and using the formula provided in the reasoning section.
