Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not accurately compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. The program simply calculates the sum of the number of times each installation can launch a firework within the visibility duration `m` and adds 2, which does not account for the overlap in the visibility of fireworks launched by both installations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Visibility Duration**: Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
2. **Overlap Calculation**: We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time. This involves finding the time when the visibility windows of the fireworks from both installations overlap the most.

The correct approach involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the common launch times and then determining the maximum overlap within the visibility duration `m + 1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def lcm(x, y):
    from math import gcd
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = 1 + (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // lcm_ab
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

Explanation:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.
2. **Visibility Calculation**: The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is calculated by:
   - Adding 1 for the initial firework.
   - Adding the number of times the first installation can launch a firework within the visibility duration `m + 1`.
   - Adding the number of times the second installation can launch a firework within the visibility duration `m + 1`.
   - Subtracting the number of times both installations launch a firework at the same time (i.e., the common launch times within `m + 1`).

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the overlap and provide the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
