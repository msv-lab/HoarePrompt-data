Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` plus the last element of `a` is exactly 2, `ans` is increased by 1. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2. If the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` plus the last element of `a` is not exactly 2 and the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negative of the last element of `a` is even, `tmp` now includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` as its last element.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tmp` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)` and `ans` is increased by `i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tmp` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`, and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, both `y` and `ans` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tmp` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `i`, and `y` is decreased by the value of `i - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
