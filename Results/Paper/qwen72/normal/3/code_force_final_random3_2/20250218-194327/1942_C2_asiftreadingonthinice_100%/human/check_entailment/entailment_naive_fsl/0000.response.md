Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are such that the gaps between them are large, and the additional vertices chosen by the algorithm do not result in the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
10 2 3
1 7
```
In this case, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 7. The program will calculate the gap between these vertices as 6 (since 7 - 1 = 6), and it will try to add vertices to maximize the number of triangles. However, the program does not correctly account for the circular nature of the polygon, which means the gap between vertex 7 and vertex 1 should also be considered (i.e., 10 - 7 + 1 = 4).

The program will add vertices to the gap of 6, but it might not correctly maximize the number of triangles. The correct approach should consider both gaps and ensure that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is formed. The program's logic for handling gaps and adding vertices is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
