Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` must have at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is reassigned to the value of `x + y - 2`.
- The values of `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged.
- The variable `ii` is still `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`.
- The variable `i` is still the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` must have at least one element.
- The list `a` remains sorted in ascending order.
