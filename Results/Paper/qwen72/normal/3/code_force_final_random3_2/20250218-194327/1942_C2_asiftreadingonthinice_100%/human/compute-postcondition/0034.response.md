To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object `tmp` in the loop head, as it is the only object that directly affects the loop's execution. The loop will execute if `tmp` is a non-empty list.

Let's break down the state adjustments needed:

1. **`tmp` must be a non-empty list**: For the loop to execute, `tmp` must contain at least one element. This means that the conditions for adding elements to `tmp` must have been met at least once.

2. **Elements in `tmp`**: The elements in `tmp` are derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the special condition involving the first and last elements of `a` and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `x`, `y` are integers.
- `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `tt` is greater than 0.
- `ii` is 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2.
- If the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` plus the last element of `a` is exactly 2, `ans` is increased by 1.
- `tmp` is a sorted list containing the results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2.
- If the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` plus the last element of `a` is not exactly 2 and the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negative of the last element of `a` is even, `tmp` now includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` as its last element.

To ensure `tmp` is non-empty, at least one of the following conditions must be true:
- There is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2.
- The special condition involving the first and last elements of `a` and `n` is met, and the sum is even.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `tmp` is non-empty. We can summarize this as:

State: **`tmp` must be a non-empty list, `i` is the first element in `tmp`**
