Output State: **`ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. For each element `i` in `tmp` where `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. The loop stops when `y < i - 1` or when all elements in `tmp` have been processed. `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` must have at least one element.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `ans` starts with the value `x + y - 2` and is incremented by the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2.
- If the difference between `a[0] + n` and `a[len(a) - 1]` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- For each element `i` in the sorted list `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.
- The loop stops either when `y` is less than `i - 1` for the current element `i` in `tmp`, or when all elements in `tmp` have been processed.
- The variables `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`.
- The variable `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed during the loop.
