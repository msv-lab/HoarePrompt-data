The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tmp`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tmp`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next element in `tmp`. Since `tmp` is a sorted list, the next element will be the one immediately following the current `i` in `tmp`.

Given that `i` is `len(a) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, and `tmp` contains the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2, the next `i` will be the next value in `tmp` that satisfies these conditions.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be the next element in `tmp` after the current `i`.
- `tmp` must have at least one more element after the current `i`.

State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the next element in `tmp` after `len(a) - 1`. `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**
