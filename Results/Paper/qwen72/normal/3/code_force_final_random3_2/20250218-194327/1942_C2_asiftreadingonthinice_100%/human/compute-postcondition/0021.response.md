Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `ans` is `x + y + 1` if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number but not 2, and `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not an even number. `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number but not 2, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list.**
