Postcondition: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `i` is 1, `tmp` is now an empty list, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number.**
