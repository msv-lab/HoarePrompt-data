The only objects in the loop head are variables `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `ii` and `tt`. If `ii` is less than `tt`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, making it `tt`. However, for the loop condition to still be true, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, which means `tt` must be at least `ii + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `ii` is `tt`
- `tt` must be greater than `ii`, so `tt` must be at least `ii + 1`.

State: **`ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` where `y >= i - 1`, and finally plus the value of `y`. `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` must have at least one element.**
