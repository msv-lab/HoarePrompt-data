The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three values from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. This means that the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` where `y >= i - 1`, and finally plus the value of `y`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` must have at least one element. `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the input.**
