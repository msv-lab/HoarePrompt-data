You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for ii in range(tt):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = x + y - 2
        
        tmp = []
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        
        tmp.sort()
        
        for i in tmp:
            if y >= i - 1:
                ans += i
                y -= i - 1
            else:
                break
        
        ans += y
        
        print(min(ans, n - 2))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `tt` iterations. `ans` is the final computed value for each iteration, which is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` where `y >= i - 1`, and finally plus the remaining value of `y`. `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all elements `i` in `tmp` that were processed in the loop, where `y` was greater than or equal to `(i - 1)`. `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` is the total number of iterations. `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sides of the polygon), `x` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), `y` (the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose), and `chosen_vertices` (a list of vertices Bessie has chosen). It returns the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using these vertices.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
