Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `a`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `chosen_vertices`, `tt`, and `ii`) remain unchanged.
