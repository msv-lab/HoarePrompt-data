Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is now sorted in ascending order. `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. If `y >= i - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `(len(a) - 1)` and `y` is decreased by `(len(a) - 1)`. If `y < i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is sorted in ascending order. `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y < i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged unless `y >= i - 1`. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the next element in `tmp` after `len(a) - 1`. `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is sorted in ascending order. `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y < i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged unless `y >= i - 1`. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the current `i`. `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
