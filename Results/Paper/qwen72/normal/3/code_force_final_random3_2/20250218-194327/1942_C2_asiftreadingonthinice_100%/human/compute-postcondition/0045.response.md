Postcondition: ***`tmp` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`, and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, both `y` and `ans` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
