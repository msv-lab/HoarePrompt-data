Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 < t <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is false, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned the values of three input integers.
- The conditions regarding the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c` are still valid based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
