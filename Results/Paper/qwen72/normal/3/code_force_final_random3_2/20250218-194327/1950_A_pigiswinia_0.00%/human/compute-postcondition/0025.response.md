Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 < t <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c` and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.***
