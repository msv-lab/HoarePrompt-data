Output State: **The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c. The function should be called with the digits a, b, and c as arguments, and these digits must satisfy 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. Additionally, the number of test cases t must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. `t` is now an input integer.**
