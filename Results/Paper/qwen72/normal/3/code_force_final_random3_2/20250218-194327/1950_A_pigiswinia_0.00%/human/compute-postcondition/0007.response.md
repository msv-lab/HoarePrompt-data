The `print('PEAK')` statement will print the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The precondition only specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that `a < b > c` and it is not the case that `a < b < c`. However, these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement, which simply prints the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
