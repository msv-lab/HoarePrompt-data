You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c. The function should be called with the digits a, b, and c as arguments, and these digits must satisfy 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. Additionally, the number of test cases t must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include parameters for the digits or the number of test cases, which is inconsistent with the problem description.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c` and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits are equal. According to the problem description, if the digits are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), the output should be "NONE". However, the program will output "STAIRS" for `0 0 0` because the condition `a < b < c` is not strictly checked for inequality. The correct condition should be `a < b and b < c` to ensure that the digits are strictly increasing. Similarly, the condition for a peak should be `a < b and b > c` to ensure that the digits are strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b and b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

End of Original Assessment
