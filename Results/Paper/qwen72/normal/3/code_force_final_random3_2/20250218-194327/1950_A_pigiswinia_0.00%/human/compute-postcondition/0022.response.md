Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`.
- Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true.
- Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is false, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'PEAK'`.
- The initial state provides conditions on the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement will always execute and print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
