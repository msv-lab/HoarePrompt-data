#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c. The function should be called with the digits a, b, and c as arguments, and these digits must satisfy 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. Additionally, the number of test cases t must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include parameters for the digits or the number of test cases, which is inconsistent with the problem description.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c` and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a positive integer `t` from the user input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. It then checks the relationship between these three integers and prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each case.
