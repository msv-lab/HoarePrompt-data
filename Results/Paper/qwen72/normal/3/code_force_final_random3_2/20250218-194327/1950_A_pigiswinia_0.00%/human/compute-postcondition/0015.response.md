Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 < t <= 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`.
- Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true.
- Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is false, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

This statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` or any other variables. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the execution of the `print` statement because the statement does not depend on any of these conditions.

Output: **PEAK**
