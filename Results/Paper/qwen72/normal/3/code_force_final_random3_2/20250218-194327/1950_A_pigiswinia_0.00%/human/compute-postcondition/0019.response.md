The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 < t <= 1000, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 < t <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is false, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`.**
