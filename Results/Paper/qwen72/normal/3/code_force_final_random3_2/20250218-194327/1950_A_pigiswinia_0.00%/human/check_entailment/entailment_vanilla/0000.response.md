Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then processes each test case individually. This is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is also correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct based on the problem description.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct based on the problem description.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program outputs "NONE". This is correct as well.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "STAIRS" when the digits form a stair. However, the problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (without the 'S'). This is a discrepancy.
   - The program prints "PEAK" when the digits form a peak, which is correct.
   - The program prints "NONE" when the digits do not form a stair or a peak, which is correct.

5. **Overall Logic**: The logic of the program is correct in terms of determining the conditions for a stair and a peak. The only issue is the incorrect output for the "STAIR" case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the output string for the "STAIR" case.

Correctness: **False**
