Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1.** 

The initial state variables `k`, `rest`, `prime`, and `factor` remain unchanged. The variable `prime_to_i` is now set to 1.
