The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `factors[prime]`. The loop will execute if `factors[prime] + 1` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `factor` is the first element in `rest`
- `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`
- `factors[prime]` must be at least 0
- The value `factor * prime` is yielded

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `factors[prime] + 1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `factors[prime]` remains the same.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime` is yielded.**
