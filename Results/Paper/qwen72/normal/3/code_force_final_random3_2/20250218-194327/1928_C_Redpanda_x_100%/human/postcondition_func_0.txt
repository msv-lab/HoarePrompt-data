The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` where 1 < n <= 10^9. It computes the prime factorization of `n` and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the generator can be used to iterate over all the prime factors of `n`. The prime factorization is stored in a dictionary `factors` where each key is a prime factor and the value is the exponent indicating how many times the factor divides `n`.
