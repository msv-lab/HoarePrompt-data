Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime_to_i * prime` is yielded.**

In natural language: The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to be `prime * prime_to_i * prime`. The value `factor * prime_to_i * prime` is yielded. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
