Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1.** 

The variable `prime_to_i` is initialized to 1, while the other variables (`k`, `rest`, `prime`, and `factor`) retain their initial values and conditions.
