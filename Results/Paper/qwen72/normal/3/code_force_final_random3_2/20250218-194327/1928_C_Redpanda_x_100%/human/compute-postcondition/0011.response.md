Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime` is yielded.**

Explanation:
- The value of `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, which is the same as `factor * prime` because `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`.
- The values of `k`, `rest`, `prime`, `factor`, `prime_to_i`, and `factors[prime]` remain unchanged.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1.
- The precondition that `rest` is a non-empty iterable and `factors[prime]` must be at least 0 remains valid.
