You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

If `nn` > 1, `nn` is included as a key in `factors` (if it wasn't already) and its value is incremented by 1. `nn` is set to 1, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime factor of `n` such that `i * i` > `n`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `factors`, `nn`, and `i` remain unchanged.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `n`, `nn` is 1, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime factor of `n` such that `i * i` > `n`, `primes` is a list of the keys from the `factors` dictionary, and `generate(0)` has returned an iterable containing all the prime factors of `n`. The generator has yielded all the prime factors of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` where 1 < n <= 10^9. It computes the prime factorization of `n` and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the generator can be used to iterate over all the prime factors of `n`. The prime factorization is stored in a dictionary `factors` where each key is a prime factor and the value is the exponent indicating how many times the factor divides `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where primes is a list of prime numbers.

    #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an iterable that has been fully iterated, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` accepts a non-negative integer `k` and generates a sequence of integers. The sequence is based on the prime numbers in the list `primes` and the corresponding exponents in the dictionary `factors`. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the function yields the integer 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates a sequence of integers by multiplying each integer from the recursive call `generate(k + 1)` by powers of `primes[k]` up to the power specified by `factors[primes[k]]`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all possible products of the prime numbers up to the specified power have been yielded, starting from 1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned follow a specific sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Settling Pattern:**
   - For the first \( k \) positions, the numbers are \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k \).
   - For the next \( k - 2 \) positions, the numbers are \( k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 \).
   - This pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

3. **Identifying the Constraints:**
   - \( k > 1 \) (since the settling does not exist for \( k = 1 \)).
   - Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received must fit into the described pattern.

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - We need to find \( k \) such that \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) results in a position where \( x \) is assigned.
   - The position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should be either \( x \) or \( 2k - 1 - x \).

5. **Function 1: `func_1(n)`**
   - This function is intended to generate factors of \( n \).
   - It uses a prime factorization approach to find the factors of \( n \).
   - The function `generate(0)` is called to yield factors, but `primes` and `factors` are not defined within the scope of `func_1`.

6. **Function 2: `generate(k)`**
   - This function is a recursive generator that yields all possible factors of \( n \) based on the prime factorization.
   - It correctly generates the factors by iterating over the prime factors and their powers.

7. **Integration and Correctness:**
   - The `func_1` function is incomplete and does not properly define `primes` and `factors` within its scope.
   - The `generate` function is correctly implemented but relies on `primes` and `factors` being defined globally or passed as arguments.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program is incomplete and lacks the necessary integration to solve the problem as described.
   - The `func_1` function should properly define and use the `primes` and `factors` variables.
   - The `generate` function should be called with the correct arguments to ensure it works as intended.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it is incomplete and does not properly define the necessary variables within the scope of `func_1`. Additionally, the logic to determine the valid \( k \) values based on the settling pattern is missing.
