Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` contains `[1, 2]` if `x % 2 == 0`, otherwise `output1` contains `[1]`, `output2` contains `[x, int(x / 2)]` if `x % 2 == 0`, otherwise `output2` contains `[int(x / 2)]`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` remains the same.
- The value of `output1` remains the same.
- The value of `output2` is updated by appending `int(x / 2)` to it. If `x` is even, `output2` originally contained `[x]`, so it now contains `[x, int(x / 2)]`. If `x` is odd, `output2` was originally empty or contained some other value, so it now contains `[int(x / 2)]`.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
