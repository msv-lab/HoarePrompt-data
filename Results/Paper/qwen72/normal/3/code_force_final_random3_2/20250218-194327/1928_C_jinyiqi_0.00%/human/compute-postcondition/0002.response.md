To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the range defined by `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

1. The variable `i` will start at 1, which is the first value in the range.
2. The loop will execute as long as `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1, because the range function in Python generates a sequence of numbers from the start value (inclusive) to the stop value (exclusive).

Given that `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, the minimum value of `x` is 1. For `x = 1`, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` will be `int(1 ** 0.5) + 1 = 2`. This means the loop will execute at least once for `x = 1`.

Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once as long as `x` is within the given range. The state of `i` and the range need to be adjusted to reflect the initial conditions for the loop to start.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1**
