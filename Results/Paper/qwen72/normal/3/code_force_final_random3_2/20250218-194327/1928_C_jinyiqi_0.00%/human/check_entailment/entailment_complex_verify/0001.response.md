### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining how many different values of \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and Vasya's number \( x \) must match the pattern at position \( n \).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern for \( k \) is: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).
   - This pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - Vasya's position \( n \) and number \( x \) must satisfy the pattern.

3. **Constraints:**
   - \( k > 1 \).
   - \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \).

4. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = m \cdot (2k - 2) + p \), where \( m \) is the number of complete cycles and \( p \) is the position within the current cycle.
   - The number \( x \) must match the pattern at position \( p \).

5. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses two main conditions to check if \( k \) is valid:
     - \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
     - \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - These conditions are derived from the fact that \( n \) and \( x \) must align with the pattern's periodicity.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \).
   - The divisors are used to find potential values of \( 2k - 2 \).

7. **Checking Valid \( k \):**
   - For each divisor \( s \) of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \), the program checks if \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \ge x \).
   - If both conditions are met, \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is a valid \( k \).

8. **Output:**
   - The program collects all valid \( k \) values and removes duplicates using `set`.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- **Function Placement:**
  - The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1` was defined after it was used, which can cause a runtime error. This is a valid concern and the function should be defined before it is called.

- **Pattern Matching:**
  - The conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) are derived from the pattern's periodicity and are correct.
  - The logic to check if these divisors can form valid \( k \) values is consistent with the problem's constraints and pattern.

- **Correctness of the Program:**
  - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
  - It correctly checks if these divisors can form valid \( k \) values.
  - The conditions and logic used to determine valid \( k \) values are consistent with the problem's constraints and pattern.

### Final Correctness:

- The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and the identification of the minor issue with function placement.
- After correcting the function placement, the program should work correctly for the given problem.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))
```

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True** (after the minor correction of function placement)
