### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. The pattern is: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For Vasya to receive the number \( x \), his position \( n \) must be such that \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) falls within the range where \( x \) is assigned.
   - The number \( x \) can appear in two parts of the pattern: the first \( k \) positions and the next \( k - 2 \) positions.

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - If \( n \) is in the first \( k \) positions, then \( n \equiv x \pmod{k} \).
   - If \( n \) is in the next \( k - 2 \) positions, then \( n \equiv k - x + 1 \pmod{k} \).

4. **Conditions for Valid \( k \)**:
   - \( k \) must be greater than 1.
   - \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k - 2} \) or \( n \equiv k - x + 1 \pmod{2k - 2} \).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two values: \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It then calls `func_1` to find the divisors of these values.
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of divisors of \( x \) in a specific order.
   - The program checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \), and appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It returns a list of divisors in a specific order, but the order does not affect the correctness of the solution.

7. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies the conditions for valid \( k \) by checking the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - The conditions \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 >= x \) ensure that the calculated \( k \) values are valid and greater than 1.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \) and \( 1 \le t \le 100 \) correctly.
   - The program correctly handles cases where no valid \( k \) exists (e.g., when \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \) have no suitable divisors).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem constraints and requirements. It correctly identifies the valid \( k \) values for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
