Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1 (this information is not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `_` is a placeholder (this information is not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `n` is the input integer (this information is not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `b` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are not less than the first element of `a`.
   - `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element of `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(cnt)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `cnt` is defined as the number of elements in the list `b` that are less than the first element of the list `a`.
   - Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`.
   - However, based on the given information, `cnt` will be an integer representing the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element of `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element of `a`)**
