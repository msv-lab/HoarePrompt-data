Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `j` is 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 0. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
