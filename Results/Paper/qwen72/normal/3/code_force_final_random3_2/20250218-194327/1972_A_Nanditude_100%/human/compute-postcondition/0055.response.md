Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `j` is 0, and the element `b[j]` is greater than or equal to the element `a[i]`**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
