Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `j` is 1, `cnt` is 1 or 2, `i` is 0 or 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` was initially 1, so after the increment, `cnt` is 2, and `i` remains 0.
- If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `cnt` was initially 0, so after the increment, `cnt` is 1, and `i` is 1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.
