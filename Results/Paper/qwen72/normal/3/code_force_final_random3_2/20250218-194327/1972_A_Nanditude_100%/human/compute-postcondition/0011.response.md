Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
