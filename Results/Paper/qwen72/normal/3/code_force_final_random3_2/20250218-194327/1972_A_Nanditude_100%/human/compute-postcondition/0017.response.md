The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 2, and `cnt` is 0 or 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is incremented to 1, with `b[j]` being greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`.**
