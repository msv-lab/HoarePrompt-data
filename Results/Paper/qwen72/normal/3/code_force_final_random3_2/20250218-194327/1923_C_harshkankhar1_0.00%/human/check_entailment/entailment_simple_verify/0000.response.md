### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is fine for this context since it reads input directly.
   - The function correctly reads the length `n` and the number of queries `q` from the input.
   - It then reads the array `a` and prepends a `0` to it for easier cumulative sum calculations.

2. **Cumulative Sum Arrays:**
   - The array `b` is initialized to store the cumulative sum of values `x`, where `x` is `1` if `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise.
   - The array `a` is converted to a cumulative sum array using `itertools.accumulate`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` using the cumulative sum array `a`.
   - It also calculates the sum of the corresponding values in `b` using the cumulative sum array `b`.
   - The program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than the sum of the corresponding values in `b` (`b[y] - b[x - 1]`).
   - Additionally, it checks if the subarray length is 1 (`x == y`).

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray length is 1 by printing "NO" if `x == y`.
   - This is because, for a subarray of length 1, it is impossible to find an array `b` such that `b[i] > 0`, `b[i] != a[i]`, and `b[i] = a[i]`.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for determining if a subarray is good is based on the cumulative sums of `a` and `b`.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of the corresponding values in `b`, which is necessary for the subarray to be good.
   - The program correctly prints "NO" for subarrays of length 1, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **accurate**. The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray length is 1 by printing "NO". For subarrays of length greater than 1, the program uses the cumulative sums to determine if the subarray is good, which is a valid approach. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
