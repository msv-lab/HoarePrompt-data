Output State: **`n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is a positive integer and `q` is a non-negative integer. `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, and the list of queries is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
