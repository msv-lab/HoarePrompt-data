Output State: **`n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is a positive integer and `q` is a non-negative integer. `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`. The list of queries is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are the integers provided by the input.**
