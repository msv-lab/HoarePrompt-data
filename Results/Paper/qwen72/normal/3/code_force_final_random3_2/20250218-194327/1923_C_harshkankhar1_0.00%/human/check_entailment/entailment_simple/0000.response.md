### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined but does not take any parameters. However, it reads the input directly within the function, which is a common practice in competitive programming. This is fine for the given context.

3. **Array Initialization**: 
   - The array `a` is initialized with a leading zero and then populated with the input values. This is correct as it allows for easier cumulative sum calculations.
   - The array `b` is initialized with zeros and then populated with cumulative sums of a value `x` which is 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 otherwise. This is correct because it ensures that `b[i]` is always greater than 0 and different from `a[i]`.

4. **Cumulative Sums**:
   - The program uses `accumulate` from the `itertools` module to compute the cumulative sums of the original array `a`. This is correct and efficient.

5. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[x:y+1]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` or if `x == y`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` ensures that the sum of the subarray in `a` is not less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. This is necessary because if the sum of `a` is less, it's impossible to find a `b` that satisfies the conditions.
   - The condition `x == y` ensures that the subarray is not a single element, as a single element cannot be different from itself.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The cumulative sum approach is efficient and the conditions checked are valid for the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
