To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the list `a`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is initialized to `n`.
- `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
- `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `b[i]`**:
   - `b[i]` is defined as the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `x` is determined by the value of `a[i]`:
     - If `a[i] > 1`, then `x = 1`.
     - If `a[i] <= 1`, then `x = 2`.

2. **Transforming `a`**:
   - The list `a` is transformed to be a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list.
   - This means that each element in the new `a` list is the sum of all elements from the start of the original `a` list up to that index.

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - Let's assume the original `a` list is `[a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`.
   - The new `a` list will be `[a1, a1 + a2, a1 + a2 + a3, ..., a1 + a2 + ... + an]`.

4. **Determining `x` Values**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, we need to check if `a[i]` (in the original `a` list) is greater than 1 to determine `x`.
   - The cumulative sum `b[i]` will be the sum of these `x` values.

5. **Final `a` List**:
   - The final `a` list will be the cumulative sums of the original `a` list, which means each element in `a` will be the sum of all previous elements in the original `a` list up to that index.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

- Suppose `n = 3` and the original `a` list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The new `a` list will be `[1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 3] = [1, 3, 6]`.

### Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the transformed `a` list, which is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list.

Output: **[a1, a1 + a2, a1 + a2 + a3, ..., a1 + a2 + ... + an] (where each element is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list up to that index)**

In natural language, the output will be the elements of the list `a`, where each element is the sum of all previous elements in the original `a` list up to that index.
