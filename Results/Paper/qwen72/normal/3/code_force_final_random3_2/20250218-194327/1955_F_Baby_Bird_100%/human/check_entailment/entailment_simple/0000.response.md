### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game is won by Bob if the bitwise XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Eve can remove one number at a time to maximize Bob's wins.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
   - If the sequence has an even number of a particular integer, removing one of them will not change the XOR result.
   - If the sequence has an odd number of a particular integer, removing one of them will change the XOR result.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Wins:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The expression inside the `join` function calculates the sum of \( 3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) for each \( p_i \).
   - \( x // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of \( p_i \), and each pair contributes 0 to the XOR.
   - \( x \% 2 \) gives the remainder when \( p_i \) is divided by 2, which is 1 if \( p_i \) is odd and 0 if \( p_i \) is even.
   - \( (i < 3) \) is a condition that is true for the first three integers (1, 2, 3) and false for the fourth integer (4).

5. **Sum and Division by 3:**
   - The sum of the calculated values is then divided by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - This division by 3 is based on the observation that for every three numbers, Bob can win once if the sequence is managed optimally.

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic inside the function aligns with the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.
