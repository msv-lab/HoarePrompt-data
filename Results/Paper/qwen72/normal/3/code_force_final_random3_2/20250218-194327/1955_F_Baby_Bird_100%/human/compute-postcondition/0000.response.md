Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it will print based on the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `p_i` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\), representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   ```
   This line reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.

2. **Looping Through Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
   ```
   This loop runs `t` times, once for each test case.

3. **Reading the Input for Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   p = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   For each test case, this line reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the result in the list `p`. The list `p` will contain four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

4. **Calculating the Result for Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   result = sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(p)) // 3
   ```
   - `enumerate(p)` generates pairs of indices and values from the list `p`.
   - `x // 2` computes the integer division of `x` by 2.
   - `3 * (x // 2)` multiplies the result of the integer division by 3.
   - `x % 2` computes the remainder of `x` when divided by 2.
   - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` multiplies the remainder by 1 if the index `i` is less than 3 (i.e., for the first three elements of `p`), and by 0 if `i` is 3 (i.e., for the fourth element of `p`).
   - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 using integer division.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join([str(result) for _ in range(t)]))
   ```
   This line prints the result for each test case, with each result on a new line.

### Explanation of the Calculation:
- For each test case, the code calculates the sum of the following expression for each element in `p`:
  - \(3 \times \left(\frac{p_i}{2}\right) + (p_i \mod 2) \times (i < 3)\)
- The term \(3 \times \left(\frac{p_i}{2}\right)\) contributes 3 for every pair of elements in `p_i`.
- The term \((p_i \mod 2) \times (i < 3)\) contributes 1 for every odd element in the first three positions of `p_i` and 0 for the fourth position.
- The total sum is then divided by 3 using integer division.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `p = [4, 2, 3, 1]`:
  - For `p_0 = 4`: \(3 \times (4 // 2) + (4 % 2) \times (0 < 3) = 3 \times 2 + 0 \times 1 = 6\)
  - For `p_1 = 2`: \(3 \times (2 // 2) + (2 % 2) \times (1 < 3) = 3 \times 1 + 0 \times 1 = 3\)
  - For `p_2 = 3`: \(3 \times (3 // 2) + (3 % 2) \times (2 < 3) = 3 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 = 4\)
  - For `p_3 = 1`: \(3 \times (1 // 2) + (1 % 2) \times (3 < 3) = 3 \times 0 + 1 \times 0 = 0\)
  - Total sum: \(6 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 13\)
  - Result: \(13 // 3 = 4\)

### Final Output:
The code will print the result of the calculation for each test case, with each result on a new line. The result for each test case is the integer division of the sum of the calculated values by 3.

Output: **result (where result is the integer division of the sum of the calculated values by 3 for each test case)**

For example, if `t = 2` and the inputs for the test cases are:
- Test Case 1: `4 2 3 1`
- Test Case 2: `5 0 2 2`

The output will be:
```
4
3
```
