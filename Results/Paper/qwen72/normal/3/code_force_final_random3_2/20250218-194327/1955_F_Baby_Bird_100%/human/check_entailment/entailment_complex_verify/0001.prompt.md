You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: result (where result is the integer division of the sum of the calculated values by 3 for each test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. It then calculates and prints the integer division of the sum of a specific transformation of these values by 3. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. If any input is out of the specified ranges (1 <= t <= 10^4 and 0 <= p_i <= 200), the function does not handle these cases and may produce unexpected results or errors.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Condition Analysis:**
   - For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
   - For Alice to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be non-zero.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - The key is to balance the counts of the numbers to achieve this.

5. **Count Analysis:**
   - Let \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) be the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The XOR of the sequence can be simplified by considering the parity of the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Specifically, the XOR of the sequence is zero if and only if the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all even or all odd.

6. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing the results of the expression \( 3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) for each count \( p_i \).
   - The expression \( 3 * (x // 2) \) counts the number of pairs of the same number that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - The expression \( x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) adds an extra 1 if there is an odd count of 1, 2, or 3, which helps in balancing the sequence to achieve a zero XOR.
   - The sum is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

7. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic of the program aligns with the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers, based on the given problem description and constraints.
