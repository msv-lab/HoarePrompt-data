You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: result (where result is the integer division of the sum of the calculated values by 3 for each test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. It then calculates and prints the integer division of the sum of a specific transformation of these values by 3. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. If any input is out of the specified ranges (1 <= t <= 10^4 and 0 <= p_i <= 200), the function does not handle these cases and may produce unexpected results or errors.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the constraints and the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads four integers `p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4` representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.
3. The expression inside the `join` function calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the formula:
   \[
   \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum(3 \times \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor + x \% 2 \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor
   \]
   where `x` is the count of each number and `i` is the index (0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 3, and 3 for 4).

4. The formula works as follows:
   - For each count `x`, it calculates the maximum number of pairs of the same number that can be removed, which is `3 * (x // 2)`.
   - It then adds the remaining single number if it exists and if it is not the count of 4, which is `x % 2 * (i < 3)`.
   - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general logic for the problem. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program seems to work for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
