Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`t`**: This is an input integer with a constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The value of `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so we don't need to focus on it further.

2. **`e`**: This is initialized to 0. It is not used in the print statement, so it is irrelevant for our task.

3. **`l`**: This is an input integer. The value of `l` is not directly used in the print statement, but it is used to determine the value of `i`.

4. **`nums`**: This is a list of integers input by the user. The exact values of the elements in `nums` are not specified, but we know it is a list of integers.

5. **`i`**: This is set to `l - 1`. Since `l` is an input integer, `i` will be the index of the last element in the list `nums` (assuming `l` is the length of `nums`).

6. **`x`**: This is the maximum value in the list `nums`. The exact value of `x` depends on the elements of `nums`.

7. **`y`**: This is the minimum value in the list `nums`. The exact value of `y` depends on the elements of `nums`.

The print statement `print(x - y)` will output the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
