Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```
The correct output should be 3, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2]. However, the program will output 3 - 1 = 2, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then calculating the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
