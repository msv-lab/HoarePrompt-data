Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is the minimum value among `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` if all of these values are less than 100000000, otherwise `y` is 100000000. If `nums[2]` > `x` and `nums[2]` > 0, then `x` is updated to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0 if `nums[2]` <= 0 or `nums[2]` <= `x`.***
