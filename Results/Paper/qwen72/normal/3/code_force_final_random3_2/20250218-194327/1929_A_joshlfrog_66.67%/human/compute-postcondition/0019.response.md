Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is set to the value of `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` is set to the value of `nums[1]`, `x` is set to the value of `nums[2]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to the value of `nums[2]` as `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
