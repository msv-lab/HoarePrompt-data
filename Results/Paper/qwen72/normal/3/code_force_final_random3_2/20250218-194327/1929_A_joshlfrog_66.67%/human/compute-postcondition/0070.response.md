Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer that must be at least 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, and `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` (whichever is smaller). If `nums[2]` < `y`, `y` is updated to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `y` remains either 100000000, `nums[0]`, or `nums[1]` based on the initial conditions. `x` is either 0, `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]` (if `nums[2]` > `x`), based on the initial conditions and the comparison with `nums[2]`.***
