Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is 100000000. If `nums[0]` is greater than 0, `x` is set to the value of `nums[0]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**
