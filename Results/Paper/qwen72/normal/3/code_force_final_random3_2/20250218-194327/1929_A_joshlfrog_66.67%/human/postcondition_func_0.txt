The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` (where `2 <= l <= 100`) and a list of `l` integers. The function computes and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the differences between the maximum and minimum values of each list have been printed.
