### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n` from the input.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case. Inside the function, it reads `x` and `n` from the input and initializes `ans` to 0.

3. **Loop for Finding GCD**: The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive). This is a common optimization to reduce the number of iterations when checking divisors of a number.

4. **Divisor Check**: For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). If `i` is a divisor, it then checks two conditions:
   - `n <= x // i`: If this condition is true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - `n <= i`: If this condition is true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

5. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved.

### Analysis of the Conditions:

- **Condition 1**: `n <= x // i` ensures that `n` sub-problems can be created with each having a difficulty of at least `i`. This is because `x // i` gives the number of sub-problems of difficulty `i` that can be created.
- **Condition 2**: `n <= i` ensures that `n` sub-problems can be created with each having a difficulty of at least `x // i`. This is because `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `x // i` gives the difficulty of each sub-problem if `i` sub-problems are created.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
  - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
  - For `i = 1`: `n <= 10 // 1` (True), `ans = max(0, 1) = 1`
  - For `i = 2`: `n <= 10 // 2` (True), `ans = max(1, 2) = 2`
  - For `i = 5`: `n <= 5` (False), `n <= 10 // 5` (True), `ans = max(2, 2) = 2`
  - For `i = 10`: `n <= 10` (False), `n <= 10 // 10` (False)
  - Final `ans = 2`

- **Test Case 2**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
  - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
  - For `i = 1`: `n <= 5 // 1` (True), `ans = max(0, 1) = 1`
  - For `i = 5`: `n <= 5` (True), `ans = max(1, 1) = 1`
  - Final `ans = 1`

- **Test Case 3**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
  - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
  - For `i = 6`: `n <= 420 // 6` (True), `ans = max(0, 6) = 6`
  - For `i = 7`: `n <= 420 // 7` (True), `ans = max(6, 7) = 7`
  - For `i = 10`: `n <= 420 // 10` (True), `ans = max(7, 10) = 10`
  - For `i = 21`: `n <= 420 // 21` (True), `ans = max(10, 21) = 21`
  - For `i = 35`: `n <= 420 // 35` (True), `ans = max(21, 35) = 35`
  - For `i = 60`: `n <= 420 // 60` (True), `ans = max(35, 60) = 60`
  - For `i = 70`: `n <= 420 // 70` (True), `ans = max(60, 70) = 70`
  - For `i = 105`: `n <= 420 // 105` (True), `ans = max(70, 105) = 105`
  - For `i = 140`: `n <= 420 // 140` (True), `ans = max(105, 140) = 140`
  - For `i = 210`: `n <= 420 // 210` (True), `ans = max(140, 210) = 210`
  - For `i = 420`: `n <= 420` (True), `ans = max(210, 1) = 210`
  - Final `ans = 6` (Note: The maximum value that satisfies the conditions is 6, as `6 * 70 = 420` and `n = 69`)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking the problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The logic and conditions used are appropriate for the problem statement.
