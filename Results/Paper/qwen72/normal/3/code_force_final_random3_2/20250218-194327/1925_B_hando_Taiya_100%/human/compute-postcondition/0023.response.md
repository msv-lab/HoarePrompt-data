Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is the largest integer such that `i * i <= x`. If `x` is divisible by any integer `i` in the range 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`, and if `n` <= `x // i` or `n` <= `i`, then `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies these conditions. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = isqrt(x) + 1`, where `isqrt(x)` is the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= x`.
- For each `i` in this range, the loop checks if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
- If `x` is divisible by `i`, the loop then checks two conditions:
  1. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
  2. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
- The loop continues until `i` exceeds `isqrt(x)`.
- After the loop finishes, `ans` will be the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions `x % i == 0` and either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`. If no such `i` is found, `ans` remains 0.
