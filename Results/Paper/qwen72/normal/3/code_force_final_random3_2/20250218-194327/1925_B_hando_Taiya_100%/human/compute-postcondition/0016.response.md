Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), and if `n` <= 2, then `ans` is the maximum value between 0, 1, `x // 2`, and 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` remains 0.***
