Output State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` in `S` represents the cumulative count of '0's and non-'0's (respectively) in the string `a` up to the corresponding character.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as the initial input.
- The variable `a` remains the same as the initial input string, which must have at least `n` characters.
- The list `S` will have `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` in `S` shows how many '0's and non-'0's (respectively) have been encountered in the string `a` up to that point. The final sublist in `S` will contain the total counts of '0's and non-'0's in the entire string `a`.
