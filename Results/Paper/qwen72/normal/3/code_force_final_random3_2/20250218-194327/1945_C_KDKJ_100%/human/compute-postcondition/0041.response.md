Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 1`, `ans` is -1**

Explanation:
- The code `rsum = n - i` updates the value of `rsum` to `n - 1`.
- `n` is at least 1, and `i` is 1, so `rsum` becomes `n - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
