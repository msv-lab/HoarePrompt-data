Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n`. Additionally, either `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables.
- The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
- All other initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
