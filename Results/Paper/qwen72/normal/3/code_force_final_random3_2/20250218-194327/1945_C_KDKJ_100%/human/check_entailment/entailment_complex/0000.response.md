Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the standard input.
   - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]`, which will be used to store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a`.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `a`, updating the cumulative counts and appending them to `S`.
   - It then iterates over all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n` inclusive) to find a valid position for the road. A position `i` is valid if:
     - The number of '0's on the left side (up to and including the `i`-th house) is at least half of the number of houses on the left side.
     - The number of '1's on the right side (from the `i+1`-th house to the end) is at least half of the number of houses on the right side.
   - It selects the valid position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village (i.e., minimizes `abs(n / 2 - i)`).
   - If no valid position is found, it prints `-1`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, each time processing a new test case.

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The input format is correctly handled by both functions. `func_2` reads the number of test cases, and `func_1` reads the number of houses and the string of preferences for each test case.
   - The output format is also correct. For each test case, `func_1` prints the position `i` where the road should be laid, or `-1` if no valid position exists.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the road is laid before the first house or after the last house.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the string `a` is entirely '0's or '1's.

5. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice.
   - The condition `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)` ensures that the selected position `i` is as close to the middle of the village as possible.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the problem's requirements.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
