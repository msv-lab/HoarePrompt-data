### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case. This is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Cumulative Count Calculation:**
   - In `func_1()`, the program calculates the cumulative count of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores it in the list `S`. This is done correctly by iterating through the string and updating the counts.
   - The list `S` is initialized with `[0, 0]` to handle the case where the road is laid before the first house.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program iterates through all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n`) to check if the road can be laid after the `i`-th house.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's on the left side (`left`) and the number of '1's on the right side (`right`).
   - It also calculates the total number of houses on the left side (`lsum`) and the right side (`rsum`).
   - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are used to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. If either condition fails, the program continues to the next position.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`n / 2`) than the previously stored answer `ans`. If so, it updates `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After checking all positions, the program prints the position `ans` where the road should be laid. This is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the road is laid before the first house or after the last house.
   - The program ensures that the answer always exists by initializing `ans` to -1 and updating it only when the conditions are met.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
