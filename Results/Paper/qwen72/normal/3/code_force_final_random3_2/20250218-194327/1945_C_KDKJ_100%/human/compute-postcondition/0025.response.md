To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer value input by the user.
- `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters.
- `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists.
- `ans` is -1.

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 0 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the initial value in the `range(n + 1)`.

State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1**
