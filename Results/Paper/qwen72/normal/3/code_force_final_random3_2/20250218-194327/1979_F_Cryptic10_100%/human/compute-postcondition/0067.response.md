Postcondition: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1` and `v2`, and `vx` must have at least 3 elements. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` appended to its previous contents, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `v3` is the first integer from the set `vx`, `_` is the second integer from the set `vx`, `v3` is removed from `vx`, `ops` now includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` in addition to its previous contents, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. In both cases, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, and `vx` has at least 1 element.**
