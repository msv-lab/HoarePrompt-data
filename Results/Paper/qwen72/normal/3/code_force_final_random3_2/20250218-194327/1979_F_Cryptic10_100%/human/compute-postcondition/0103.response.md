Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`, `v1`, and `v3`. `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the new tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is 0, `v3` is removed from `vx`, `v3` is assigned the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and the second value returned by `q` is ignored. `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` at the end of its current list. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is now `len(vx) - 2`, and `v2` is now the second value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. `v1` is removed from `vx`. `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.**
