Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v3` removed, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` where `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`**. 

The code appends the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain the same, and the set `vx` is also unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now contains the two tuples.
