To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`.
2. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.
3. `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
4. `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`p1` and `p2` Construction:**
   - `p1` starts with all integers from the set `vx`.
   - For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops`:
     - If the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) is not equal to `v2`, append `v1` to `p1`.
     - If the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, append `v1` to `p2`.

2. **`p1[::-1]` and `p2` Concatenation:**
   - `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`.
   - The reversed `p1` is then concatenated with `p2`.

3. **String Formatting:**
   - The `map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)` function converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
   - `' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))` joins these string elements with a space.
   - The resulting string is formatted into the print statement: `! %s`.

### Example Scenario:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `int(input())` is 5, so the original set of integers is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
- Suppose `vx` is `{2, 4}`.
- Suppose `ops` is `[(1, 4), (3, 2), (5, 4)]`.

**Constructing `p1` and `p2`:**
- `p1` starts as `[2, 4]`.
- For the first operation `(1, 4)`: `p1[-1]` is 4, which is equal to `v2`, so `1` is appended to `p2`. Now `p1` is `[2, 4]` and `p2` is `[1]`.
- For the second operation `(3, 2)`: `p1[-1]` is 4, which is not equal to `v2`, so `3` is appended to `p1`. Now `p1` is `[2, 4, 3]` and `p2` is `[1]`.
- For the third operation `(5, 4)`: `p1[-1]` is 3, which is not equal to `v2`, so `5` is appended to `p1`. Now `p1` is `[2, 4, 3, 5]` and `p2` is `[1]`.

**Reversing and Concatenating:**
- `p1[::-1]` is `[5, 3, 4, 2]`.
- Concatenating `p1[::-1]` with `p2` gives `[5, 3, 4, 2, 1]`.

**String Formatting:**
- `' '.join(map(str, [5, 3, 4, 2, 1]))` results in the string `"5 3 4 2 1"`.
- The final print statement is `! 5 3 4 2 1`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the operations, the output will be a string starting with `!` followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order and then the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces.

Output: **! [elements of p1 in reverse order] [elements of p2] (where p1 is a list containing all integers from the set vx plus any v1 values appended from ops where p1[-1] != v2, and p2 is a list containing any v1 values appended from ops where p1[-1] == v2)**

In the example scenario, the output would be:
Output: **! 5 3 4 2 1**
