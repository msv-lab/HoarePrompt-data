The loop head in this case is only the range defined by `int(input())`. The loop control variable `_` is not used within the loop, and the loop's continuation is solely dependent on the value of `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`.
- `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that can be adjusted is the number of iterations remaining, which is determined by the value of `int(input())`. Since the loop has already executed once, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred.

State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 1**.
