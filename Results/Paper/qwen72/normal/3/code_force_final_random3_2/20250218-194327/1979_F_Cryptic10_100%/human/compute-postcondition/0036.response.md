The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`. The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops`, so to execute one more time, the list `ops` must contain at least one more tuple, and the values of `v1` and `v2` will be the values of the next tuple in the reversed list `ops`.

At the end of the last iteration, `v1` and `v2` were the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`, and `ops` must contain at least two tuples. For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, and `v1` and `v2` will be the values of the third-to-last tuple in `ops`.

State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2` or `p2` remains an empty list if `p1[-1] != v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the third-to-last tuple in `ops`. If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` now contains `v1`. If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` now contains an additional element `v1`.**
