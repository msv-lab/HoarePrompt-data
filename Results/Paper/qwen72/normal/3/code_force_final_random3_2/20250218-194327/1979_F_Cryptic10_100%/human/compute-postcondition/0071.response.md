Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing the first element of the reversed `ops` list, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `v1` and `v2` are the first elements of the reversed `ops` list, `p1` or `p2` has been appended with `v1`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `v1` to `p2` if the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`.
- If `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `vx`, `ops`, and `int(input())` remain unchanged.
- The value of `p2` remains an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`.
- The value of `p1` or `p2` is updated by appending `v1` to it.
