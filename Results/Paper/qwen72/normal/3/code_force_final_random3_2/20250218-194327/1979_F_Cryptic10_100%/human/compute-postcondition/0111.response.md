Output State: **`vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations, `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop that must have at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list that may contain one element if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the second-to-last tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `p1` now contains the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`; if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `p2` now contains the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`.**
