Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration (which is currently an empty list).
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`. `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`. `v2` is either greater than 0 or 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2` and `v1`. `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the new tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is 0, `v3` is removed from `vx`, `v3` is assigned the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and the second value returned by `q` is ignored. `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` at the end of its current list. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is now `len(vx) - 2`, and `v2` is now the second value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2` and either `v1` or `v3`. `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` twice, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. If `v2` is 0, `v3` is removed from `vx`, `v3` is assigned the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and the second value returned by `q` is ignored. `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` at the end. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is `len(vx) - 2`, and `v2` is the second value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
