Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code redefines `vx` as a set containing integers from 1 to the value of `int(input())` inclusive.
- `ops` is initialized as an empty list.
- The initial state conditions for `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
