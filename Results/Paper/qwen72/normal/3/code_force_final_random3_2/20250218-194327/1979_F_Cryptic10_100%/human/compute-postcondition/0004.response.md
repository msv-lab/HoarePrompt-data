Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, inclusive, `ops` is an empty list, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` where `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`.**

Explanation:
- `int(input())` must be greater than 2, and this condition remains unchanged.
- `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, inclusive, and this set remains unchanged.
- `ops` is an empty list, and this remains unchanged.
- `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by the function `q(len(vx) - 2)`. Since `len(vx)` is equal to `int(input())`, `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`. Therefore, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(int(input()) - 2)`.
