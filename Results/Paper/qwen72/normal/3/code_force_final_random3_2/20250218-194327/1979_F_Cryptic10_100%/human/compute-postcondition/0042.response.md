The only variable in the loop head is `vx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `vx`. If `len(vx)` is greater than 2, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive. For the loop to execute the first time, `vx` must contain more than 2 integers.

State: **`vx` is a set containing more than 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
