Output State: **`vx` is a set containing more than 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1`. `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1. `v1` and `v2` are the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`. The current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The tuple `(v1, v2)` is appended to the list `ops`.
- The values of `vx`, `p1`, `p2`, `int(input())`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
- The list `ops` now contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`.
