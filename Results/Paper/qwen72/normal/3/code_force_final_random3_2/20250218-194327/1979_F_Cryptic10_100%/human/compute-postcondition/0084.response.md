Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`. `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`. `v2` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`.
- `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`, which remains unchanged.
- `v2` is greater than 0, which remains unchanged.
- `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`, which remains unchanged.
- `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, which remains unchanged.
- `p2` is an empty list, which remains unchanged.
- `ops` is now a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`.
