Output State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the contents of the set `vx` to the list `p1` and initializes `p2` as an empty list. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
