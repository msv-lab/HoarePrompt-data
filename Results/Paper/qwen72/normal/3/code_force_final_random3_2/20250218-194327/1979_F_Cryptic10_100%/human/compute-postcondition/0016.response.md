Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` removed, and `int(input())` must be at least 4. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, where `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the tuple `(v1, v2)` is appended to `ops`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v3` removed, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and the tuple `(v1, v2)` is appended to `ops`.**
