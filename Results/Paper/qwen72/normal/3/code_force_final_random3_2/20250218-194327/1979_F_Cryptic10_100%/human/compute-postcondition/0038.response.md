Output State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `p1` will still contain all the integers from the set `vx`, but it will also have additional elements `v1` appended to it for each iteration where the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) was not equal to `v2`.
- The list `p2` will contain elements `v1` appended to it for each iteration where the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) was equal to `v2`.
- The set `vx` remains unchanged and contains exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- The list `ops` remains unchanged and contains the tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration.
