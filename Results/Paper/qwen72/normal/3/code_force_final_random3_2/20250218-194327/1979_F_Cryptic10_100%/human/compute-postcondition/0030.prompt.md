Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, inclusive, and `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` removed. `ops` is an empty list if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 and `v3` is not defined. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v3` removed, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` where `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `int(input())` is greater than 2 and at least 4. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` removed. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, where `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the tuple `(v1, v2)` is appended to `ops`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, and `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v3` removed. `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)`, `(v1, 0)`, and the tuple `(v1, v2)` is appended to `ops` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`int(input())` is greater than 2 and at least 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v2` removed, and `len(vx) > 1`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` also has `v3` removed, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` is a list that includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
