Postcondition: ***`int(input())` is greater than 2 and at least 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v2` removed, and `len(vx) > 1`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` also has `v3` removed, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` is a list that includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.***
