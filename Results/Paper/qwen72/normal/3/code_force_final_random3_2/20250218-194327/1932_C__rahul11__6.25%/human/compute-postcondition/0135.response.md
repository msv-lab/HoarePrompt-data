The code snippet `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` updates the value of `ans` based on the integer division of `ans` by `arr[l]` and then takes the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `l` is incremented by 2 in the initial state, but the code snippet provided does not include this increment. Therefore, `l` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same.**
