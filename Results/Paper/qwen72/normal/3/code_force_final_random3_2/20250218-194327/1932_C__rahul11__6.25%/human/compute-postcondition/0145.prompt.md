Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string s of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `MOD` is now 1000000006.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[c]` updated to `ans % m % MOD` for each `c` from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integers in `arr` that were removed according to the characters in `s`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `c` is `n`, and `k` is `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element from `res[1]` to `res[n-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except those that have been divided out based on the characters in `s`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` from the beginning to `n-2`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `c` is `n`, `k` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is `n - 1`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration, and `ans` is the final value after all divisions and modulo operations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
