Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[c]` updated to `ans % m % MOD` for each `c` from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integers in `arr` that were removed according to the characters in `s`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the new `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in the new `s`, `c` is `n`, and `k` is `n - 1`.**
