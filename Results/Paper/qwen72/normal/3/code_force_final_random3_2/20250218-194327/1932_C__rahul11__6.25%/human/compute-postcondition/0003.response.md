The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arr`. The variables `_`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
