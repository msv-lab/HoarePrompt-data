Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, `c` is increased by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `res[c]`, `ans`, `m`, `s[k]`, `arr[l]`, `arr[r]`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for updating `ans` and `l` or `r` based on `s[k]` are still valid.
- The initial state information that `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, and the updates to `res[c]`, `ans`, `l`, and `r` based on `s[k]` are still applicable.
