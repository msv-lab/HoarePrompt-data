Output State: **_ is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in the new `s`, `c` is 1, and `k` is `n - 1`.**

The value of `l` is set to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. The initial state information for `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `k` is still valid.
