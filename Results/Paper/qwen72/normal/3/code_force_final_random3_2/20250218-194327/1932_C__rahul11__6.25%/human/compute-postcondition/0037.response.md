Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros. If `s[k]` is 'L', `res[0]`, `res[1]`, and `res[2]` are set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` except `arr[l]` divided by `arr[l]` and then taken modulo `MOD`, `l` is 2, and `r` is `n - 1`. If `s[k]` is not 'L', `res[0]` and `res[1]` are set to `ans % m % MOD`, `res[2]` is also set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `i` is the last integer in `arr`. In both cases, `k` is 1, `c` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
