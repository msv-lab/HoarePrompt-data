The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` will take the value of the first integer in `arr` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string
- `res` is a list of `n` zeros
- `ans` is 1

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one integer, and `i` must be the first integer in `arr`.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 1, `i` is the first integer in `arr`**
