Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, the character at the `k`-th index of `s` is not 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans` using the expression `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and the character at the `k`-th index of `s` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is the result of integer division of `ans` by `arr[r]`, followed by taking the modulus of the result with `MOD`.
