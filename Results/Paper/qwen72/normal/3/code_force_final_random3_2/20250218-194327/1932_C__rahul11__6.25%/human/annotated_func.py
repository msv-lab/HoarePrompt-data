#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string s of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(input())
        
        res = [0] * n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        
        c = 1
        
        l = 0
        
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: _ is t-1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the final input, `s` is a list of characters from the final input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration, `ans` is the final value after all divisions and modulo operations, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `c` is `n`, and `k` is `n - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of `n` integers `arr` (1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^4), and a string `s` of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a list `res` of `n` integers. The first element of `res` is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. Subsequent elements in `res` are calculated by iteratively dividing the current product by the corresponding element in `arr` based on the direction specified by `s` ('L' or 'R'), and then taking the result modulo `m` and `10^9 + 6`. The function prints the list `res` for each test case.
