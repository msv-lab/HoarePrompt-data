Output State: **_ is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is equal to the product of all integers in `arr`, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 1.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `c` to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
