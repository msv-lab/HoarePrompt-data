Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `c` is 1, `k` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1, and the first element of `s` is not 'L'**
