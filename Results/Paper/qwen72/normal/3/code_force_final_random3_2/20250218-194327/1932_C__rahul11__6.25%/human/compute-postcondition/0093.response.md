Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros. If `s[k]` is 'L', `res[0]`, `res[1]`, `res[2]`, and `res[3]` are updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[3] % MOD`, `l` is 3, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `res[0]`, `res[1]`, `res[2]`, and `res[3]` are updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` remains the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[r]` modulo `MOD` where `r` is `n - 3`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 4`. In both cases, `c` is 3, `k` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
