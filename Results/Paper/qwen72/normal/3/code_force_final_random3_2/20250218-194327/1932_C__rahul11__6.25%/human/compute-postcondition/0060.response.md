Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `i * i * i`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the new `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in the new `s`, `c` is `n`, `k` is `n - 1`, `i` is the third element of `arr`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `ans` was initially `i * i`, after the multiplication, `ans` becomes `i * i * i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
