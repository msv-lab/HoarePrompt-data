Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100 and x is greater than or equal to k, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, and `s` is the second line of the file. `i` is 1, `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The value of `z` is increased by the integer division of `z` by `k - 1` plus 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
