The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'YES'`.
- The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The file opened by `open(0)` is mentioned, but the content of the file does not affect the `print` statement since it is not read or used in the code snippet.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
