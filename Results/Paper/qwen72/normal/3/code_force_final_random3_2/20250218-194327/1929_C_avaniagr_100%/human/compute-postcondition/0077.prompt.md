Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, and `s` is the second line of the file. If `x < k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x >= k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 2`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k`, then after all iterations, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the current value of `a` remains greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, the current value of `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer in the third line of the file, `x` is the second integer in the third line of the file, `a` is the third integer in the third line of the file, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 3 lines, and `s` is the third line of the file. If `x` < `k` - 1, and if `a` >= `x` + 1, no changes are made to `a` and `x`. If `x` >= `k` - 1, and if `x` == `k` - 1, no variables are modified. Otherwise, `z` is now the result of the loop expression after `x - k + 3` iterations, `x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, no changes are made to `a` and `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, no changes are made to `a` and `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer in the fourth line of the file, `x` is the second integer in the fourth line of the file, `a` is the third integer in the fourth line of the file, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 4 lines, and `s` is the fourth line of the file. If `x < k - 1`, the program continues with the variables retaining their values. If `x == k - 1`, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x != k - 1` and `x` is at least `k - 3`, `z` is the result of the loop after `x - k + 3` iterations, where each iteration updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is `x - k + 2`. In this case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
