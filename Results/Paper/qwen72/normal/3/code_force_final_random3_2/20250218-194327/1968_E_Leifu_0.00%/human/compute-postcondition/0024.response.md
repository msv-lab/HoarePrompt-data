Based on the initial state provided:
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.

The print statement is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break it down step by step:
1. `j` is 4.
2. `str(j)` converts `j` to a string, resulting in `'4'`.
3. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string `'4'`, a space `' '`, and the string `'4'` again.
4. This results in the string `'4 4'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **4 4**
