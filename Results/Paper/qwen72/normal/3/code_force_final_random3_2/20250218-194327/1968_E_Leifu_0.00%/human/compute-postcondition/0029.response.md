Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to the input integer `n`, which must be at least 4 for the loop to execute at least once. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
