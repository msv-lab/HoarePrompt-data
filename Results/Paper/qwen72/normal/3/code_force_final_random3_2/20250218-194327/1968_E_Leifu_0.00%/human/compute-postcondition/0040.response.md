Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 5.

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 5.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `'5'`.
3. The `print` statement concatenates the string `'5'` with a space `' '` and another `'5'`.
4. The final concatenated string is `'5 5'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **5 5**
