Based on the initial state provided:
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `j` is 4.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down the execution of this print statement:
1. `str(j)` converts the integer `j` to a string. Since `j` is 4, `str(j)` will be `'4'`.
2. The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings. Therefore, `'4' + ' ' + '4'` will result in the string `'4 4'`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
Output: **4 4**
