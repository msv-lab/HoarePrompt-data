Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[0]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[0]` of the list `q` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `q` initially consists of `n + 1` zeros, and after the execution, the element at the index `w[0]` is incremented by 1.
