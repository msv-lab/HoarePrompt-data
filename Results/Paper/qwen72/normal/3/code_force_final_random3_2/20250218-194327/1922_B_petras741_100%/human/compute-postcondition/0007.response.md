The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is already specified to be greater than or equal to 3, the loop will execute without needing to adjust `n`. However, the initial state of `j` needs to be set to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `j` is 0**
