Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `q[w[0]]` which is 1 and `q[w[1]]` which is now 1, `j` is 1**

The value of `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
