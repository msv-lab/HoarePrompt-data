Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` must be greater than 3, `rho` is the count of how many times `eta[0]` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times `eta[1]` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times `eta[2]` appears in `w`, `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6`.** 

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the expression `q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6` to it. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
