Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `q[w[0]]` which is now 1, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[0]` in the list `q` by 1. Since `j` is 0, `w[j]` refers to the first element of the list `w`. The list `q` was initially initialized with all elements set to 0, so the element at index `w[0]` in `q` is now 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
