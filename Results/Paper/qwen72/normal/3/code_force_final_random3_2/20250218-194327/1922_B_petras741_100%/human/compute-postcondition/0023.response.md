Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing the value 1 and the value 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is 2.
- The list `eta` initially contains the value 1 if `q[j]` (where `j` is 2) is greater than 0.
- The code `eta.append(j)` adds the value of `j` (which is 2) to the list `eta`.
- Therefore, `eta` now contains the values 1 and 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
