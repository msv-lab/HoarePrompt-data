The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, and the list `w`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the input integer that must be at least 0
- `w` is a list of integers input by the user
- `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1
- `j` is 1
- `eta` is a list. If `q[1]` is greater than 0, `eta` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `eta` is an empty list

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 2
- `n` must remain the same, so `n` is still the input integer that must be at least 0

The state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, and `eta` is a list. If `q[1]` is greater than 0, `eta` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `eta` is an empty list.**
