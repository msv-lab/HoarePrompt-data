The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be greater than 0, which is already ensured because `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, `n + 1` will always be at least 4, ensuring the loop will execute.

Before the loop starts, `j` is `n-1`. However, for the loop to execute correctly, `j` should be initialized to 0, as the loop will iterate from 0 to `n`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**
