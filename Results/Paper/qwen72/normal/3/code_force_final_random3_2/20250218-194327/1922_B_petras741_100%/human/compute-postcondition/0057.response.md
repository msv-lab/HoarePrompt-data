The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except for the element at index `w[0]`, which is now 1, `j` is 1**
