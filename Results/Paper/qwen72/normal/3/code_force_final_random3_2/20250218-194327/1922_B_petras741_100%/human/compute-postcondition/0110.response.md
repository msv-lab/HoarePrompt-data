The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the expression `n + 1`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 0. The variable `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `w` is a list of integers input by the user
- `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`
- `j` is `n - 1`
- `eta` is an empty list

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `j` and `n` in the loop head. Specifically, `n` must be at least 0, and `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**
