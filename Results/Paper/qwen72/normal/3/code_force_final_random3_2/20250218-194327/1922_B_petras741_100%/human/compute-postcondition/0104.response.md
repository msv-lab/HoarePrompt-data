The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `q[w[0]]` which is now 1, `j` is 1**
