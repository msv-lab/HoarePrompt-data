The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each `a_i` represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick, 2^{a_i}. The input must be provided in the format described, and the sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It processes these inputs to determine the lengths of the sticks based on the exponents provided and returns a result for each test case.**
