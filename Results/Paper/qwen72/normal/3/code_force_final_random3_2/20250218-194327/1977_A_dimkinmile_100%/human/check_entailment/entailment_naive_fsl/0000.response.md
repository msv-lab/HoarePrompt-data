Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and output format as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1()` is called inside the loop, but the function itself is defined after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because `func_1()` is called before it is defined. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n < m`, which should always return "No" because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves made.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```
The program will fail because `func_1()` is called before it is defined, leading to a runtime error. Even if this issue is fixed, the program will still return incorrect results for the second test case (`2 4`), as it should return "No" but the current logic does not account for this scenario.
