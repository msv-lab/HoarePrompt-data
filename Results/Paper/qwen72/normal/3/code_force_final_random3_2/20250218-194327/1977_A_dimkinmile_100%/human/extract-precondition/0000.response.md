Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and the pairs of n and m for each test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing two integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
