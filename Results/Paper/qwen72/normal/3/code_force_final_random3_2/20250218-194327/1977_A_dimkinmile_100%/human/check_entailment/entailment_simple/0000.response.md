Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, given the constraints. Let's break down the logic and the program to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then checks if the difference `(n - m)` is a non-negative even number.
   - If the condition is met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Logic Explanation:**
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower.
   - To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of times Nikita adds a cube must be exactly `m` more than the number of times he removes a cube.
   - This can be expressed as: `n = (number of additions) + (number of removals)` and `m = (number of additions) - (number of removals)`.
   - Combining these equations, we get: `n + m = 2 * (number of additions)`.
   - Therefore, `n + m` must be even for the solution to be possible.
   - Additionally, `n` must be at least `m` because you cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

4. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` is equivalent to checking if `n + m` is even and `n >= m`.
   - If `n - m` is non-negative and even, then `n + m` is also even, and the number of additions is sufficient to reach `m` cubes.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case `3 3`:
     - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - `n - m = 0` (which is even and non-negative)
     - The function prints "Yes", which is correct.
   - For the test case `2 4`:
     - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - `n - m = -2` (which is negative)
     - The function prints "No", which is correct.
   - For the test case `5 3`:
     - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - `n - m = 2` (which is even and non-negative)
     - The function prints "Yes", which is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles the problem and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
