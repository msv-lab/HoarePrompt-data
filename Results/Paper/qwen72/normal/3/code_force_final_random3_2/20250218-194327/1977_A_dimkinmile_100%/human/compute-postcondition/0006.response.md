The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases and is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if `n` is less than or equal to `m`, the function returns "n is less than or equal to m"; otherwise, it returns "n is greater than m".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 100), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers (1 <= n, m <= 100). The function returns a list of results, where each result is a string indicating whether `n` is less than or equal to `m` or whether `n` is greater than `m` for each test case.**
