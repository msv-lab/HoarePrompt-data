### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves must be even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes needed. This is because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves if you are only adding or removing one cube per move.

4. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func_1()` is called `kreker` times, and each call should handle a new test case.
  - The function should read two integers, `n` and `m`, where both are within the range 1 to 100.

- **Inside `func_1()`:**
  - The function reads `n` and `m` from the input.
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
  - The condition `n - m >= 0` checks if the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes needed.
  - If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Validation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and reasoning behind the program.
- The conditions `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` are indeed necessary and sufficient to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases and then calling `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
