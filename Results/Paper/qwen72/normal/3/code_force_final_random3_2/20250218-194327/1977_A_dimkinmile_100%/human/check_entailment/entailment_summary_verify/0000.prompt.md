You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the user input, where both `n` and `m` are expected to be within the range 1 to 100. The function then checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is a non-negative even number. If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The final state of the program is that the values of `n` and `m` are unchanged, and the output is either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and output format as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1()` is called inside the loop, but the function itself is defined after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because `func_1()` is called before it is defined. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n < m`, which should always return "No" because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves made.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```
The program will fail because `func_1()` is called before it is defined, leading to a runtime error. Even if this issue is fixed, the program will still return incorrect results for the second test case (`2 4`), as it should return "No" but the current logic does not account for this scenario.
