Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min` and greater than `Max` or `Min` depending on the condition, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The variables `Min` and `Max` are updated based on the values of `n` and `k`. `Min` is assigned the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is assigned the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`) remain unchanged.
