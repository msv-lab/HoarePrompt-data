Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `number`, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- `rep` is incremented by 1, so `rep` is now 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is still `n - Min * Max` as it was updated in the initial state.
