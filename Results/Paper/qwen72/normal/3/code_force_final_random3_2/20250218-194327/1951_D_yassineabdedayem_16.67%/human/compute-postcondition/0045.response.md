Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of `number` values.
   - `i` is the second element of `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is defined as the second element of the list `tab`.
   - `tab` is a list that contains at least two string representations of `number` values.
   - Since `i` is the second element of `tab`, it will be one of these string representations.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of `tab` followed by a space (as specified by `end=' '`).

Given that `i` is the second element of `tab`, and `tab` contains string representations of `number` values, the output will be the second string in `tab` followed by a space.

Output: **[second element of tab] **

Where `[second element of tab]` is the string representation of the second number in the list `tab`.
