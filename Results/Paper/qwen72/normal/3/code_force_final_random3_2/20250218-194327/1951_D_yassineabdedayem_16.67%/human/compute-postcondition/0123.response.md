Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `Min`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`, and `k` is `k - Max`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
