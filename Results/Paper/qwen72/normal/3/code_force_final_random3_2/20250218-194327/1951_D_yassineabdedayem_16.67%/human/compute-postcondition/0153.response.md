Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop. If `k` is 0, `tab` must have at least `rep` elements, and `i` is the last element of `tab`. If `k` is a positive integer, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop.***
