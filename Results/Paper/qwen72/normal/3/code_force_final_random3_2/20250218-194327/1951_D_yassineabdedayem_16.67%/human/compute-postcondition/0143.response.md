Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(len(tab))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `rep` indicates the number of times the loop executed, and it is at most 60.
   - The list `tab` contains the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop.
   - Since `rep` is the number of times the loop executed, the length of `tab` will be equal to `rep`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(len(tab))` statement will print the number of elements in the list `tab`.
   - Given that `rep` is the number of times the loop executed and `tab` contains one element for each iteration, the length of `tab` will be `rep`.

Output: **rep (where rep is the number of times the loop executed, which is at most 60)**
