Output State: **`Min` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the larger of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, `number` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k`, and `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is equal to `Max`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`. `tab` is a list that now includes the string representation of `number`. `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `k` remain as they were defined in the initial state.
- The list `tab` still includes the string representation of `number`.
