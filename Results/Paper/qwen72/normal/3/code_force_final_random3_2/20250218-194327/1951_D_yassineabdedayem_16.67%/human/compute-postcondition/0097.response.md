The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again with the next element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of numbers, and `i` is the second element of `tab`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must contain at least 3 string representations of numbers, and `i` will be the third element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing at least 3 string representations of numbers, `i` is the third element of `tab`**
