Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string representations of numbers, and the loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` could be 0 or a non-zero integer, depending on the final state of the loop.
- The variable `k` could be 0 or a positive integer, depending on the final state of the loop.
- The variable `rep` is the number of times the loop has executed, which is 60 or less.
- The variable `tab` is a list that contains up to 60 string representations of numbers, each representing the value of `number` during each iteration of the loop.
- The loop has stopped because one of the following conditions is no longer true: `n` is not equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, or `rep` is less than 60.
