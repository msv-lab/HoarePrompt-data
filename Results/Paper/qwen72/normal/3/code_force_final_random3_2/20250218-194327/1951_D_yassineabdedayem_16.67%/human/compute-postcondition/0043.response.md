Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a `number` value.
   - `i` is the first element of `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `i` is the first element of the list `tab`.
   - Since `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a `number` value, `i` will be the string representation of the first `number` value in `tab`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of `tab` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Given the initial state, the first element of `tab` is a string representation of a `number` value. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the string representation of the first `number` value in the `tab` list)**
