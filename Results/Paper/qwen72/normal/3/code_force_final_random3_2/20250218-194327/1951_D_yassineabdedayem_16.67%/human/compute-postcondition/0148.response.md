The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` must have at least one element, and `i` is the second element of `tab`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the next (third) element in the list.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60), `tab` must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `tab`**
