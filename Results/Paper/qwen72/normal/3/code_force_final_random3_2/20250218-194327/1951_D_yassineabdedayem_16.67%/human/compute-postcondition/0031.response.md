Output State: **`Min` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the larger of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k`, `k` is `k - Max`.**

Explanation:
- `Min` remains the smaller of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` remains the larger of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- `number` remains the smaller of `n // k` and `k`.
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
