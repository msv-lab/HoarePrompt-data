Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `n - Min * Max` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing three string representations, `k` is updated to `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min`. `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. `number` is set to `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is set to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `tab` is a list containing two string representations.
- The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- After execution, `tab` now contains three string representations.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the conditions and logic for updating `k` and setting `number` are still valid.
- The output state reflects the updated list `tab` and maintains all other conditions and variable values from the initial state.
