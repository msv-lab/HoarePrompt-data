Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `number` is `Min` and `k` is `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `k`, `Min`, and `Max` still hold true.
- The conditions for `number` and `k` based on the values of `Max` and `Min` remain the same.
