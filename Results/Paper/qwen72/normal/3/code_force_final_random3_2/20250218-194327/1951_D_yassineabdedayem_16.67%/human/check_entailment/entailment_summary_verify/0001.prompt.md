You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it attempts to decompose `n` into a sum of products of two integers, where one integer is at most `k` and the other is a divisor of `n`. The function records these products in a list `tab` and stops after 60 iterations or when `n` cannot be further decomposed under the given constraints. If `k` is reduced to 0, the function prints "YES" followed by the number of elements in `tab` and the elements themselves. If `k` is not 0, the function prints "NO". After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, `n` is 0 or a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, and `rep` is the total number of times the loop executed (at most 60).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Loop Initialization**: The program initializes variables `rep` (which counts the number of stalls), `number` (which will store the price of the current stall), and `tab` (which will store the prices of the stalls).

3. **Stall Setup Loop**: The program enters a loop that continues as long as:
   - `n` (the remaining coins) is not zero.
   - `k` (the remaining jewels to be bought) is greater than zero.
   - `rep` (the number of stalls set up) is less than 60.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Price Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and decreases `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and decreases `k` by `Min`.

5. **Update Variables**:
   - The price `number` is appended to the list `tab`.
   - The remaining coins `n` are decreased by `Min * Max`.
   - The stall count `rep` is incremented by 1.

6. **Output**:
   - If `k` is zero after the loop, it means Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not zero, it means it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The loop ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
  - The prices are set such that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall, and the remaining coins are adjusted accordingly.
  - The condition `n * Min <= k` ensures that the price is set in a way that Alice can buy the required number of jewels without exceeding the total number of coins.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by exiting the loop early and printing "NO".
  - The program also handles the case where `k` is zero after the loop, indicating that the task is possible.

- **Example Verification**:
  - For the first test case (n=7, k=3):
    - The program sets up 10 stalls with prices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
    - Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall and is left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.
  - For the second test case (n=6, k=4):
    - The program correctly determines that it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels, and prints "NO".
  - For the third test case (n=255, k=8):
    - The program sets up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
    - Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, spending 255 coins in total and buying exactly 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and edge cases. It ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60 and that the prices are set such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels if possible.
