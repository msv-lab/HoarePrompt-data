Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in Stall Pricing**: The logic for setting the prices of the stalls and the number of jewels Alice buys from each stall is flawed. The program tries to set prices based on the division of `n` by `k`, but this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The program should ensure that the total number of jewels bought by Alice is exactly `k`, and the prices should be set accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Stall Limits**: The program does not correctly handle the constraint that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. The loop condition `(rep < 60)` is correct, but the logic inside the loop does not ensure that the number of stalls is minimized or that the prices are set in a way that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program prints the prices of the stalls in a single line, but the problem description specifies that the prices should be printed on a single line separated by spaces. The current implementation uses `print(i, end=' ')` which will print the prices correctly, but it does not print a newline after the prices, which is required to match the expected output format.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `k` is 1, the program should be able to set up a single stall with a price of `n` coins, ensuring Alice buys exactly one jewel. However, the current logic may fail in such cases.

A correct approach would involve setting up stalls in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One simple and effective strategy is to set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin, and then set up additional stalls with prices that Alice cannot afford to buy from, ensuring that she buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > 60:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            print(1, end=' ')
        print()  # Ensure a newline after the prices

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that:
- If `k` is greater than 60, it prints "NO" because Bob cannot set up more than 60 stalls.
- Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The prices are printed on a single line with spaces separating them, followed by a newline.

This approach is simple and guarantees the correct output for the given problem constraints.
