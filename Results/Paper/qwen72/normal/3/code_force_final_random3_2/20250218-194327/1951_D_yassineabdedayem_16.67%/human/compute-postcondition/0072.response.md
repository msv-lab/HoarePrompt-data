Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is `k - Max`, `k` must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is equal to `Min`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than `Min` is still valid.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` is still valid.
