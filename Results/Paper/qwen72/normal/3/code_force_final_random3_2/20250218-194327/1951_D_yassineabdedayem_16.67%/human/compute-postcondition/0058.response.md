Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `k` must be a positive integer, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- `Min` is assigned the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is assigned the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- The values of `t`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `n` and `k` (non-zero, positive, and `n` â‰¥ `k`) are still valid.
