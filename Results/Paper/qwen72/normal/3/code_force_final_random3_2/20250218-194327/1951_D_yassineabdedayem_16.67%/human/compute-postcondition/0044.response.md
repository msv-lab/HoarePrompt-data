The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `tab` must have at least one more element after the current one. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `tab`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the second element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of `number` values, `i` is the second element of `tab`**
