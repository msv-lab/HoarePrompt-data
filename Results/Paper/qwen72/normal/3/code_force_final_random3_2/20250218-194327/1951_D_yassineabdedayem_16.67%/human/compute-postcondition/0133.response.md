Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `Min` and `Max` depend on the current values of `n` and `k`, but their definitions are still valid.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representations of `number` and the updated `number`.
- The conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` being greater than 0, `Min * Max`, and `Min` or `Max` respectively, are still valid.
