To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(tab))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the loop logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop.
   - `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop runs for `rep` iterations.
   - In each iteration, `Min` and `Max` are computed, and `number` is set to the last value of either `Min` or `Max`.
   - The string representation of `number` is appended to the list `tab`.
   - `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.

3. **Determine the Length of `tab`:**
   - Since `tab` is a list that appends the string representation of `number` in each iteration, and the loop runs for `rep` iterations, the length of `tab` will be equal to `rep`.

Given that `rep` is 60 or less, the length of `tab` will be exactly `rep`.

Output: **rep (where rep is the number of iterations, which is 60 or less)**
