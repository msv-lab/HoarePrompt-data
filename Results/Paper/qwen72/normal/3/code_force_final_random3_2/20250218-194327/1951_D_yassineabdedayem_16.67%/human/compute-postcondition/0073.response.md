Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `number` is equal to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `number = Max` assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`.
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions (`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than or equal to `k`) are still valid after the code execution.
