Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the actual implementation should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. `test_cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is guaranteed that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.**
