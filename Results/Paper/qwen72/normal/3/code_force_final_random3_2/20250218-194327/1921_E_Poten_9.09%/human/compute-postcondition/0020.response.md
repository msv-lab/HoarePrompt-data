Output State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. The third element of `clues` is not greater than the fifth element, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1, and the third and fifth elements of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element, the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element, and the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is 1 or less. Additionally, either the third element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, or the fifth element of `clues` minus the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` by 2.**
