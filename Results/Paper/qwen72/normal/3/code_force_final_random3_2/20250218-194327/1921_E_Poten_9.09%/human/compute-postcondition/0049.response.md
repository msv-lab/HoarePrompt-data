Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is an empty list, `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. The third element of `clues` is not greater than the fifth element, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element, the fourth element of `clues` is less than the fifth element, and the absolute difference between the fourth and fifth elements of `clues` is greater than 1. The current value of `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2, or the current value of `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2.**
