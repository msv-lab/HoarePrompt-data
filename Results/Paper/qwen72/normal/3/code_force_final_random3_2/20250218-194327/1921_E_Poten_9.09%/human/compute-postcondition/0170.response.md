Output State: **`i` is `test_cases` - 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing `test_cases` elements (each element is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), and all elements in `answers` have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as `test_cases` - 1.
- The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged as an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- The list `answers` contains the same number of elements as `test_cases`, and each element is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
- All elements in the `answers` list have been printed to the console.
