Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Bob' or 'Draw', `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1, and the third and fifth elements of `clues` are either both even or both odd. If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'. Otherwise, if `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2] and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, and either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and none of the above conditions are met, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw' if either the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, and either the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` is less than twice the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than twice the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and none of the above conditions are met, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'.***
