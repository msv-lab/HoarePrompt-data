Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Alice' or the string 'Draw', `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. The third element of `clues` is not greater than the fifth element, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and the condition `(clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, or if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1 and the condition `(clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
