The code snippet `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state does not specify the initial contents of `answers`, so we assume it could be an empty list or contain some elements. After appending `'Draw'`, the list `answers` will have at least one element, which is `'Draw'`. The other variables `i` and `test_cases` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `answers` is a list containing at least the string `'Draw'`.**
