Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 3, `same` is 1, `i` is 4 if `ar[3]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `i` is 3, `minn` is 1, `num` is `ar[4]` if `ar[3]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `num` is `ar[3]`.**

The code snippet sets `same` to 1, overriding its previous value. The value of `i` and `num` depend on whether `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`. If `ar[3]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `i` remains 3 and `num` remains `ar[3]`. Otherwise, `i` remains 4 and `num` remains `ar[4]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `minn` are not affected.
