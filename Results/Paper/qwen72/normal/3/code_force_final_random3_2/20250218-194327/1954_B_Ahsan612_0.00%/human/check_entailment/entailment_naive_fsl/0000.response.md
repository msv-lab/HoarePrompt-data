Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful and all elements are the same. According to the problem description, if all elements in the array are the same, it should be impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, and the output should be `-1`. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```

The expected output is `-1` because the array is already beautiful and consists of identical elements, making it impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect.
