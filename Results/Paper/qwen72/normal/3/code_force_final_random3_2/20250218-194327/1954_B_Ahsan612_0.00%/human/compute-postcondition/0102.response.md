Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `i` is now 4, `num` is now `ar[3]`, `same` remains 1, and `minn` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` does not change the value of `minn` because both `minn` and `same` are set to 1. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
