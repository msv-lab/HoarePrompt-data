Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is 1, and `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. If `minn` is `inf`, `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.***
