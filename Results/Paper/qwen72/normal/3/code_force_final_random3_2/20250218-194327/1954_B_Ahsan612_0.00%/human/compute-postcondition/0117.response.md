The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This code snippet simply prints the integer `-1`. The precondition provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `same`, and `minn`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the code is solely determined by the value `-1` that is being printed.

Output: **-1**
