Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), `same` is 4 and `i` is 3. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num` but `ar[i]` is not, `same` is 2, `i` is 5, and `num` is the element at index `i-1` of `ar`. If neither `ar[i-1]` nor `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 1, `i` is either 4 or 6, and `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`. `minn` is always 1.***
