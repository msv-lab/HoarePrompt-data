Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. The program should output `-1` if it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, otherwise, it should output the minimum number of elements to remove.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which will count the length of consecutive sequences of the same number.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity), which will store the minimum length of consecutive sequences.

3. **Loop through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array `ar` using a while loop.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it:
     - Increments `i` to skip the current element.
     - Updates `num` to the new element `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1 for the new sequence.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the final value of `same`.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means there were no consecutive sequences, and the program prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Incorrect Logic for Consecutive Sequences**:
  - The program only checks for consecutive sequences of the same number and updates `minn` with the minimum length of these sequences.
  - This logic does not correctly handle the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. The program should instead focus on finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

- **Handling of Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), outputting `-1`.
  - However, it does not correctly handle cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should output `1` because removing the last element makes the array non-beautiful, but the program's logic does not capture this.

- **Incorrect Update of `i`**:
  - The program increments `i` twice in some cases, which can lead to skipping elements and incorrect results.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.
2. Check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property
        minn = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                minn = min(minn, 1)
            else:
                minn = min(minn, 2)
        
        if minn == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property by checking each possible removal and updating `minn` accordingly.

Given the issues with the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
