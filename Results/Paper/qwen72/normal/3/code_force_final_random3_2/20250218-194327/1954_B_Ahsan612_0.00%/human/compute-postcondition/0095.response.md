Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `ar[1]` is not equal to `num`.**

The value of `same` is set to 1, which was already its initial value. Therefore, no changes occur in the state of the program. All other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
