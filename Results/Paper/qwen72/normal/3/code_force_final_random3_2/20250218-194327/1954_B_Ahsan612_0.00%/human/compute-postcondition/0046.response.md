Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is 1, `i` is 1, `minn` is `inf`, `num` is the first element of `ar`.**

The value of `i` has been updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `i` being equal to the length of `ar` is no longer valid, and it is now explicitly set to 1. The other variables retain their initial conditions: `t` is still within the specified range, `n` is still an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is still a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is still 1, `minn` is still `inf`, and `num` is still the first element of `ar`.
