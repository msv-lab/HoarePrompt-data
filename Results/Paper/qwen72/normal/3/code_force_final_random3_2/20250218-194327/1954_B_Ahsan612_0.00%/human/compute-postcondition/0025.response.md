To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < len(ar)`. The variables `i` and `len(ar)` are the ones that determine whether the loop will continue to run.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 3
- `minn` is 1
- `i` is 5
- `num` is `ar[4]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is 5, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `len(ar)` is greater than 5. No other adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 5, `minn` is 1, `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[4]`**
