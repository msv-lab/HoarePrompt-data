### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the array `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads the array `ar` for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity) to keep track of the minimum segment length of consecutive identical elements.

3. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop with index `i`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments the `same` counter.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it:
     - Increments `i` by 1 to move to the next element.
     - Updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1 to start counting the new segment of identical elements.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to account for the last segment of identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements.
- It updates `minn` to the minimum length of these segments.
- If the array consists of all identical elements, `minn` will remain `inf`, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- If the array has segments of different lengths, the program outputs the length of the smallest segment, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements are the Same:**
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` because removing any number of elements will not change the fact that all elements are the same.
- **Array with Multiple Segments:**
  - The program correctly identifies the smallest segment and outputs its length.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Increment of `i` in the `else` block:**
  - In the `else` block, the program increments `i` by 1 before updating `num` to `ar[i]`. This can lead to an `IndexError` if `i` becomes equal to `len(ar)` before the assignment `num = ar[i]` is executed.
  - The correct approach should be to update `num` to `ar[i]` and then increment `i` by 1.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was mostly accurate in its reasoning and analysis.
- However, the original code has a potential `IndexError` due to the incorrect increment of `i` in the `else` block.
- After correcting this issue, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Final: **False** (due to the potential `IndexError` in the original code)
