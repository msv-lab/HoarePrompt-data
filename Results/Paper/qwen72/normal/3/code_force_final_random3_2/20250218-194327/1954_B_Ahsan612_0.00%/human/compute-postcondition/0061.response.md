Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`, `same` is 1, `i` is 4.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value (1) and `same` (1). Since both values are 1, `minn` remains 1.
- `same` is 1, and `i` is 4, as specified in the initial state.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged.
- `num` is still the element at index `i` of `ar`, which is the third element of `ar` since `i` is 4.
