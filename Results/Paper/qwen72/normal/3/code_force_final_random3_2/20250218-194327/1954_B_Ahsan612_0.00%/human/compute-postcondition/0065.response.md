The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3 or 5, and `ar` is a list with at least 4 elements.

- If `i` is 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.
- If `i` is 5, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

Since `ar` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` can be 5, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 5 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), `same` is 3 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `i` is 5, and `num` is the element at index `i-1` of `ar`. `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`. `len(ar)` must be greater than 5.**
