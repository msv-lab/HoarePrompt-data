The variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 4`, which is still greater than or equal to 0, given that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length n where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is n - 4**
