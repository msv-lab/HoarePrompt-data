Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length n where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is n - 4.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` updates the value of `ans[i]` to be the difference between `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000, except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. After the code execution, `ans[i]` is updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
