The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer. The length of `arr` is `n - 1`, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and 500. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where the elements from index 0 to index `n-2` are the differences between consecutive elements of `ans` and the corresponding elements of `arr`. The last element of `ans` remains undefined.
