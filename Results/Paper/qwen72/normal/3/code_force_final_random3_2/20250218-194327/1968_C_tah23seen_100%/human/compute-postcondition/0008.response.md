The variables in the loop head are `i`, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 5`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `n - 6` (since `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration).

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length n where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i], `i` is n - 6`**
