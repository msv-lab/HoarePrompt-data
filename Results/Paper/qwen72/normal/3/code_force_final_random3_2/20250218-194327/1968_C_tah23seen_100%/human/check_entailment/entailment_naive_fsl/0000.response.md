Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the value of `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` could result in a non-positive number, which would violate the condition that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\). For example, if the input array is `[1, 1]` (i.e., \(x_2 = 1\), \(x_3 = 1\)), the program will generate an array `ans` where `ans[1] = 10^9` and `ans[2] = 10^9 - 1 = 999999999`. However, when it tries to compute `ans[0]`, it will set `ans[0] = 999999999 - 1 = 999999998`, which is valid. But if the input array is `[1, 10^9]`, the program will generate `ans[1] = 10^9` and `ans[2] = 10^9 - 10^9 = 0`, which is not valid since \(a_i\) must be at least 1.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the values of `ans[i]` are always positive and within the specified range.
