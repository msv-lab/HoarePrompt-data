Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`, and the last element of `arr` has been appended to `new_arr`.**
