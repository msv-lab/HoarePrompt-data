The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in the specified pattern, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`**
