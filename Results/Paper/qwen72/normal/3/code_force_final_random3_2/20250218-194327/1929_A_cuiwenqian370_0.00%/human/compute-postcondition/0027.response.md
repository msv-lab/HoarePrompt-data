Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a pattern where the last element is appended first, followed by the first element, then the second-to-last element, followed by the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended last.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `left` will be equal to `n`, and `right` will be `-1`. The list `new_arr` will contain all the elements from `arr` in a specific order: starting from the last element and the first element, then the second-to-last element and the second element, and so on. If the length of `arr` (i.e., `n`) is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be the last element appended to `new_arr`.
