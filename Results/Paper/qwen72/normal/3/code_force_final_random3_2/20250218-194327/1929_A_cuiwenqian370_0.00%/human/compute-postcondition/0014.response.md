Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr`, the last element of `arr`, and `arr[left]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `new_arr` contains either the first element of `arr` if `left` is equal to `right`, or the first and last elements of `arr` if `left` is not equal to `right`.
- The code snippet `new_arr.append(arr[left])` adds the element at index `left` of `arr` to `new_arr`.
- Since `left` is 1, the element at index 1 of `arr` is added to `new_arr`.
- Therefore, `new_arr` now contains the first element of `arr`, the last element of `arr`, and the element at index 1 of `arr`.
