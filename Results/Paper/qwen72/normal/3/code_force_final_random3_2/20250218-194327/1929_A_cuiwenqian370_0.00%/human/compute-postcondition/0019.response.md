Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr`, the last element of `arr`, and the element at index `left` (which is the same as the second element of `arr`). Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and the second element of `arr`.**
