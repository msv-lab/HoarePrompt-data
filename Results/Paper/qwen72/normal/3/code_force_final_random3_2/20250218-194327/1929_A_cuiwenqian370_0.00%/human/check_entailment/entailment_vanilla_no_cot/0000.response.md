Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of the array. The program sorts the array and then rearranges it by alternating elements from the ends of the sorted array to the middle. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The correct approach is to sort the array and then place the largest and smallest elements alternately, starting with the largest element. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum beauty.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += (new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

However, the original program calculates the beauty using the absolute differences, which is not necessary according to the problem statement. The problem specifies that the beauty is the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \), not the absolute values. Therefore, the corrected program should not use `abs`:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += (new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected approach will ensure that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly.
