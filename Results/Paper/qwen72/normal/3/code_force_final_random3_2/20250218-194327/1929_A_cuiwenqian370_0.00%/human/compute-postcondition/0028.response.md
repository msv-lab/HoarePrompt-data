Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a pattern where the last element is appended first, followed by the first element, then the second-to-last element, followed by the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended last, `max_beauty` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of a new variable `max_beauty`, which is set to 0. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `left`, `right`, `new_arr`) retain their original values and properties.
