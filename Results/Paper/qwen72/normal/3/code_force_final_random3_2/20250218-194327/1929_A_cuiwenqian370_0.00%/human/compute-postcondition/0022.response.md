The code snippet `new_arr.append(arr[right])` appends the value of `arr[right]` to the list `new_arr`. Given the initial state, `right` is `n - 3`, so the value `arr[n - 3]` is appended to `new_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`, `new_arr` contains the value `arr[n - 3]`.**
