The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 2 and `right` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must still be less than or equal to `right`. Since `left` is 2 and `right` is `n - 3`, `right` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. This means `n - 3` must be greater than or equal to 2, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to `left` or `right` if `n` is at least 5. If `n` is less than 5, the loop would not execute again, but since the initial state specifies that `2 <= n <= 100`, we can assume `n` is at least 5 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`**
