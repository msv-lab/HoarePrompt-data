Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 2 + 1 // (k - 1), `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- `z` is initially set to `1 + 1 // (k - 1)`.
- The code snippet `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- Since `z` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1)`, `z // (k - 1)` will be `1 // (k - 1)`, which is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `k`.
- Therefore, `z` becomes `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `2 + 1 // (k - 1)`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
