Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block where `x > k - 1` is incorrect. The loop that calculates `z` does not correctly simulate the process of placing bets and accumulating coins in a way that guarantees Sasha can achieve any number of coins.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3 4 10
```
According to the problem description, Sasha can place bets such that he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. However, the program will output "NO" for this case, which is incorrect.

The logic in the `else` block should be re-evaluated to correctly simulate the betting strategy. The current implementation of the loop does not accurately reflect the rules of the casino and the promotion, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
