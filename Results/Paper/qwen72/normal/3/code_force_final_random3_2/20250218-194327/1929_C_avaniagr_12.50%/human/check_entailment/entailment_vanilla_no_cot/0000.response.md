Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins. Here's an analysis of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `x < k - 1` Case**:
   - The program checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints 'YES' if true. This is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that Sasha can place bets in such a way that he can recover from losses and still achieve any number of coins. For example, if `k = 2` and `x = 1`, Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin, and if he loses, he can place a bet of 2 coins next time. This strategy ensures he can always recover and achieve any number of coins.

2. **Incorrect Logic for `x == k - 1` Case**:
   - The program checks if `a >= x + 3` and prints 'YES' if true. This is also incorrect. The condition `a >= x + 3` is not the correct criterion to determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins. The correct condition should be based on the fact that Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin and recover from losses.

3. **Incorrect Logic for `x > k - 1` Case**:
   - The program uses a loop to calculate `z` and then checks if `a >= z`. The loop logic is flawed and does not correctly simulate the process of placing bets and recovering from losses. The correct approach should involve a different strategy to ensure that Sasha can always recover and achieve any number of coins.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins, we need to consider the following:

- If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin and recover from losses. He can place a bet of 1 coin, and if he loses, he can place a bet of 2 coins, and so on. This strategy ensures that he can always recover and achieve any number of coins.
- If `x >= k - 1`, Sasha can place a bet of 1 coin and recover from losses. The key is to ensure that he has enough coins to place the next bet after a series of losses.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee any number of coins
            min_coins_needed = 1
            for i in range(x + 1):
                min_coins_needed = (min_coins_needed - 1) * k + 1
            if a >= min_coins_needed:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation:

- For `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin and recover from losses, so the answer is always 'YES'.
- For `x >= k - 1`, we need to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee that he can always recover from any series of losses. This is done by simulating the process of placing bets and recovering from losses. The formula `(min_coins_needed - 1) * k + 1` ensures that after each series of losses, Sasha can place a bet that will recover his losses and still have enough coins to continue.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for all test cases.
