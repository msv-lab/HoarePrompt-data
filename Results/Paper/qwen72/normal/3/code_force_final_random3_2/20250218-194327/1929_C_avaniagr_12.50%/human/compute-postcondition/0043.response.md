The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be at least 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.
- `x` must still be at least 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 1, `i` is 1**
