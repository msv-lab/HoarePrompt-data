Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `z` is the sum of 1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1 repeated `x + 1` times, `i` is `x`, and `a` is less than `z`.**
