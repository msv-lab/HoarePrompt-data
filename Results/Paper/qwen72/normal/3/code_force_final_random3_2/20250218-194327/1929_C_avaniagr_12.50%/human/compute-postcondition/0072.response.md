Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
   - `z` is the sum of the expression \(1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1\) repeated `x + 1` times.
   - `i` is `x`.
   - The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

2. **Expression for `z`:**
   - The expression \(1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1\) is evaluated and repeated `x + 1` times.
   - Let's break down the expression:
     - \(1 // (k - 1)\) is the integer division of 1 by \(k - 1\). This will be 0 if \(k > 1\) and will raise a ZeroDivisionError if \(k = 1\).
     - \(1 + 0 + (1 + 0) // (k - 1) + 1\) simplifies to \(1 + 0 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1\).
     - If \(k > 1\), \(1 // (k - 1)\) is 0, so the expression further simplifies to \(1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2\).
     - If \(k = 1\), the expression will raise a ZeroDivisionError.

3. **Sum of the Expression:**
   - If \(k > 1\), the expression \(1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1\) evaluates to 2.
   - `z` is the sum of 2 repeated `x + 1` times, which is \(2 \times (x + 1)\).

4. **Condition for `a`:**
   - The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.
   - Since `z` is \(2 \times (x + 1)\), the condition is \(a \geq 2 \times (x + 1)\).

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('YES')`.
   - This statement will always print 'YES' if the conditions described in the initial state are met.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will execute and print 'YES' because the conditions are explicitly stated to be true.

Output: **YES**
