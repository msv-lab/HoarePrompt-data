The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the expression `x + 1`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `x + 1` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `x + 1` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1), `i` is 2**
