Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
3. `l` and `r` are updated with new integers provided by the user input.
4. `tc` is greater than 5.
5. `ppp` is 23.
6. `s` is less than or equal to the new `l`.
7. `e` is greater than or equal to the new `r`.
8. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(new l, 0, 0)`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input for `l` and `r`**:
   - The user provides two integers, `l` and `r`, both of which must be greater than 2.
   - Let's denote these new values as `new_l` and `new_r`.

2. **Determine `eli`**:
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(new_l, 0, 0)`.
   - This means `eli` is the smallest index such that `arr[eli] >= (new_l, 0, 0)`.

3. **Determine `min(eli, LA)`**:
   - `LA` is not explicitly defined, but it is likely the length of `arr` minus one (i.e., the last index of `arr`).
   - `min(eli, LA)` will be the smaller of `eli` and `LA`.

4. **Extract `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - Let's denote this tuple as `arr[min(eli, LA)] = (s, e, some_value)`.

5. **Conditions on `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is less than or equal to `new_l`.
   - `e` is greater than or equal to `new_r`.

6. **Print Statement**:
   - The code will print `s` and `e + 1`.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions and the structure of the problem, the output will be:
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and it is less than or equal to `new_l`.
- `e + 1` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` plus 1, and `e` is greater than or equal to `new_r`.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr and is less than or equal to new_l, and e is the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr and is greater than or equal to new_r)**
