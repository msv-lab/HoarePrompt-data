Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds without any changes to `ppp`. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. Additionally, `s` is less than or equal to `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. If `e` is less than `r`, then `e` is less than `r`. If `e` is less than `N`, the current value of `e` remains less than `N`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, the value of `e` remains greater than or equal to `N`.***
