Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds without any changes to `ppp`. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.**
