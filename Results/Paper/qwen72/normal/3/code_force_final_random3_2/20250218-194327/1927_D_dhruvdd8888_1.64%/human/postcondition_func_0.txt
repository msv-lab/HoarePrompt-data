The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `nums` from the standard input. It then processes the list to identify contiguous segments of the same value and stores these segments in a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the segment. The function appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases. It then reads an integer `q` indicating the number of queries, and for each query, it reads two integers `l` and `r` representing a range of indices in `nums`. For each query, the function checks if the range intersects with any of the identified segments and prints the indices of the segment boundaries that are closest to but outside the query range. If the query range does not intersect with any valid segment, it prints `-1, -1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.
