Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`, and the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`.**

The value of `s` is now 0, which is the same as the initial value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
