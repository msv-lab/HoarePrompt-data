Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
3. `l` and `r` are updated with new integers provided by the user input.
4. `tc` is greater than 5.
5. `ppp` is 23.
6. `s` is less than or equal to the new `l`.
7. `e` is greater than or equal to the new `r`.
8. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(new l, 0, 0)`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input for `l` and `r`:**
   - The user provides two integers, `l` and `r`, both of which must be greater than 2.
   - Let's denote the new values of `l` and `r` as `new_l` and `new_r` respectively.

2. **Determine `eli`:**
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(new_l, 0, 0)`.
   - This means `eli` is the smallest index such that `arr[eli] >= (new_l, 0, 0)`.

3. **Determine `s` and `e`:**
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `LA` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a valid index in `arr`.
   - `min(eli, LA)` ensures that the index used is the smaller of `eli` and `LA`.

4. **Conditions on `s` and `e`:**
   - `s` is less than or equal to `new_l`.
   - `e` is greater than or equal to `new_r`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The code prints `s - 1` and `s`.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions, `s` is a value that is less than or equal to `new_l`. Therefore, `s - 1` will be one less than `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and s is less than or equal to the new l)**
