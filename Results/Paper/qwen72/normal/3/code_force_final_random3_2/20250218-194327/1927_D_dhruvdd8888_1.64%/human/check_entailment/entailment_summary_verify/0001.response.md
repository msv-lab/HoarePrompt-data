### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the end of the array.

3. **Building the `arr` List:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and groups consecutive equal elements into tuples `(start, end, value)`.
   - Each tuple in `arr` represents a segment of the array where all elements are equal.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently identifies the segments.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - The logic for determining the indices of different elements is flawed:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous segment and the first element of the current segment. This is incorrect because it assumes the previous segment exists and is valid, which may not always be the case.
     - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` because the segment covers the entire range and all elements are the same. This is correct.
     - If the end of the segment is less than `N`, it prints the indices of the first element of the current segment and the first element of the next segment. This is incorrect because it assumes the next segment exists and is valid, which may not always be the case.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of different elements within the same segment or in adjacent segments.

5. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program includes a special case for `ppp == 23` where it prints the array `nums` and the query `(l, r)` if `tc > 5`. This is likely for debugging purposes and does not affect the correctness of the solution. However, it can be removed for clarity.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle all query cases, especially when the segment boundaries are not straightforward.
- The logic for determining the indices of different elements is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs in many scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical errors in the query handling section and does not correctly identify pairs of different elements in all cases. The special case handling for `ppp == 23` is not relevant to the problem and can be removed.

Final: **False**
