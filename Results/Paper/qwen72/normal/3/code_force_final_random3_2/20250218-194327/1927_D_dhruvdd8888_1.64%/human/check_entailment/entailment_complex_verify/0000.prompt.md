You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: The loop has executed `int(input())` times. For each iteration, `l` and `r` were updated with new integers provided by the user input. If `tc` was greater than 5, the loop printed `l` and `r` for each iteration where `ppp` was 23 and continued to the next iteration. Otherwise, `s` and `e` were assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. If `s` was greater than `l`, the loop printed `s - 1` and `s` unless `s` was 1, in which case it printed `-1, -1`. If `e` was greater than or equal to `r`, the loop printed `-1, -1`. If `e` was less than `r` and `e` was less than `N`, the loop printed `s` and `e + 1`. If `e` was greater than or equal to `N`, the loop printed `-1, -1`. The values of `N`, `nums`, `arr`, `LA`, and `ppp` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `nums` from the standard input. It then processes the list to identify contiguous segments of the same value and stores these segments in a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the segment. The function appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases. It then reads an integer `q` indicating the number of queries, and for each query, it reads two integers `l` and `r` representing a range of indices in `nums`. For each query, the function checks if the range intersects with any of the identified segments and prints the indices of the segment boundaries that are closest to but outside the query range. If the query range does not intersect with any valid segment, it prints `-1, -1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle queries correctly in all cases. Specifically, the logic for finding a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\) within the given range \([l, r]\) is flawed. The program uses a precomputed list `arr` to store ranges of consecutive equal elements, and then tries to find a pair of indices based on these ranges. However, this approach fails to correctly handle cases where the range \([l, r]\) spans multiple ranges of equal elements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The program will output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

The program fails to correctly handle the query \((1, 5)\) because it only checks the first and last elements of the range, which may not be the correct approach if the range spans multiple segments of equal elements. In this case, the correct pair \((2, 3)\) is found, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all potential cases.

A more robust approach would involve checking all elements within the range \([l, r]\) to find a pair of different elements, or confirming that no such pair exists.
