Postcondition: **`s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are updated with new integers provided by the user input, `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is 23, `s` is less than or equal to the new `l`, `e` is greater than or equal to the new `r`, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(new l, 0, 0)`. If `s` is 1, the conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions and variable values also remain unchanged.**
