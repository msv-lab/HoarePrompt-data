Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. If `ppp` is 23, `s` retains its value or is set to 1, and `s` remains less than or equal to `l`. `e` remains greater than or equal to `r` and `e` remains less than `N` or greater than or equal to `N`.***
