Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in Main Loop**:
   - The main loop for processing test cases calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments. The function `func_1()` is defined to read input directly, which is not a good practice and can lead to issues in the program flow.

2. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads input using `sys.stdin.readline` but does not handle the input correctly. It should read the number of queries and process each query accordingly.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Pairs**:
   - The logic for finding pairs of indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the range `[l, r]` is flawed. The program uses a list `arr` to store ranges of consecutive equal elements, but it does not correctly handle the case where the range `[l, r]` spans multiple ranges of different elements.

4. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**:
   - The `bisect_left` function is used to find the starting index of the range, but the program does not correctly handle the case where the range `[l, r]` contains multiple different elements. The logic to determine if a pair exists is incorrect and does not cover all possible scenarios.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array has all unique elements or all elements are the same within the query range.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you can use a more straightforward approach:
- For each query, iterate through the range `[l, r]` and find the first pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j`.
- If no such pair is found, output `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_different_pair(nums, l, r):
    for i in range(l, r):
        if nums[i] != nums[i + 1]:
            return i + 1, i + 2
    return -1, -1

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        i, j = find_different_pair(nums, l - 1, r - 1)
        print(i, j)
```

This program correctly processes each test case and each query, and it finds the required pair of indices or reports that no such pair exists.
