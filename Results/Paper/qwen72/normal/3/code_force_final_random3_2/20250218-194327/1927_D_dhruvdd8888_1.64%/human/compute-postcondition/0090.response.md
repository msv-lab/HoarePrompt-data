Output State: **The loop has executed `int(input())` times. For each iteration, `l` and `r` were updated with new integers provided by the user input. If `tc` was greater than 5, the loop printed `l` and `r` for each iteration where `ppp` was 23 and continued to the next iteration. Otherwise, `s` and `e` were assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. If `s` was greater than `l`, the loop printed `s - 1` and `s` unless `s` was 1, in which case it printed `-1, -1`. If `e` was greater than or equal to `r`, the loop printed `-1, -1`. If `e` was less than `r` and `e` was less than `N`, the loop printed `s` and `e + 1`. If `e` was greater than or equal to `N`, the loop printed `-1, -1`. The values of `N`, `nums`, `arr`, `LA`, and `ppp` remain unchanged.**
