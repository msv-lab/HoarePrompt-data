Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
3. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
4. `tc` is greater than 5.
5. `ppp` is set to 23.
6. `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`.
7. `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains greater than or equal to `r` and less than `N` or greater than or equal to `N`.
8. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, `ppp`, or `eli`.

### Explanation:
- The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
- No variables or conditions from the initial state affect the output of this `print` statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
