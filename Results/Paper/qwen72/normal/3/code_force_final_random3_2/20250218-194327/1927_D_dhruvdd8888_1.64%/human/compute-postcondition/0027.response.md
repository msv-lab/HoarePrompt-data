Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline`. This means `N` is an integer input by the user.
2. `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended. This means `nums` is a list that contains some integers, and the last element of this list is `-1`.
3. `s` is `N`. This means `s` is equal to the integer value `N`.
4. `e` is 0. This means `e` is initialized to 0.
5. `num` is `-1`. This means `num` is initialized to -1.
6. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of `nums` that had the same value, and the value itself. This means `arr` contains tuples that describe segments of `nums` with the same value.
7. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. This means `LA` is the index of the last tuple in the list `arr`.
8. `ppp` is 23. This means `ppp` is initialized to 23.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums`.
- According to the initial state, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended to it.

### Output:
Since `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, the output will be the list `nums` as it is described in the initial state.

Output: **[list of integers, -1] (where the list of integers is the initial content of `nums` before appending -1)**

For example, if the initial content of `nums` was `[1, 2, 3]`, the output would be:
Output: **[1, 2, 3, -1]**
