### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Querying for Maximum Value**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It initializes `maxi` to 0, which will hold the index of the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` and asks queries of the form `"? maxi maxi i i"`.
   - The response to these queries helps in determining if `p_i` is greater than `p_maxi` in terms of the bitwise OR operation. If `p_i` is greater, `maxi` is updated to `i`.

2. **Finding Indices with Maximum XOR**:
   - The program initializes `arr` with the index 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` and asks queries of the form `"? maxi arr[0] maxi i"`.
   - The response to these queries helps in determining if `p_i` is equal to `p_maxi` in terms of the bitwise OR operation. If `p_i` is equal, `i` is added to `arr`.
   - If `p_i` is less than `p_maxi`, `arr` is reset to `[i]`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Value in the Candidate List**:
   - The program initializes `mini` to the first element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements in `arr` and asks queries of the form `"? mini mini item item"`.
   - The response to these queries helps in determining if `p_item` is less than `p_mini` in terms of the bitwise OR operation. If `p_item` is less, `mini` is updated to `item`.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the pair that maximizes the XOR value.

### Analysis:

- **Query Efficiency**:
  - The program uses at most `3n` queries:
    - `n-1` queries to find the maximum value.
    - `n-1` queries to find indices with the same maximum value.
    - `n-1` queries to find the minimum value among the candidates.
  - This is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation by comparing `p_maxi` with `p_i` using the bitwise OR operation.
  - It then finds all indices that have the same maximum value.
  - Finally, it finds the minimum value among these candidates to ensure that the XOR value is maximized.
  - The logic ensures that the XOR value between `maxi` and `mini` is indeed the maximum possible.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and uses the allowed number of queries efficiently. Therefore, it should correctly find a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value.

Correctness: **True**
