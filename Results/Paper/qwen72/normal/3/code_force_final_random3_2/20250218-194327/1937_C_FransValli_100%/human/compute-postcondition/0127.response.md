Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `arr` must have at least four elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the third element of `arr`.***
