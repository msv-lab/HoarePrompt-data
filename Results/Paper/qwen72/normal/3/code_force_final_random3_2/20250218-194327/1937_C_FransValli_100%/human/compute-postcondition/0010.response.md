Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is updated to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The `print` statement will print a string starting with `?`.
   - The next two values are `maxi`. Based on the initial state, `maxi` is 0 unless `res` is '<', in which case `maxi` is updated to 1.
   - The next two values are `i`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 2.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` remains 0.
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is updated to 1.

5. **Output Based on Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is not '<':
     - The `print` statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`.
   - If `res` is '<':
     - The `print` statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `res`, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the problem does not require us to handle both scenarios separately; we can provide the most precise description based on the given information.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where [maxi] is 0 if `res` is not '<', and 1 if `res` is '<')**
