Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `arr` must have at least two elements.
   - `item` is the second element of `arr`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will output a string that starts with a question mark `?`.
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr`. Since `arr` has at least two elements, `mini` is a known value.
   - `item` is the second element of `arr`. Since `arr` has at least two elements, `item` is also a known value.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console without any buffering.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string that includes the question mark `?`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and then the value of `item` twice.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of `arr` and [item] is the second element of `arr`)**
