Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is [3].**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` is now [3]. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition for `res` (whether it is '<', '=', or something else) does not affect the execution of this code snippet, so the state of `res` remains as the new input string.
