Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr`, `arr` is a list that contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', and `item` is the last element of `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`, and `res` is an input string with the current value being '>' if the condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, and `res` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `arr` must have at least four elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the third element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
