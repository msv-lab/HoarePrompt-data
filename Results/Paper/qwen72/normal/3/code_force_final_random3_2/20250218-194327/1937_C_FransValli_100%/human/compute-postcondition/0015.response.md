Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element in the print statement is a string literal `'?'`.
   - The second and third elements are the value of `maxi`. Based on the initial state, `maxi` can be either 2 (if `res` is '<') or 0 (if `res` is not '<').
   - The fourth and fifth elements are the value of `i`, which is explicitly given as 3.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0.
   - The print statement will always include the string literal `'?'` followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and the value of `i` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:

- If `res` is '<':
  Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
- If `res` is not '<':
  Output: **? 0 0 3 3**

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `res`, we need to consider both cases. However, the format requires a single output, so we will provide the most precise description possible:

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3 (where [maxi] is 2 if res is '<' and 0 otherwise)**
