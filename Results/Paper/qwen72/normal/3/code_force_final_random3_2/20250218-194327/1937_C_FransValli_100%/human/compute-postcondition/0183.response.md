The only objects in the loop head are `item` and `arr`. The loop iterates over the elements of `arr` starting from the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least three elements, and `item` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` must have at least three elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is `>`, `mini` is set to the second element of `arr`.**
