Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', and `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.**

The value of `maxi` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `n` being an input integer greater than 0, `i` being `n-1`, `mini` being the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` containing the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', and `item` being the last element of `arr` that was processed, all remain valid.
