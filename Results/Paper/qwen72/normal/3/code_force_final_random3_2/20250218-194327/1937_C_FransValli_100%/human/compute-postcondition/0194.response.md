To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`maxi`**: This variable is mentioned but not explicitly defined in the initial state. We can assume it has some value, but it is not specified.
2. **`mini`**: According to the initial state, `mini` will be the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or it will retain its initial value if no such element exists. The initial value of `mini` is not specified, so we need to consider both scenarios.
3. **`arr`**: The list `arr` is mentioned but its contents are not explicitly defined. We know it remains unchanged.
4. **`n`, `i`, `item`**: These variables are mentioned but their values are not specified in the initial state.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

- The string `'!'` will be printed as is.
- The value of `maxi` will be printed as it is, but since its value is not specified, we can only describe it generally.
- The value of `mini` will be printed based on the initial state description. If no element in `arr` resulted in `res` being '>', `mini` will retain its initial value. If such an element exists, `mini` will be that element.

Since the exact values of `maxi` and `mini` are not provided, we can only describe them in general terms based on the initial state.

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where [maxi] is the value of `maxi` and [mini] is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or it retains its initial value if no such element exists)**
