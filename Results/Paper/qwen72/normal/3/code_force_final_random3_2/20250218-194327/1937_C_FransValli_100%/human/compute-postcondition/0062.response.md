Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the second element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', or the third element of `arr` if `res` is '='. `res` is the new input value.***
