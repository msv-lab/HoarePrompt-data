The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.**
