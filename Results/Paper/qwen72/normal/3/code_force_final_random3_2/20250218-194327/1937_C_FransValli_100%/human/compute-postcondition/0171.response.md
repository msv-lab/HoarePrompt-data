Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is an input string, `arr` is now [3].**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` (which is 3) to `arr`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `item`, `res`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the new value of `arr` is `[3]`, and all other conditions from the initial state remain valid.
