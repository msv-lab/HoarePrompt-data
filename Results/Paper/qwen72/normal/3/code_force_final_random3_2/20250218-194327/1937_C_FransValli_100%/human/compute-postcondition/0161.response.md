The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', the values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `item` remain unchanged.**
