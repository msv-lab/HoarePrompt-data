Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `res` is a new input string.
  - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2].
  - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [1, 2].
  - Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`res` and `arr`**:
   - The value of `arr` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2].
   - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [1, 2].
   - If `res` is anything else, `arr` remains unchanged. However, since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `arr`, we assume it is an empty list or some other list that is not specified.

2. **`maxi`**:
   - The variable `maxi` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its value.

3. **`i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If `res` is '<'**:
  - `arr` will be [2].
  - The print statement will try to access `arr[0]`, which is 2.
  - Output: **? [maxi] 2 [maxi] 3**

- **If `res` is '='**:
  - `arr` will be [1, 2].
  - The print statement will try to access `arr[0]`, which is 1.
  - Output: **? [maxi] 1 [maxi] 3**

- **If `res` is anything else**:
  - `arr` remains unchanged.
  - If `arr` is empty, accessing `arr[0]` will raise an `IndexError`.
  - If `arr` is not empty, the value of `arr[0]` will be the first element of the unchanged `arr`.
  - Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3 (where [arr[0]] is the first element of the unchanged `arr` list)**

### Final Output:
Since `maxi` is not defined, we cannot provide its exact value. However, we can describe the output based on the value of `res`.

- **If `res` is '<'**:
  Output: **? [maxi] 2 [maxi] 3 (where [maxi] is the value of the undefined variable `maxi`)**

- **If `res` is '='**:
  Output: **? [maxi] 1 [maxi] 3 (where [maxi] is the value of the undefined variable `maxi`)**

- **If `res` is anything else**:
  Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3 (where [maxi] is the value of the undefined variable `maxi` and [arr[0]] is the first element of the unchanged `arr` list)**

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3 (where [maxi] is the value of the undefined variable `maxi` and [arr[0]] is the first element of the `arr` list based on the value of `res`)**
