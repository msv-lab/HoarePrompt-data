Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string.** 

The value of `res` is updated to the input string provided by the user. The values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged. If the input string is '<', `maxi` will be updated to 1 in a subsequent step, but this is not reflected in the current output state.
