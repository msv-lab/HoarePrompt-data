Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `1`, and `res` is '<'. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `1`, and `res` is '='. Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `0`, and `res` is not '<'.***
