Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `arr` is a list that contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', and `item` is the last element of `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterated over.
- `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
- `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
- `arr` is a list that contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'.
- `item` is the last element of `arr`, which is the last index that was added to `arr` during the loop execution.
