Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 2 if `res` was '<' before, otherwise `maxi` remains 0, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is a new input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to a new input string.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, `item`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `res` is not specified, so it is described as a new input string.
- The conditions for `maxi` and `mini` based on the previous value of `res` are still valid, but `res` itself has been updated.
