Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', `arr` is `[3]` and `item` is `2`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', `arr` is `[0]` or `[1]` or `[0, 1]` and `item` is `0` or `1`. If `res` is '=', `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` or `[0, 2]` or `[1, 2]` and `item` is `0` or `1`. `res` is the user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [i]` changes the value of `arr` to a list containing the value of `i`, which is 3.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 3.
- The values of `maxi` and `mini` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- The value of `res` remains the user input.
- The value of `item` remains the same as it was in the initial state, based on the value of `res`.
