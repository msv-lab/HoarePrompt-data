Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is [2].**

The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` (which is 2) to `arr`. The initial conditions for `n` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr` is now a list containing the single element 2, while `n` is still greater than 2 and `res` is still the new input string.
