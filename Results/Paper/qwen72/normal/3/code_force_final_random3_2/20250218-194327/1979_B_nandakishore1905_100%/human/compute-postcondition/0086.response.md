Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are the new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is odd, no changes are made to `k`. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in this binary representation, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). If `k` is a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in this binary representation, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).***
