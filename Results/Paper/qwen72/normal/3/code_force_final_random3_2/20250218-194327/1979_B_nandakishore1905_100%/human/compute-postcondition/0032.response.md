The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input integer that defines the range. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the input integer. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the input integer is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and the input integer must still be greater than 1.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the program retains the initial values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is odd, the program retains the initial values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the updated string `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1), `f` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `f` is a power of 2.**
