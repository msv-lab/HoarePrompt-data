Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is \(2\) raised to the power of \(p - 1\), `f` is `k - q`, `f` is the value of `k - q`, and `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
- The value of `f` is calculated as `k - q`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged.
