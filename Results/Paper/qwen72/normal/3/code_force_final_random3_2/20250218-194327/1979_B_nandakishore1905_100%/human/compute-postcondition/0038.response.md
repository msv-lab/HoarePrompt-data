Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.**
