Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers where both are greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - `k` is a power of 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
   - It is given that `k` is a power of 2. Powers of 2 are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `k` is a power of 2, the `print(k)` statement will output one of the values from the set of powers of 2.
   - The exact value of `k` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n` and `m`, but we know it will be a power of 2.

Therefore, the output will be a power of 2, which is one of the values in the set {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...}.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2 and k = |n - m|)**
