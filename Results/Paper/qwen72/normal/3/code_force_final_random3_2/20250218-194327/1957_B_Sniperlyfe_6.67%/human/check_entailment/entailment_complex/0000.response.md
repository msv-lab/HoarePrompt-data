Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Let's break down the logic of the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
   - This is a good starting point because we need to construct `n` integers.

2. **Setting Initial Values**:
   - For each element in `nums`, the value is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
   - This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. For example, if `k` is 10 (binary `1010`), `k.bit_length() - 1` is 3, and `(1 << 3) - 1` is 7 (binary `111`).
   - This ensures that each number in the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

3. **Subtracting from `k`**:
   - After setting each element in `nums`, `k` is decremented by the value of the element.
   - This is done to ensure that the sum of the elements in `nums` equals `k`.

4. **Adjusting the Last Element**:
   - After the loop, `k` might be negative or zero, but the program adds the remaining `k` to the last element of `nums`.
   - This step ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly `k`.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`, but it is not necessarily the correct value to use for each element in `nums`.
- If `k` is smaller than `n * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`, the program will set each element to a value that is too large, and `k` will become negative, which is not allowed.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the values assigned to `nums` do not exceed `k` and that the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly `k`. A better approach would be to set each element to the smallest possible value that still maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, and then adjust the last element to make the sum equal to `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1):
        nums[i] = 1  # Set each element to 1 to maximize the number of 1s in the OR
        k -= 1
    nums[-1] = k  # Set the last element to the remaining value of k
    return nums
```

This version ensures that:
- Each element in `nums` is set to 1, which maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
- The last element is adjusted to ensure the sum of the elements is exactly `k`.

Given the original program, the logic is flawed and will not always produce a valid sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
