Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `nums[2]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `k` is now `k - nums[2]`, `nums` remains unchanged otherwise.**

The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[2]` from it. The value of `nums[2]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The other variables and conditions remain the same.
