Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is now `k - n * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`, `nums` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, so the final value of `i` is `n-1` (since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- Each iteration, the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` is assigned to `nums[i]`, and `k` is decremented by this value. After `n` iterations, `k` is reduced by `n * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`.
- The list `nums` will have all `n` elements set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` after the loop completes.
