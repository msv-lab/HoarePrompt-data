Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` elements where `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` and `nums[1]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, the rest of the elements in `nums` are zeros, `k` is now `k - ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[i]` is updated to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`.
- Since `i` is 1, `nums[1]` is now `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`.
- The value of `k` remains `k - ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`, as specified in the initial state.
- The rest of the elements in `nums` remain zeros.
- The values of `n` and `i` are unchanged.
