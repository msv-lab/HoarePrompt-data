Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has finished executing all iterations. `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` and `y` are the smallest and second smallest unique integers from the list `inp` (or both are `n + 1` if no such integers exist), and `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to the initial `x`, `y` will be the smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` but less than or equal to the initial `y`, and `ans` will be the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
