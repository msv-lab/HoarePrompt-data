Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. The loop will execute again if the new integer input is greater than the current iteration count.**
