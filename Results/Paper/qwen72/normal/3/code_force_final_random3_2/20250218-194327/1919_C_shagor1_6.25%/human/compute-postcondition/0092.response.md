The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `inp`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged based on the conditions described in the initial state.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `y` is equal to `a`, if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a`. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is now `ans + 1`.**
