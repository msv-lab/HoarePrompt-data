Postcondition: **`_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is the first element in `inp`, `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y` (where `a` is the first element in `inp` and is greater than `x`), otherwise `ans` is 1 and `a` is greater than `n + 1`. The expression `x == y` evaluates to `False` if `ans` is 1.**
