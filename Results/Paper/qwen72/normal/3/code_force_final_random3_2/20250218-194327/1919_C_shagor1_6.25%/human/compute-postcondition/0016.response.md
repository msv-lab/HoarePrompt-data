Postcondition: **`_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a` is less than or equal to `x` (which is `n + 1`), `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `x` (which is `n + 1`), `y` is set to `a` and `x == y` evaluates to `False` if `ans` is 1.**
