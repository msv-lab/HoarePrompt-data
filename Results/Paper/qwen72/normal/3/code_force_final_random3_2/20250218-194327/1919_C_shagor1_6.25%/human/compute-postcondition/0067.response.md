Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, and `a` is the third element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is set to 2. In both cases, `x` and `y` are not equal if `a` is greater than `n + 1`.***
