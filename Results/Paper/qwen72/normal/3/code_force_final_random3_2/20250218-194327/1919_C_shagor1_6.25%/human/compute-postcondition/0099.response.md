Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `y` is set to `a`, `x` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is set to `a`.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged.
- The list `inp` and the value of `a` (which is the third element of `inp`) are still valid as per the initial state.
