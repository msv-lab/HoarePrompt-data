Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is 1, `k` is -2 or -1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * -1 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`.**

Explanation:
- `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`, `k`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions for `t`, `n`, `s`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`, `k`, `bm`, and `sm` are still valid.
