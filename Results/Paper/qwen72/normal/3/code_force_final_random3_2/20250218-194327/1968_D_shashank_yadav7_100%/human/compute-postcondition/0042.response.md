Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the initial input integer minus `n`, `b` is the final value of `p[b] - 1` after `n` iterations, `s` is the final value of `p[s] - 1` after `n` iterations, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the sum of the initial value at index `s` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[s] - 1` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value at index `b` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[b] - 1` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- The loop index `i` will be `n - 1` after all iterations.
- The integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The integer `k` will be the initial input integer minus `n` (the number of iterations).
- The variables `b` and `s` will be the final values of `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` after `n` iterations, respectively.
- The list `p` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
- The variable `sp` will be the sum of the initial value at index `s` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[s] - 1` for each iteration.
- The variable `bp` will be the sum of the initial value at index `b` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[b] - 1` for each iteration.
- The variable `bm` will be the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration.
- The variable `sm` will be the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration.
