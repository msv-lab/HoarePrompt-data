Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is -1 if the loop executed fully or 0 if the loop was broken, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is now `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is the value of `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `i` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bp` is updated to `a[b] + a[b]`, which is `2 * a[b]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bm`, `sm`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `bp`.
- The conditions for `k` being 0 and breaking out of the loop or if statement are still valid.
