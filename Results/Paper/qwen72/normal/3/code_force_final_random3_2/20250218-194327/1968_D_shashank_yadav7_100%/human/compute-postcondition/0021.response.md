The value of `bp` is updated by adding the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` to its current value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `p` minus 1, `s` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `p` minus 1, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp`.**
