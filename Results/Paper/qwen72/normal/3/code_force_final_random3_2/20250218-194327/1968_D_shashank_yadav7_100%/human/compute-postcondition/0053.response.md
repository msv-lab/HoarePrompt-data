Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the sum of the initial value at index `s` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[s] - 1` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value at index `b` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[b] - 1` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, and `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` respectively.
- The initial state variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are now updated to the input integers provided by the user.
