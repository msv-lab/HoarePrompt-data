Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`.**

The code snippet `sm = a[s] * k` updates the value of `sm` to be the product of the value at index `s` in the list `a` and the integer `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
