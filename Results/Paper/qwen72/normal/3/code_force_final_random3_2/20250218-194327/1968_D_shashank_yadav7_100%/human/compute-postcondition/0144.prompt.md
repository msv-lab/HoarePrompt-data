Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `k` was greater than 0 initially and the loop executed fully, otherwise `i` is the value at the time `k` became 0 plus 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop executed fully or the value at the time `k` became 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, minus 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value of `a[s]`, `bp` is the value of `a[b]`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * k`, `n` is updated to an input integer, `k` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer minus 1, `s` is updated to an input integer minus 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is -1 if the loop executed fully or 0 if the loop was broken, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is now `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is the value of `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `i` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is 1, `k` is -2 or -1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is 2, `k` is -3, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
