The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the number of test cases, an integer. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be 0.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
