### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indices.
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns.
   - It iterates `k` times, updating the positions `b` and `s` based on the permutation `p`.
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are updated by adding the corresponding values from `a` at the current positions.
   - The maximum scores `bm` and `sm` are updated using the formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` respectively.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the function compares the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` and prints the result accordingly:
     - "Bodya" if `bm > sm`
     - "Sasha" if `bm < sm`
     - "Draw" if `bm == sm`

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
  - The formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` is used to update `bm` and `sm`, but this is incorrect. The score should be accumulated over the `k` turns, not recalculated using the remaining `k` value.
  - The correct approach would be to accumulate the scores directly over the `k` turns.

- **Loop Iteration**:
  - The loop iterates `k` times, but the `k` value is decremented inside the loop. This is unnecessary and can be simplified by just iterating `k` times.

### Corrected Approach:
- The loop should iterate `k` times, updating the positions and scores directly.
- The final scores should be compared at the end of the loop.

### Correctness:
- The program as written does not correctly calculate the scores for each player over the `k` turns.
- The logic for updating the maximum scores is flawed and does not match the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
