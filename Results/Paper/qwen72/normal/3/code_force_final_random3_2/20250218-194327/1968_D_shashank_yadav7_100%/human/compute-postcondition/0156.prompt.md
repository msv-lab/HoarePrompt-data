You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined structure, not as direct function parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), the second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and the third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations for all test cases. `t` is 0, indicating no more test cases to process. `i` is the total number of test cases processed, which is the initial value of `t`. `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the final values after the last test case has been processed, which could be 0 or some other value depending on the input. `p` and `a` are lists that have been processed and are in their final state after the last test case. `sp` and `bp` are the sums of the values from the `a` list at the indices `s` and `b` respectively, accumulated over all iterations of the last test case. `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values of the expressions `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` respectively, computed over all iterations of the last test case. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the program has printed 'Bodya' for the last test case. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the program has printed 'Sasha' for the last test case. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the program has printed 'Draw' for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no direct parameters but reads multiple test cases from standard input or a predefined structure. Each test case consists of: the first line containing four integers n, k, P_B, P_S (where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), the second line containing n integers p_1, ..., p_n (where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and the third line containing n integers a_1, ..., a_n (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
