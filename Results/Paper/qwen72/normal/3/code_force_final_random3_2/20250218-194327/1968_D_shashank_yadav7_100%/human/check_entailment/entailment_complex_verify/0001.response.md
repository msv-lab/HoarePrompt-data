### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` and adjusts them to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes the scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) based on their starting positions.
   - It also initializes the maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) based on their starting positions and the number of turns `k`.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for up to `n` iterations, decrementing `k` on each iteration.
   - It updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by adding the corresponding values from array `a`.
   - It also updates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the current score plus the remaining turns multiplied by the current position's value in `a`.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - After the simulation, the program compares the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Update of Maximum Scores:**
  - The program incorrectly updates the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) by using the formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`. This formula does not correctly account for the dynamic changes in the scores and positions over multiple turns.
  - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for exactly `k` turns and keep track of the actual scores, not the maximum possible scores.

- **Incorrect Loop Termination:**
  - The loop terminates when `k` reaches 0, but it should run for exactly `k` turns. The loop should be controlled by the number of turns, not by decrementing `k` within the loop.
  - The loop should be `for _ in range(k):` to ensure it runs for exactly `k` turns.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **Initialization:**
  - `b -= 1` and `s -= 1` correctly adjust the starting positions to be zero-indexed.
  - `sp = a[s]` and `bp = a[b]` correctly initialize the scores based on the starting positions.
  - `bm = a[b] * k` and `sm = a[s] * k` incorrectly initialize the maximum possible scores. These should be initialized to 0.

- **Game Simulation:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n):` is incorrect. It should be `for _ in range(k):` to ensure it runs for exactly `k` turns.
  - The loop correctly updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p`.
  - The loop incorrectly updates the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`). It should only update the actual scores (`bp` and `sp`).

- **Final Comparison:**
  - The final comparison should be based on the actual scores (`bp` and `sp`), not the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`).

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the way it updates the maximum possible scores and terminates the loop.
- The corrected program correctly simulates the game for `k` turns and compares the actual scores of Bodya and Sasha.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
