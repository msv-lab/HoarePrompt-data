Postcondition: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, `k` is updated to -1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * -1 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, `k` remains -2 or -1, and no changes are made to `bm` or `sm`.**
