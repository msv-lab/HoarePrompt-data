Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `p` minus 1, `s` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `p` minus 1, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` value and the value of `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` value and the value of `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`.** 

The value of `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the value of `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
