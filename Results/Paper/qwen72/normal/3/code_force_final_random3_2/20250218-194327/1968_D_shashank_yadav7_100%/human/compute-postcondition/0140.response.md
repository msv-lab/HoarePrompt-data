Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is 2, `k` is -3, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`.
- The previous values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`, `k`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `bm` is calculated as `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, where `k` is -3 and `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`.
- Therefore, `bm` is now the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (-3) + (a[b] + a[b] + a[b])`, which simplifies to `max(bm, -3 * a[b] + 3 * a[b])` or `max(bm, 0)`.
