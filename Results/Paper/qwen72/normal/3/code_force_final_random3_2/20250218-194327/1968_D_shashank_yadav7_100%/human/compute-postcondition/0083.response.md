The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at some value, and `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged; `s` is now `p[s] - 1`; `bm` is now `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is now `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)` if `k` is not 0, otherwise all variables remain unchanged and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `bp` is now `bp + a[b]`; `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
