Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they appear in `qs`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `p` to a list of integers provided by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, which is now updated to the new list of integers.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, `res`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The loop condition for `_` being less than `t` remains valid.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions, with the only change being the updated value of `p`.
