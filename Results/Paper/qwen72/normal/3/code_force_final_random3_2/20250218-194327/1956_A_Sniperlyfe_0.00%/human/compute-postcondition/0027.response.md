The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the next element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the second element in `qs`, and `qs` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 3 elements, and `n` will be the third element in `qs`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q and must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `n` is the third element in `qs`.**
