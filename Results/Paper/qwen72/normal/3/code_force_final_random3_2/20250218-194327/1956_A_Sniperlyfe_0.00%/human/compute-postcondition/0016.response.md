The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop iterates `t` times, and at the end of the previous iteration, the loop counter `_` has been incremented. Since the loop is defined using `range(t)`, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, and `_` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, and `qs` has been updated to a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they appear in `qs`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again**.
