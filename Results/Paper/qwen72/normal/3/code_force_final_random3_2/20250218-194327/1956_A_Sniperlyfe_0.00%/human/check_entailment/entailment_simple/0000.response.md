### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - **Input**: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le p[i] \le 100\) and `p` is sorted in increasing order.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function runs a loop as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest integer in `p`.
     - In each iteration, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out by summing up 1 for each `x` in `p` where `x` is less than or equal to `n`.
     - It then decreases `n` by this sum.
   - **Output**: The function returns the final value of `n`, which is the number of players remaining after all rounds of the game.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The logic correctly simulates the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`.
     - The loop ensures that the game continues until no more players can be kicked out, which is when `n` is less than the smallest integer in `p`.
     - The function returns the correct number of remaining players.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input**: The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
     - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
     - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
     - It prints the results for each test case.
   - **Output**: The function prints the number of winners for each initial player count `n` in `qs` for each test case.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and collects the results.
     - However, there is a logical error in the printing part. The `print` statement is inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`, which means it prints the results after each `n` is processed, rather than after all `n` values have been processed for a test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but the `print` statement in `func_2` should be outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This ensures that the results for all `n` values in a test case are printed together.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
Move the `print` statement outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

This fix will ensure that the results for each test case are printed correctly.
