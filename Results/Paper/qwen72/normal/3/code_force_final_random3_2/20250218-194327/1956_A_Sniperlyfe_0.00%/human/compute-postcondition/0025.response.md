Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q and must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `n` is the second element in `qs`.**
