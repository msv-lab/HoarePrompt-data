Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it, `n` is the third element of `qs`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is the third element of `qs`.
- The function `func_1(n, p)` is called with `n` and `p` as arguments, and its result is appended to the list `res`.
- The initial state of `res` already contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, so after the code execution, `res` now contains two results of `func_1(n, p)`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is still the third element of `qs`.
