The only objects in the loop head are `n` and `qs`. The loop iterates over each element in `qs`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be set to the next element in `qs`, and `qs` must still have elements remaining.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` was the second element of `qs`.
- `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, and it has been updated to a list of integers from the user input.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` must be set to the third element of `qs`.
- `qs` must still have at least 3 elements (since the second element was the last one used).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, and `qs` has been updated to a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it, `n` is the third element of `qs`.**
