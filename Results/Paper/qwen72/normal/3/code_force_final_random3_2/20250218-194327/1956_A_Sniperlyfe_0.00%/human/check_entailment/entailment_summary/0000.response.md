Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players initially) and `p` (the list of positions to be removed).
   - It repeatedly subtracts the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` becomes less than the smallest integer in `p`.
   - This effectively simulates the rounds of the game where players are removed based on the positions in `p`.
   - The function returns the number of players remaining after all rounds, which is the number of winners.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from user input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of positions `k` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the list of positions `p` and the list of queries `qs`.
   - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to the list `res`.
   - After processing all queries for a test case, it prints the results in `res`.
   - The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game by removing players based on the positions in `p` and returns the number of winners.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_2` prints the results inside the loop for each query, which might lead to incorrect or redundant output. It should print the results after processing all queries for a test case.

5. **Corrected Function `func_2`:**
   - The function should collect all results for a test case and print them together after processing all queries.

Corrected Code for `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Given the reasoning and the corrected code, the program is correct in terms of logic and functionality, but the original `func_2` has a minor issue with the placement of the print statement.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect placement of the print statement in `func_2`).

If the print statement is moved outside the loop, the program would be correct.
