Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and correct method for finding the GCD.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic used in this function is flawed.
   - The program calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), and then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`. This logic does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem description.

To verify, let's manually check the pairs for \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- For \(a = 1\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 2\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) is not a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\). (Invalid pair)
  - \(b = 3\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)

- For \(a = 2\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 3\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)

Thus, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2), which gives a total of 3 valid pairs. However, the program's logic does not correctly count these pairs.

The program's logic in `func_2` is based on the incorrect assumption that the number of valid pairs can be calculated using the formula \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\). This formula does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
