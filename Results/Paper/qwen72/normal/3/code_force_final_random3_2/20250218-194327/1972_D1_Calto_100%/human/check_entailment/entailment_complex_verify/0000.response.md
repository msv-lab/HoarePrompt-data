Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and efficient method for finding the GCD.
   - The annotations for `func_1` are accurate and describe the function's behavior correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - However, the logic inside `func_2` is flawed. The calculation \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The program increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`, which is not the correct way to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the expected output is 3, as the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2) satisfy the conditions.
   - Let's manually check the pairs:
     - For \(a = 1\):
       - \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
       - \(b = 2\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) is not a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\). (Invalid pair)
       - \(b = 3\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)
     - For \(a = 2\):
       - \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
       - \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). (Valid pair)
       - \(b = 3\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)
   - Thus, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2), which gives a total of 3 valid pairs.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program's logic in `func_2` does not correctly count the pairs. It uses a formula that does not reflect the problem's conditions.
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
