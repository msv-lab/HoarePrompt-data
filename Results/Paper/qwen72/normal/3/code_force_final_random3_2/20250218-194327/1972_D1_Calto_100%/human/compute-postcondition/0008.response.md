Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1 + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0)`, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
- `math.ceil(n / 1)` is `n` because `n` is a positive integer.
- `(n % 1 == 0)` is always `1` because `n` is a positive integer.
- Therefore, the initial value of `cnt` is `n + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- `x` is `n - 2`.
- `y` is 4.
- `math.ceil((n - 2) / 4)` calculates the ceiling of `(n - 2) / 4`.
- `(x % y == 0)` checks if `(n - 2) % 4` is 0.
- The new value of `cnt` is `n + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0)`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
