The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers within the ranges `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. After the function concludes, `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.
