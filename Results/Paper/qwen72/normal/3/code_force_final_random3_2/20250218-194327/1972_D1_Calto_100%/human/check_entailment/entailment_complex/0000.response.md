Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The function correctly computes the GCD and returns it.
   - The state comments are accurate: the loop terminates when `b` becomes 0, and `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function initializes `cnt` to -1, which is unusual and suggests a potential off-by-one error.
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`.
   - It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The logic of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b` (or `i` in this context).

3. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The formula `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is derived from the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the initialization of `cnt` to -1 is incorrect. It should be initialized to 0 to avoid an off-by-one error.
   - The correct initialization would be `cnt = 0`.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`, calling `func_2(n, m)`, and printing the result.
   - The main logic of counting valid pairs is implemented in `func_2`, but the initialization of `cnt` is incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the off-by-one error in the initialization of `cnt` in `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
