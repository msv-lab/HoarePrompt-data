Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates over each integer \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The key issue is in the logic used to count the valid pairs. The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly reflect this condition.

Let's manually verify the pairs for \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- For \(a = 1\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 2\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) is not a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\). (Invalid pair)
  - \(b = 3\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)

- For \(a = 2\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 3\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)

Thus, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), which gives a total of 3 valid pairs.

However, the program's logic in `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs. The calculation \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) does not align with the problem's requirement to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be performing a different calculation that does not match the problem's conditions.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
