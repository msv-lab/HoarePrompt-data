The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `w`. The loop can execute again if `w` is greater than the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, the state of `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3. However, since `_` is not used in the loop head to determine the number of iterations, it does not need to be adjusted. Instead, the loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_` plus 1. Since `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, we can infer that the loop will execute again if `w` is greater than the number of times the loop has already run.

State: **`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`**
