Output State: **`pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element of `pl`, if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` is executed.
- `j` is the third element of `pl`.
- If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3.
- If `d[j]` is less than 3, `shapes` remains unchanged.
- The list `pl` and the value of `j` are not affected by this code.
