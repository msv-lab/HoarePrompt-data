The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `palka`. The loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more element in `palka` to be processed. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element in `palka`, and `palka` must have at least 1 element for the loop to have executed up to this point. For the loop to execute again, `palka` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be the second element in `palka`.

State: **`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with a value of 1 (if `d.get(i)` was `None`) or the value of `d[i]` incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`).**
