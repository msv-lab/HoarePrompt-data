The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `pl`. Therefore, we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `pl` has at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element of `pl`. For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least 2 elements, and `j` will be the second element of `pl`.

State: **`pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element of `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.**
