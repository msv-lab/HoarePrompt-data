Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 0, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`shapes` is 0 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is `d[j] // 3`. `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `w` is greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element of `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`shapes` is 0 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is `d[j] // 3`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is updated to `shapes` + `d[j] // 3`. In all cases, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `w` is greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element of `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `shapes` is 0 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is updated to `shapes` + `d[j] // 3`. In all cases, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `w` is greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element of `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
