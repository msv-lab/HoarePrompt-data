Output State: **`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with a value of 2 (if `d.get(i)` was `None` initially) or the value of `d[i]` incremented by 2 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially).**
