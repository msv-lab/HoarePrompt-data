Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that has been fully iterated over; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appeared in `palka`; `shapes` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `shapes`, which is now set to 0.
