### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 500,000 times.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index]` using dynamic programming.
   - **Memoization**: It uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Base Case**: When `start_index == end_index`, the function returns the maximum of 1 and the single element in the subarray. This is correct because the MEX of a single-element subarray is either 0 or 1, and setting the element to 1 maximizes the sum.
   - **Recursive Case**: The function attempts to compute the maximum sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the MEX value of the subarray. However, the MEX value is not correctly computed. The function uses a heuristic that is not aligned with the MEX definition.
   - **Heuristic Error**: The function uses `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2` as an initial value for `res`, which is not a valid MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not a square of the subarray length.
   - **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls to `func_1` are intended to explore different subarray splits, but the MEX value is not correctly used in these calculations.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - **Logical Error**: The function checks if the maximum value is equal to `length ** 2`. This condition is not aligned with the MEX operation and the problem's requirements. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - **Backtracking**: The function tries to backtrack to find the operations that lead to the maximum value. However, due to the incorrect MEX computation in `func_1`, the backtracking logic is flawed and does not correctly reconstruct the sequence of operations.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - **Staircase Check**: The function checks if the subarray is already a staircase and returns if it is. This is a good idea, but the implementation is incorrect.
   - **Recursive Transformation**: The function recursively transforms the subarray. However, the updates to the array are not aligned with the problem's requirements. The function sets all elements in the subarray to the same value, which is not necessarily the MEX value.
   - **MEX Transformation Error**: The function does not correctly handle the MEX transformation. It should compute the MEX of the subarray and set all elements in the subarray to this MEX value, but it does not do this.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - **MEX Computation**: The program does not correctly compute the MEX value, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem.
   - **Backtracking Logic**: The backtracking logic in `func_2` is flawed due to the incorrect MEX computation in `func_1`.
   - **Staircase Transformation**: The `make_stairs` function does not correctly transform the subarray into the desired MEX values.
   - **Incorrect Results**: Due to these errors, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for maximizing the sum and constructing the sequence of operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program contains logical errors in the computation of the MEX value and the construction of the sequence of operations, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
