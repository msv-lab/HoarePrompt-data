Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`.***
