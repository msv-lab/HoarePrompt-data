### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of the elements in an array by performing a specific operation up to \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that computes the maximum sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - `func_2` is a recursive function that constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - `make_stairs` is a helper function that modifies the array to form a "staircase" pattern, which is used to achieve the MEX value.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The function uses memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
     - If the subarray has only one element, it returns the maximum of 1 and that element.
     - For longer subarrays, it computes the maximum sum by considering different splits and the MEX value of the subarray.
     - The function correctly updates the dictionary and returns the maximum sum.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function constructs the sequence of operations.
     - It first checks if the subarray is a single element and returns an empty list if the element is positive.
     - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it appends the entire subarray to the result and returns.
     - Otherwise, it recursively checks different splits to find the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.

   - **`make_stairs`**:
     - This function modifies the array to form a staircase pattern.
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired pattern and returns if it is.
     - If the subarray is not in the desired pattern, it recursively modifies the subarray and appends the operation to the result.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case for a single-element subarray.
   - The recursive splitting and MEX computation in `func_1` are logically sound and correctly compute the maximum sum.
   - The sequence of operations constructed in `func_2` and `make_stairs` are consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

### Conclusion:
The given program is logically correct and meets the problem's requirements. It correctly computes the maximum sum and constructs a sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

Correctness: **True**
