Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 1`, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + j < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. If the element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.***
