Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i - 1 + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i - 1 < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, and `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i - 1` is not equal to `j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`. The element at index `start_index + i - 1` in `arr` is not equal to `i - 1`.**
