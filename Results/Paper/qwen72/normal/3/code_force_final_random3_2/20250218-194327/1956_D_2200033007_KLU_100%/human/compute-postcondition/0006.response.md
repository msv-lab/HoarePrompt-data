Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `is_already_stairs` is explicitly set to `False` by the code.
- The values of `i`, `j`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- The conditions `i + 1 > 0`, `start_index + i < len(arr)`, and the structure of `res` are still valid.
- The condition that `is_already_stairs` is `False` if the element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` is not equal to `j` is no longer relevant because `is_already_stairs` is now explicitly `False`.
