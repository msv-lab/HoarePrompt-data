Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. If any element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` remains a non-negative integer, and the loop has run `i + 1` times.
- The variable `j` will be equal to `i` after the loop finishes.
- The list `arr` and the integer `start_index` remain unchanged, with the condition that `start_index + i` is still less than the length of `arr`.
- The list `res` remains unchanged.
- The variable `is_already_stairs` will be `False` if any element in the sublist `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` does not match its index (i.e., `arr[start_index + j] != j` for any `j` in the range `0` to `i`). Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` will remain `True`.
