You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, and `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. If any element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`, `j` is `start_index + i`, and for all indices `k` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive), `arr[k]` is `i`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`. If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, the function `make_stairs` is called with `i - 1` as the argument. Otherwise, for all indices `k` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive), `arr[k]` is `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, with `i` now being `i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `i` and, depending on the internal logic, either returns `None` or does not return anything.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
