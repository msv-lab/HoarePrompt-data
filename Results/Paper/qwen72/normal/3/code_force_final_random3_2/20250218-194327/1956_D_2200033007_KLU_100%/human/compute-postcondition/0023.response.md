Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i - 1 + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i - 1 < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i - 1` is not equal to `j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`. The element at index `start_index + i - 1` in `arr` is not equal to `i - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- `i` is updated to `i - 1`, so the new value of `i` is `i - 1`.
- `j` is now `i - 1` because `j` is always equal to `i`.
- The condition `i + 1 > 0` is still valid, but it is now `i - 1 + 1 > 0`.
- The condition `start_index + i < len(arr)` is still valid, but it is now `start_index + i - 1 < len(arr)`.
- The condition `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i - 1` is not equal to `j`.
- The condition that `i` is not equal to `0` is still valid.
- The element at index `start_index + i - 1` in `arr` is not equal to `i - 1`.
- The states of `arr` and `res` remain unchanged.
