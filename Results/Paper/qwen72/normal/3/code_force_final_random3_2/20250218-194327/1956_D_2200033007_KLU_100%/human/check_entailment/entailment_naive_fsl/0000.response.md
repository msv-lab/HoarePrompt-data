Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the MEX operation as defined in the problem description. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. However, the `func_1` and `func_2` functions do not compute the MEX of the subarray and instead seem to be attempting to maximize a different value, which does not align with the problem's requirements. Additionally, the `make_stairs` function appears to be an attempt to transform the array into a specific pattern, but it does not clearly follow the logic required to maximize the sum by applying the MEX operation correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
The MEX of the entire array is 0, and applying the operation with `l=1` and `r=4` should result in the array becoming `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, which would not maximize the sum. The program's logic does not correctly identify and apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array elements.
