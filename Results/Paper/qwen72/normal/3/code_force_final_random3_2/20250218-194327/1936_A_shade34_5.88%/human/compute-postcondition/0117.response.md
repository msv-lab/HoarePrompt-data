Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `_` is 1.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `s` is the new input string.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - If `s` is '<', `pans` is a list containing `[1]`, and `mak` is 1.
   - If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`, and `mak` is 1.
   - If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains an empty list, and `mak` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element printed is the string `'?'`.
   - The second element printed is `mak`.
   - The third element printed is `mak2`, which is equal to `mak`.
   - The fourth element printed is `i`, which is 2.
   - The fifth element printed is `mak2`, which is again equal to `mak`.

4. **Evaluate Based on `s`:**
   - If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is also 1.
   - If `s` is '=', then `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is also 1.
   - If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', then `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is also 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `s` is '<' or '=':
     - `mak` is 1.
     - `mak2` is 1.
     - `i` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 1`.
   - If `s` is neither '<' nor '=':
     - `mak` is 0.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `i` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 0`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? 1 1 2 1 (if s is '<' or '=') or ? 0 0 2 0 (if s is neither '<' nor '=')**
