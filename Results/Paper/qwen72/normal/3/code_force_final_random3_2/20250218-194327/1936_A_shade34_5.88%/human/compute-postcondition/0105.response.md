Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. The output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the input string, which is not equal to '<'.***
