Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was ever input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
