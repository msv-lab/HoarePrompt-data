Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the new input string, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[2]`, and `mak` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` to `pans`.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `pans` becomes `[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
