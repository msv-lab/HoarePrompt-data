Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<', `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterated over.
- The value of `_` remains 2, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The list `pans` contains the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<'.
- The variable `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'.
- The variable `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- The output buffer has been flushed, ensuring all printed outputs have been sent to the console.
