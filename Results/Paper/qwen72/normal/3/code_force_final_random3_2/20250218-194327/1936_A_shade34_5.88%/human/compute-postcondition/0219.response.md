Output State: **_ is t-1, n is the input integer, i is n-1, `mak` is the largest index in `pans` for which the input was '>', `mak2` is the largest index for which the input was '<', `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the input was '=' or the last index for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `_` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will be the last input integer for the final test case. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index of the range for the final test case. The variable `mak` will hold the largest index in the `pans` list for which the input was '>', and `mak2` will hold the largest index for which the input was '<'. The list `pans` will contain all indices for which the input was '=' or the last index for which the input was '<' for the final test case. Finally, the output buffer will have been flushed, ensuring that all outputs have been written.
