Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<'. The output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop.
- The variable `_` remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `pans` contains all indices `i` where the user input `s` was '=' and the last index `i` where the user input `s` was '<'.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration, ensuring that all print statements were executed.
- The variable `mak` holds the largest index `i` for which the user input `s` was '<'.
- The variable `mak2` is equal to `mak`, reflecting the last update of `mak` during the loop execution.
