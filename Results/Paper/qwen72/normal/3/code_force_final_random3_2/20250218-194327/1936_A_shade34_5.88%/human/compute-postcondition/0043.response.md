The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is not '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is either '<' or '=', and `s` is the input string.**
