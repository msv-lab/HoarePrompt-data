Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', the output buffer has been flushed, and the current input is '>'**. 

The value of `mak` is updated to `n-1`, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
