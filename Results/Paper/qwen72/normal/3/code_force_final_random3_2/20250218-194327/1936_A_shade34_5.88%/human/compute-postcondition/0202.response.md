Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `_`, `pans`, `mak`, or `mak2`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the output buffer has been flushed.
