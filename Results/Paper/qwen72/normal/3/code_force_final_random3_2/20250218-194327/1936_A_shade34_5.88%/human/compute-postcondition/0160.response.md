The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 3).

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string equal to `<`, then `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 2.**
