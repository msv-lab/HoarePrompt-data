The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and since the loop has executed once, `_` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again is that the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **_ is 1, n is greater than 3, i is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
