Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, but it does not change any of the variables. Therefore, all the initial state information remains valid.
