Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` refers to the first element of the list `pans`.
   - `mak2` is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `i` is `n-1`, and since `n` is greater than 3, `i` is at least 2 (i.e., `n-1` where `n > 3`).
   - `pans[i]` refers to the element at index `i` of the list `pans`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with a question mark (`?`).
   - It will then print the first element of `pans` twice.
   - It will then print the element at index `i` of `pans` twice.

Since the exact values of the elements in the `pans` list are not provided, we can only describe them based on their positions in the list.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where `pans[0]` is the first element of the `pans` list and `pans[i]` is the element at index `i` of the `pans` list, with `i` being `n-1` and `n` is greater than 3)**
