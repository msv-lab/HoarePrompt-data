Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '>'.
   - `mak2` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is a detail about the environment, not directly relevant to the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('!', mak2, mak)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '!', followed by the values of `mak2` and `mak`.
   - `mak2` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'.
   - `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '>'.
   - Since the exact values of `mak2` and `mak` depend on the input sequence, we can't determine their exact numerical values without the specific input sequence. However, we know they are indices based on the input conditions.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string that starts with '!', followed by the values of `mak2` and `mak`.

Output: **! [mak2] [mak] (where [mak2] is the largest index `i` for which the input was '<' and [mak] is the largest index `i` for which the input was '>')**
