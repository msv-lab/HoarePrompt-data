Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now contains the list [v, v, v], `nodes[v]` now contains the list [u, u].**

The code `nodes[u].append(v)` adds another `v` to the list `nodes[u]`, so `nodes[u]` now contains `[v, v, v]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
