To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `n`

The loop will execute if `range(n - 1)` generates at least one value. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies that `n` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `t` is an integer and always equals 1
- `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list
- `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n
- `edges` is an empty list
- `empty` is True

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is already given to be at least 2, it satisfies this condition. The variable `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will be set to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The initial state already ensures that the loop will run at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer and always equals 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 0**
