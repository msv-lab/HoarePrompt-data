Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes, `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must contain at least one key, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes, `leaves` is a deque. If `len(nodes[key])` is 1, `leaves` contains the key `key`, and the node `key` has exactly one connection. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must contain at least two keys, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes, `leaves` is a deque. If `len(nodes[key])` is 1, `leaves` contains the key `key`, and the node `key` has exactly one connection. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque. `key` is the next key in `nodes` that has not been processed yet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must contain at least two keys, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes. If `len(nodes[key])` is 1, `leaves` is a deque containing the key `key`, and the node `key` has exactly one connection. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque. `key` is the next key in `nodes` that has not been processed yet.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
