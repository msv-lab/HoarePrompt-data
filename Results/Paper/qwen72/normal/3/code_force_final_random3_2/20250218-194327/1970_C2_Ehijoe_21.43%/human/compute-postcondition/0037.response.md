Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` (which is always 1) from user input, then reads `n-1` pairs of integers representing edges in a graph and constructs an adjacency list `nodes` from these edges. It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one connection) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. The function then reads an integer `start` from user input and calls another function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. Based on the result of `func_1`, which is a list of integers `moves`, the function prints 'Ron' if any of the integers in `moves` is odd, and 'Hermione' if all integers in `moves` are even. The function does not return any value. **
