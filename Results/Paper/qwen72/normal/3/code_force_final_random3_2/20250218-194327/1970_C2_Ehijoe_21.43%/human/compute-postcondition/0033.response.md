Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and contains all keys representing nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connection, `moves` is the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)`, and all elements in `moves` are even.**
