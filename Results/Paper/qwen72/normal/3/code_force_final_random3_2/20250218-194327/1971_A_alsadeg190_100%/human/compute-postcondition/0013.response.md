The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `x` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `x` must be greater than 2).

State: **`x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `i` is 2. If the new `x` is less than the new `y`, then `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. Additionally, `x` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.**
