You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of two integers (x, y) such that 0 <= x, y <= 9. The number of test cases, t, should be a non-negative integer where 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `x` times, where `x` is the initial value provided in the test case. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers. If the new `x` is less than the new `y`, then `x` and `y` are printed in that order. Otherwise, `y` and `x` are printed in that order. The value of `i` is `x-1` after the final iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, each a tuple of two integers (x, y) where 0 <= x, y <= 9, and returns a list of results. Each result is "Equal" if x is equal to y, "Greater" if x is greater than y, or "Less" if x is less than y.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
