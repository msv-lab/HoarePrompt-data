The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of two integers (x, y) such that 0 <= x, y <= 9. The number of test cases, t, should be a non-negative integer where 1 <= t <= 100. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. Each result corresponds to the test case and is determined as follows:
- Case_1: If x is equal to y, the function returns "Equal" for that test case.
- Case_2: If x is greater than y, the function returns "Greater" for that test case.
- Case_3: If x is less than y, the function returns "Less" for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each a tuple of two integers (x, y) where 0 <= x, y <= 9, and returns a list of results. Each result is "Equal" if x is equal to y, "Greater" if x is greater than y, or "Less" if x is less than y.**
