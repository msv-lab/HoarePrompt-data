Output State: **The loop has executed `x` times, where `x` is the initial value provided in the test case. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers. If the new `x` is less than the new `y`, then `x` and `y` are printed in that order. Otherwise, `y` and `x` are printed in that order. The value of `i` is `x-1` after the final iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the initial value provided in the test case.
- For each iteration, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers.
- The loop prints the values of `x` and `y` in ascending order.
- After the loop finishes, the value of `i` is `x-1` because the loop index `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration, reaching `x-1` in the final iteration.
