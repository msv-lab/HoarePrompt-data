You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `x` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, and prints them in ascending order. The function performs this action for each of the `x` test cases. After the function concludes, the input values have been processed and printed, but no data is returned or stored.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined without any parameters, which is appropriate for this problem since it reads input directly.
   - The first input is the number of test cases `t`, which is correctly read as an integer using `int(input())`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases:**
   - The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the number of test cases `t`. This is correct as it ensures that the program processes each test case.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - Inside the loop, the program reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is a standard and correct way to read multiple integers from a single line of input.

4. **Determining Minimum and Maximum:**
   - The program checks if `x` is less than `y` using an `if` statement.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is not less than `y` (i.e., `x` is greater than or equal to `y`), it prints `y` followed by `x`.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case, separated by a space.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine and print the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case. The input and output handling are also correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
