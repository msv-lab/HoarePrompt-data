Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The logic used to determine the minimum and maximum values is straightforward and works correctly for all possible inputs within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). The program also correctly handles the edge case where `x` and `y` are equal, printing the same number twice as required. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
