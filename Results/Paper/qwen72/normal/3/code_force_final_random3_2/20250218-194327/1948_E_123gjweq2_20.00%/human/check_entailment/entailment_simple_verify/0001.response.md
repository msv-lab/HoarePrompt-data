### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex and then partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the edge condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques needed and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` assigns values to the vertices and determines their clique membership.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculation is correct. It ensures that the number of cliques is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(n / k\).
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are correctly initialized to store the assigned values and the clique membership of each vertex.
   - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the start and end indices of the vertices for that clique and the clique number.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - `small_element = left + 1`: This is the smallest element to be assigned in the current range.
   - `big_element = right + 1`: This is the largest element to be assigned in the current range.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the range, which is used to split the assignment into two parts.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements that will be assigned in the second part.
   - The first loop `for i in range(mid)` assigns the smaller elements to the first half of the range and sets their clique membership.
   - The second loop `for i in range(not_mid)` assigns the larger elements to the second half of the range and sets their clique membership.

5. **Edge Condition**:
   - The program should ensure that the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) holds for all pairs of vertices in the same clique.
   - The way `make_array` assigns values ensures that the difference \(|a_i - a_j|\) is minimized within each clique, which helps in satisfying the edge condition.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique membership for each vertex.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 2\), \(k = 3\)
  - `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`
  - `arr = [2, 1]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1]`
  - The condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 3\) holds for all pairs \((i, j)\) in the same clique.
  - Output is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: \(n = 5\), \(k = 4\)
  - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
  - `arr = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
  - The condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4\) holds for all pairs \((i, j)\) in the same clique.
  - Output is correct.

- **Test Case 3**: \(n = 8\), \(k = 16\)
  - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
  - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - The condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 16\) holds for all pairs \((i, j)\) in the same clique.
  - Output is correct.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` correctly calls `make_array` for each clique.
  - The state after the loop is correctly described: `arr` contains the assigned values, `cliques` is the number of cliques, and `cliquess` contains the clique membership of each vertex.
  - The print statements correctly output the required values.

- **Function `make_array`**:
  - The calculation of `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` is correct.
  - The loops correctly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` based on the calculated midpoints.
  - The state after the loops is correctly described: `arr` and `cliquess` are updated as required.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and assign values to the vertices such that the edge condition is satisfied. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.
