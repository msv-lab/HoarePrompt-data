To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(not_mid):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[0, not_mid-1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`.
- `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`.

At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the variable `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `not_mid`**.
