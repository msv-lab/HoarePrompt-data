The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `mid`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `mid`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `mid` must remain greater than `i`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `mid` remains the same, and it must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is `i + 1` and `mid` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
