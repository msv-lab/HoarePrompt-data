To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions provided:

1. **Loop Head**: `for i in range(not_mid):`
   - The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0.

2. **Given States**:
   - `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`.
   - `clique` is a positive integer.
   - `small_element` is `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0.
   - `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`.
   - `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0.
   - `not_mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) - mid`.
   - For `not_mid` to be greater than 0, `(right - left + 1) - mid > 0`.
   - Given `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, we can substitute and simplify:
     - `not_mid = (right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`.
     - This simplifies to `not_mid = (right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`.
     - For `not_mid` to be greater than 0, `(right - left + 1) > (right - left) // 2`.

4. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`.
   - `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, which implies `right - left > 0`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0.
   - For `not_mid` to be greater than 0, `right - left` must be greater than 0, ensuring that `mid` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `left` and `right` must be such that `right > left`.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, and `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`**.
