Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, and `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions remain true:
- `left` and `right` are still non-negative integers, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- `clique` is still a positive integer.
- `small_element` is still `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is still `right + 1`.
- `mid` is still `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0.
- `not_mid` is still `(right - left + 1) - mid`.

However, the loop has modified the elements of the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`:
- For all indices `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, the element `arr[left + i]` has been set to `left + 1 + i`.
- For all indices `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, the element `cliquess[left + i]` has been set to `clique`.

This means that the first `mid` elements starting from `left` in the `arr` array have been updated to a sequence starting from `left + 1`, and the corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array have been set to the value of `clique`.
