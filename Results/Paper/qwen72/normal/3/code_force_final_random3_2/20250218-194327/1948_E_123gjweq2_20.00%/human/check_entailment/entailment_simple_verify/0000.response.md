### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Scope:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `make_array` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`. This will indeed cause a runtime error when the program is executed. The function `make_array` is defined outside of `func_1`, but it is not imported or referenced correctly within `func_1`.

2. **Logic for Generating Cliques:**
   - The logic for generating the cliques in the `make_array` function is intended to assign integers to vertices and determine the cliques. However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The `make_array` function is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays with values that satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
     - The current implementation of `make_array` does not ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. It simply assigns values in a linear fashion, which may not satisfy the condition for all pairs.

3. **Example Input:**
   - For the input `2 3`, the program should output:
     ```
     2 1
     1
     1 1
     ```
   - The current implementation will not produce this output because:
     - The `make_array` function is not defined within the scope of `func_1`.
     - The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation would need to ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. This might involve a more complex algorithm to assign values to `arr` and determine the cliques.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the undefined `make_array` function and the flawed logic for generating the cliques.
- The program will not produce the correct output for the given problem description and input constraints.

Final: **False**
