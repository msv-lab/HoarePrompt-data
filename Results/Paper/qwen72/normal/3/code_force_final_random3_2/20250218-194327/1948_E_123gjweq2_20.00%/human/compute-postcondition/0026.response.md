Functionality: ** The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function updates two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right` are filled with a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` up to `right + 1`, with the first half of the sequence in ascending order and the second half in descending order. The elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are all set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value. **
