The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 2n. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k` and assigns each element in a list `arr` of length `n` to a clique index (1 to the number of cliques). The function then prints the elements of `arr`, followed by the number of cliques, and finally prints a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.
