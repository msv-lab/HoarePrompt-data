Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`, `i` is `i + 1` and `mid` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` updates the value of `arr[left + i]`.
- `arr[left + i]` was initially `left + 1 + i`.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- Therefore, `arr[left + i]` becomes `left + 1 + i`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The condition `mid` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid after the increment.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
