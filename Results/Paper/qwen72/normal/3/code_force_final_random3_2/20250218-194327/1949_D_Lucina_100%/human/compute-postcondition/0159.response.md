Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1. If the character at position `i` in the string `xx` (which is 2) and the character at position `j - 1` (which is 0) in the same string `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position 2 in the string `xx`. Otherwise, if the character at position `i` in the string `xx` at index `j - 1` is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
