Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n`, and `x` is the new input string. If the second character of `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the second character of `x` is not 'F' and the first character of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[n]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[1]` and `b[n]` remain unchanged.***
