The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for j in range(1, n + 1)` will execute if `n` is at least 1. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, the loop will execute. However, the variable `j` needs to be initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1**
