Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is the input string, the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', `b[i]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[i]` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `i` is `n + 1`, so `b[n + 1]` is increased by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
