The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, and `j` is 3. The value of `j - 1` is 2, so the code adds the value at `xx[1][2]` to `nx`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is updated by adding the value at `xx[1][2]` to its current value.**
