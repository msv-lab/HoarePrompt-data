The code snippet provided attempts to concatenate a string `'S'` to a variable `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, which would result in a `NameError` in Python. Since the code cannot be executed due to this error, the variables `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, and an error occurs because `nx` is not defined.**
