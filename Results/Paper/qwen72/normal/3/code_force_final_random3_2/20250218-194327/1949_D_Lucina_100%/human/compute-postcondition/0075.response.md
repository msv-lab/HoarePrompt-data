Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n`, `x` is the new input string, `b[n]` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `b[n]` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `j`, `xx`, and `x` remain unchanged. If the second character of `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the second character of `x` is not 'F' and the first character of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[n]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[1]` and `b[n]` remain unchanged.
