The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24
- `j` is 1
- `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x` as its last element
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `x` is the input string

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2
- `n` must still be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24 for the loop to continue executing

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is the input string**
