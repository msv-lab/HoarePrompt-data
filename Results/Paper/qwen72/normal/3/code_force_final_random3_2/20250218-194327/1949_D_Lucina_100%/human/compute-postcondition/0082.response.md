The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the value of `b[n]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n`, `x` is the new input string, `b[n]` is incremented by 1. If the second character of `x` is 'F', `a[j]` and `a[n]` are incremented by 1. If the second character of `x` is not 'F' and the first character of `x` is 'S', `b[j]` and `b[n]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[1]` and `b[n]` remain unchanged.**
