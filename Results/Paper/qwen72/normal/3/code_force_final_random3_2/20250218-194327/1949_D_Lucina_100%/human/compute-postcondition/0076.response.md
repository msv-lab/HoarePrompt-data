Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n`, `x` is the new input string, `b[j]` is incremented by 1, `b[n]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[j]` is incremented by 1, where `j` is 2. So, `b[2]` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `b[n]` is also incremented by 1, as specified in the initial state.
- All other variables (`n`, `j`, `xx`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
