The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` of the list `b` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `b` or `i`, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `b[i]`. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**
