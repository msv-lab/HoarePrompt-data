Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is either 'FS' or 'SS'.**

Explanation:
- `nx` is initially determined based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
- If the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is set to that character.
- If the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` is '?', and either `i` (which is 3) or `j` (which is 2) is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is set to 'F'.
- Otherwise, `nx` is set to 'S'.
- The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the existing value of `nx`.
- Therefore, `nx` will be either 'FS' or 'SS' depending on the initial conditions. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
