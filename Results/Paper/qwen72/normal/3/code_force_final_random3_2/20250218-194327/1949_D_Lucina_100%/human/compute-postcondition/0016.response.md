The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 24.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the value at index 1 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged.**
