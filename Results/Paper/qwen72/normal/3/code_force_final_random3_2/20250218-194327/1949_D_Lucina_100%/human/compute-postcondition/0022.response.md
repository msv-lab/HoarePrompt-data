Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1, and the value at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the value at index 2 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value at index 1 of the list `a` remains unchanged, and the value at index 2 of the list `b` remains unchanged.***
