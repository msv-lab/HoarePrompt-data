Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3. If `x[2]` is 'F', then the value at index `i` of the list `a` is incremented by 1, and the value at index 3 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. If `x[2]` is 'S', then `b[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.***
