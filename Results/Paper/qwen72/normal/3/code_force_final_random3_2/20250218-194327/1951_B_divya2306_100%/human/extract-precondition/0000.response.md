Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow (1-indexed), and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It is guaranteed that `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= n`, `1 <= ratings[i] <= 10^9`, and all `ratings[i]` are distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`.**
