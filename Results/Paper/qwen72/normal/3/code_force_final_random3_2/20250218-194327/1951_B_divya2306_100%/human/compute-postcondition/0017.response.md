Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is the last index of the iteration (i.e., `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking), `wins` is the number of iterations where `a[i]` was not greater than `a[k - 1]`. The current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
