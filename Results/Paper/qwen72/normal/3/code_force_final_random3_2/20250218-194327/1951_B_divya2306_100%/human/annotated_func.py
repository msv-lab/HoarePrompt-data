#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow (1-indexed), and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It is guaranteed that `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= n`, `1 <= ratings[i] <= 10^9`, and all `ratings[i]` are distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is the last index of the iteration (i.e., `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking), `wins` is the number of iterations where `a[i]` was not greater than `a[k - 1]`.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of iterations where `a[i]` was not greater than `a[k - 1]` and wins is greater than or equal to k)
        return
        #The program returns the value of `wins`, which is the number of iterations where `a[i]` was not greater than `a[k - 1]`, and `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    #State: *`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is the last index of the iteration (i.e., `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking), `wins` is the number of iterations where `a[i]` was not greater than `a[k - 1]`, and `wins` is less than `k`.
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + (k - win_with_swap)`, and `i` is `k - 2`. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: (k - wins - 2) / 2 + (wins != 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `max_wins` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of cows), `k` (the index of your cow, 1-indexed), and `ratings` (a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows). It calculates the maximum number of cows whose ratings are not greater than the rating of your cow, such that this number is at least `k - 1`. If the number of such cows is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints and returns `wins - 1`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of cows that can be added to the initial count by swapping, and prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and the adjusted count. The function does not return a value in the latter case.
