The function `max_wins` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of cows), `k` (the index of your cow, 1-indexed), and `ratings` (a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows). It calculates the maximum number of cows whose ratings are not greater than the rating of your cow, such that this number is at least `k - 1`. If the number of such cows is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints and returns `wins - 1`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of cows that can be added to the initial count by swapping, and prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and the adjusted count. The function does not return a value in the latter case.
