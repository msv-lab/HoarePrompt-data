The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `N` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1**
