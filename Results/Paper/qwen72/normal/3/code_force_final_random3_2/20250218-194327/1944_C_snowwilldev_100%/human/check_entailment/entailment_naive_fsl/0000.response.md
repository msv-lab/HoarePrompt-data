Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the turn-based nature of the game and the strategic choices each player would make to maximize or minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice starts first and can choose the element `2` (since it appears twice, she can ensure that at least one `2` is in `c`).
- Bob then removes one of the remaining elements, say `0`.
- Alice then removes the other `2`.
- Bob removes the last element, `1`.

At the end, `c = [2, 2]`, and the MEX of `c` is `0`, `1`, and `3` (since `2` is present twice, the smallest missing non-negative integer is `3`).

However, the program returns `1` because it incorrectly assumes that the presence of a single unique element (in this case, `0`) will determine the MEX, without considering the optimal moves of both players. The correct MEX should be `3` if both players play optimally.
