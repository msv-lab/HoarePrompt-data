The value of `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentioned that `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 2, but this does not affect the current operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.**
