### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - Inside each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. This is a good approach because it allows for efficient counting and lookup.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to determine the MEX.
   - It uses a variable `t` to count how many elements have exactly one occurrence in the array.
   - The loop returns the smallest index `i` where either:
     - `cnt[i]` is 0 (meaning `i` is not in the array `a`).
     - `t` is greater than or equal to 2 (meaning there are at least two elements with exactly one occurrence, which implies that the MEX can be determined).

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The logic of the program aligns with the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Alice will always try to pick elements that are not already in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to pick elements that are already in `c` or are the smallest available to minimize the MEX.
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in the array `a` or the smallest integer that can be excluded by the presence of at least two elements with exactly one occurrence.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array `a` is empty or contains all the same elements.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array `a` contains all integers from 0 to `N-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob play optimally. The function `func_1` correctly processes the input and returns the correct MEX value for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
