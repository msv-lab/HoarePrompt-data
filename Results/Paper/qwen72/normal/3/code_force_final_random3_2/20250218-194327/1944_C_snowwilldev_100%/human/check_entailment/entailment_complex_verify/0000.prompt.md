You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. The list `a` contains integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `N` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop will return the smallest index `i` such that `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` is greater than or equal to 2. If no such index is found, `i` will be `N + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers `a`. It counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and returns the smallest index `i` where either the count of `i` in `cnt` is 0 or the count of unique integers with exactly one occurrence (`t`) is greater than or equal to 2. If no such index is found, the function returns `N + 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the turn-based nature of the game and the strategic choices each player would make to maximize or minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice starts first and can choose the element `2` (since it appears twice, she can ensure that at least one `2` is in `c`).
- Bob then removes one of the remaining elements, say `0`.
- Alice then removes the other `2`.
- Bob removes the last element, `1`.

At the end, `c = [2, 2]`, and the MEX of `c` is `0`, `1`, and `3` (since `2` is present twice, the smallest missing non-negative integer is `3`).

However, the program returns `1` because it incorrectly assumes that the presence of a single unique element (in this case, `0`) will determine the MEX, without considering the optimal moves of both players. The correct MEX should be `3` if both players play optimally.
