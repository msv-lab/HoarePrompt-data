Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is 2 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0, and `cnt[i]` is not 0. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program returns the value of `i`, which is `k + 1`. Otherwise, `t` and `cnt[i]` retain their values, and the program does not return anything.***
