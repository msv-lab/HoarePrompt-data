Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `N-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `N` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations that the loop has run. The variable `i` will be equal to `N-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. The `cnt` dictionary will have incremented the count for each element `a[i]` by 1, where `i` ranges from 0 to `N-1`. This means that for each unique integer in the list `a`, the corresponding value in the `cnt` dictionary will be the number of times that integer appears in the list.
