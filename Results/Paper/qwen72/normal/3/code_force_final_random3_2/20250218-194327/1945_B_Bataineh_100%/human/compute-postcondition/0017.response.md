Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are new input integers. If the new `m` is less than both the new `a` and the new `b`, then the current value of `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. If the new `m` is greater than or equal to the new `a` or the new `b`, then `m` is either less than or equal to `a` or greater than or equal to `b`. If the new `m` is between the new `a` and the new `b`, then `m` is between `a` and `b`.**
