Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.
   - `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b` (i.e., \(a < m < b\)).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 + m // a)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The expression `m // a` performs integer division, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division of `m` by `a`.
   - Since `m` is greater than `a` (i.e., \(m > a\)), the result of `m // a` will be at least 1.
   - The expression `2 + m // a` adds 2 to the result of the integer division.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The value of `m // a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - Therefore, the value of `2 + m // a` will be an integer greater than or equal to 3.

Since the exact values of `m` and `a` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `2 + m // a`. However, we can describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **2 + m // a (where m // a is the integer division of m by a, and m is greater than a and less than b)**
