Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.
   - `m` is greater than `b` and less than `a` (i.e., \(b < m < a\)).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 + m // b)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The expression `m // b` performs integer division, which means it returns the quotient of `m` divided by `b` without the remainder.
   - Since \(b < m < a\), `m` is greater than `b` but less than `a`. This ensures that `m // b` is at least 1 (because `m` is greater than `b`).
   - The exact value of `m // b` depends on the specific values of `m` and `b`, but it will be an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `a // b`.
   - The expression `2 + m // b` adds 2 to the result of the integer division.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the integer value of `2 + m // b`.
   - Given the constraints, the minimum value of `m // b` is 1, so the minimum value of `2 + m // b` is 3.
   - The maximum value of `m // b` is less than `a // b`, so the maximum value of `2 + m // b` is less than `2 + a // b`.

Therefore, the output will be an integer value that is at least 3 and less than `2 + a // b`.

Output: **2 + m // b (where m // b is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than a // b)**
