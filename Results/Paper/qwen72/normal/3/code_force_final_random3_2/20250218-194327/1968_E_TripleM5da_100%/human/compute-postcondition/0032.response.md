Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n`**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` must have been greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` will have the value of `n` because the loop iterates from 3 to `n` inclusive, and `i` is incremented to `n` by the end of the loop.
