To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
```

Here are the variables and their roles:
- `i` is the loop variable.
- `n` is the upper bound of the range, which must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 (this variable is not in the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution).
- `n` is an input integer greater than the previous value of `n` (this implies that `n` is already greater than some previous value, but we need to ensure it is at least 3 for the loop to execute).
- `i` is 0 (this is the initial value of `i`, but it will be set by the loop).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is at least 3. The loop will start with `i` set to 3, and it will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 0**
