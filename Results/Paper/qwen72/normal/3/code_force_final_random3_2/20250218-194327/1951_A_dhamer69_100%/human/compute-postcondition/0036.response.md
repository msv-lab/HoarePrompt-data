Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string. If `n` == 2, the program executes the if part. If `s` == '00' or `s.count('11') == 1` and `s.count('1') == 2`, or `s.count('1') % 2 != 0`, the program also executes the if part. In all other cases, the program executes the else part, but since the postconditions for both parts are the same, the overall postcondition remains unchanged.**
