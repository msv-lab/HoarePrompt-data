Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the condition is met. If `count_1` is even, the condition is met only if the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2. Otherwise, either the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1, or `count_1` is not equal to 2.***
