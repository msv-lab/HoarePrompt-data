Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, and `s` is the new input string. If `n` == 2, the program retains the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`. If `n` != 2, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged if `count_1` (the number of '1' characters in `s`) is odd, or if `count_1` is even and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
