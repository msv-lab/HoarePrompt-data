Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `count_1` is even and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
