Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part, but since the postconditions for both parts are the same, the overall postcondition remains unchanged.***
