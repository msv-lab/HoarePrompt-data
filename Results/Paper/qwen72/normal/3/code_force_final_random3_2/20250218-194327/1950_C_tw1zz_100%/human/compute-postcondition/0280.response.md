Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of time conversions to be performed. For each of the `t` iterations, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" from the input, converts the hour part of `s` to a 12-hour format, and prints the converted time along with 'AM' or 'PM'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` iterations have been completed, and for each input string, the corresponding 12-hour formatted time has been printed. **
