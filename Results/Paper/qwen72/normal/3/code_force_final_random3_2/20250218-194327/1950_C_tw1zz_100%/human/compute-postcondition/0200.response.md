To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.

2. **Conditions for `h1` and `time`:**
   - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '04' to '11', `h1` is the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

Let's break down the print statement:
- `h1` is the hour part in 12-hour format based on the conditions.
- `':'` is a literal colon.
- `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
- `' '` is a literal space.
- `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions.
- `sep=''` means there will be no additional separator between the elements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `h1` and `time` based on `h`:**
   - If `h` is '01', '02', or '03', `h1` will be '01', '02', or '03' respectively, and `time` will be 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '04' to '11', `h1` will be the corresponding hour, and `time` will be 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '12', `h1` will be '12', and `time` will be 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` will be the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (i.e., '01' for '13', '02' for '14', ..., '11' for '23'), and `time` will be 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '00', `h1` will be '12', and `time` will be 'AM'.
   - If `h` does not match any of the above conditions, `h1` and `time` will be empty strings.

2. **Construct the Output:**
   - The output will be a string in the format `h1:m time` (without any additional spaces or separators).

### Example Scenarios:
- If `s` is "01:30", then `h` is '01' and `m` is '30'. According to the conditions, `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **01:30 AM**

- If `s` is "12:45", then `h` is '12' and `m` is '45'. According to the conditions, `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **12:45 PM**

- If `s` is "15:20", then `h` is '15' and `m` is '20'. According to the conditions, `h1` is '03' (15 - 12) and `time` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **03:20 PM**

- If `s` is "00:15", then `h` is '00' and `m` is '15'. According to the conditions, `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:15 AM**

- If `s` is "24:00", then `h` is '24' and `m` is '00'. According to the conditions, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.
  - Output: **:00**

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
- **h1:m time** (where `h1` is the hour in 12-hour format and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions, or empty strings if `h` does not match any condition).

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions, or empty strings if h does not match any condition)**
