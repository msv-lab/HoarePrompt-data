The loop head includes the variable `_` and the range defined by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `_` must be incremented by 1, and the range must still be greater than the current value of `_`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm"
- `h` is the hour part of the input string
- `m` is the minute part of the input string
- `m1` is equal to `m`
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `_` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The range defined by `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Since the input for the range is not changing and is provided once at the start, we only need to adjust `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `_` is incremented by 1, `h1` and `time` remain as determined based on the value of `h`**
