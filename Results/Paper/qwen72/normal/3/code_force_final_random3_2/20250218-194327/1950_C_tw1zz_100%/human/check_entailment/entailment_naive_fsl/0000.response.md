Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is `12` and the time is in the AM. According to the problem description, `12:00 AM` should be `12:00 AM`, but the program will incorrectly output `12:00 PM` for `12:00`.

To fix this, the program should have a condition to handle the `12` hour case for both AM and PM correctly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = h
        time = ''
        if h == '00':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '12':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        elif int(h) < 12:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        else:
            h1 = str(int(h) - 12).zfill(2)
            time = 'PM'
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

This version correctly handles the `12` hour case for both AM and PM, and ensures that leading zeros are preserved.
