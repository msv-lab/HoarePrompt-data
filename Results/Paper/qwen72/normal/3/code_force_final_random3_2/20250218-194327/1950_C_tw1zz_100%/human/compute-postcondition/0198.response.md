Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04' to '11', `h1` is the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.***
