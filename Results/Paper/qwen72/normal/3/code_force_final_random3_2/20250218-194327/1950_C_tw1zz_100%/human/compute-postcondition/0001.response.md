Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
- The input string `s` is split by the colon `:` into two parts, which are assigned to `h` and `m` respectively.
- `h` now holds the hour part of the input string.
- `m` now holds the minute part of the input string.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 remains valid.
