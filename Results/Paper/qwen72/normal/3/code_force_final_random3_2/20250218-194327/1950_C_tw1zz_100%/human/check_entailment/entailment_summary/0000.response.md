Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads a time in 24-hour format. It then converts this time to 12-hour format and prints the result. The conversion logic is implemented using a series of `if-elif` statements, which correctly map each 24-hour format hour to its corresponding 12-hour format hour and AM/PM indicator.

However, the program has a few issues:
1. **Redundancy**: The `if-elif` statements for hours 01 to 11 and 13 to 23 are redundant. A more efficient way to handle this would be to use a single condition to check if the hour is in the AM or PM range and then convert it accordingly.
2. **Special Cases**: The program correctly handles the special cases for hours 00 and 12, which are the edge cases in the 24-hour to 12-hour conversion.

Despite these issues, the program will produce the correct output for the given problem description and input format. The redundancy does not affect the correctness of the output, but it does make the code less readable and maintainable.

Correctness: **True**
