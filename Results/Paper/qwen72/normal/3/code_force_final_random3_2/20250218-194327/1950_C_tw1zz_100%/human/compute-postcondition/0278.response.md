Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm". For each iteration, `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '01' to '11', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (from '01' to '11') and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is 'AM'. The loop will print the formatted time for each input string.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the initial variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged. For each input string provided during the loop, the hour part `h` is converted to a 12-hour format and stored in `h1`, while the minute part `m` is stored in `m1`. The variable `time` is set to 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part. The loop will print the formatted time for each input string, converting the 24-hour format to a 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM designation.
