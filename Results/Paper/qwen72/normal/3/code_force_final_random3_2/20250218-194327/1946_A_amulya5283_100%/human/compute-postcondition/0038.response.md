Postcondition: ***`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and is still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `res` is 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, otherwise `res` remains 0.***
