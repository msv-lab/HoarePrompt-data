Output State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an input integer minus 1, and `n` is an input integer. `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user.**
