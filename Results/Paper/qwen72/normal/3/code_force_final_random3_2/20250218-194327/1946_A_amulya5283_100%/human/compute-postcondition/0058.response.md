Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 2 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is 0, and if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1. After executing `res += 1`, the value of `res` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
