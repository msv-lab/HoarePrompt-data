Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new lists of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 0, `count_a` is 1 if `len_a` is greater than 1 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 1, and the current value of `b[i]` (which is `b[0]`) is less than or equal to `k`.**
