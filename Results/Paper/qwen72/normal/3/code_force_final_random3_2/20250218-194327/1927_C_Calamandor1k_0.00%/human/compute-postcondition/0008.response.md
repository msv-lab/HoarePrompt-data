The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `len_a`, and `len_b`. The loop will execute if `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute, at least one of the lists `a` or `b` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len_a` or `len_b` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is equal to `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `i` is 0**
