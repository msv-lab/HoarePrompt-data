The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `b` is a list of integers of length `m`, and `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * min(n, m). The lengths `n` and `m` are such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.
