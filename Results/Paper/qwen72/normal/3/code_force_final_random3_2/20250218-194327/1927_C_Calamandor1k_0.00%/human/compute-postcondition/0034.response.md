To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers provided by the user.
   - `len_a` is the length of list `a`.
   - `len_b` is the length of list `b`.
   - `d` is equal to `k` divided by 2 (integer division).
   - `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.
   - `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`.
   - `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output 'YES' if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.
   - Otherwise, it will output 'NO'.
   - `d` is calculated as `k // 2`, which means it is half of `k` (integer division).
   - `count_a` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`.
   - `count_b` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The exact values of `count_a` and `count_b` depend on the specific elements in the lists `a` and `b` and the value of `k`.
   - If both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`, the output will be 'YES'.
   - If either `count_a` or `count_b` is less than `d`, the output will be 'NO'.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the conditions given.

Output: **'YES' if the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1` is greater than or equal to `k // 2` and the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1` is also greater than or equal to `k // 2`; otherwise 'NO'**.
