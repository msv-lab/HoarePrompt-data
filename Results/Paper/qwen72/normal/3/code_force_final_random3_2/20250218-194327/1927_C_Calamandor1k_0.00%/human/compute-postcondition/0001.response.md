The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it does not have a specific state that needs to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
