Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of the new `a`, `len_b` is the length of the new `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 0, and the length of `a` (`len_a`) is greater than 1. If the first element of `a` (`a[0]`) is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 0. Otherwise, `count_a` and `count_b` remain 0.***
