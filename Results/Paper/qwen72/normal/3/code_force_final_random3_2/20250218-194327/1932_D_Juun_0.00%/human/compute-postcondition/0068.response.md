The only objects in the loop head are the variables `answer` and `answers`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `answers` list must still have at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` list must have at least one element, and `answer` was the last element in the list. For the loop to execute again, the `answers` list must still have at least one element, and `answer` will be the next element in the list, which is the first element of the remaining elements.

State: **`trumps` list is now empty, `answers` list must have at least one element, `answer` is the first element in the `answers` list, all other variables (`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `suits`) remain unchanged**
