Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to a non-`None` value. If `trumps` is not empty, `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, and now includes an additional string in the format 'rank suit trumps.pop() trump' if `rank` is not `None`. If `rank` was `None`, `suit` and `rank` are updated to the next key-value pair in `suits` where the value is non-`None`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.**
