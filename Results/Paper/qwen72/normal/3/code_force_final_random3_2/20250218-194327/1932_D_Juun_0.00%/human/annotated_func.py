#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), trump_suit (a character from "CDHS"), and cards (a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards from `user_input` whose suit matches `trump`, `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, with each rank followed by the suit. The `suits` dictionary has keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are set to `None`.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to a non-`None` value. The `trumps` list is empty, and `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, and each string is in the format 'rank suit trumps.pop() trump' for each non-None rank in `suits` that had a corresponding trump card. If `trumps` was empty before the loop finished, the program would have returned `None` and the loop would have terminated early.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is now empty, and all elements that were in `trumps` have been printed in pairs, each followed by the `trump` suit. The `answers` list remains unchanged, containing the strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, and each string is in the format 'rank suit trumps.pop() trump' for each non-None rank in `suits` that had a corresponding trump card. The values of `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `trump` remain unchanged, and the `suits` dictionary also remains unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is now empty, and all elements in the `answers` list have been printed. The `answers` list remains unchanged, and all other variables (`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `suits`) remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a set of card inputs provided by the user, where the cards are represented as a list of 2n unique two-character strings, with each string indicating a card's rank and suit. The function identifies and separates cards that match the specified trump suit from those that do not. It then pairs non-trump suit cards with the same suit and prints them in a sorted order. If there are any remaining trump cards after pairing, it prints them in pairs, sorted by rank. If at any point there are not enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, the function prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns `None`. Otherwise, the function does not return any value. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, or `cards`.
