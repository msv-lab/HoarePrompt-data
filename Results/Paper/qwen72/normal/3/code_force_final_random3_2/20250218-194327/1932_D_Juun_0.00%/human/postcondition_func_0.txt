The function `func_1` processes a set of card inputs provided by the user, where the cards are represented as a list of 2n unique two-character strings, with each string indicating a card's rank and suit. The function identifies and separates cards that match the specified trump suit from those that do not. It then pairs non-trump suit cards with the same suit and prints them in a sorted order. If there are any remaining trump cards after pairing, it prints them in pairs, sorted by rank. If at any point there are not enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, the function prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns `None`. Otherwise, the function does not return any value. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, or `cards`.
