Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `card` is the first element of the list returned by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card from `user_input`, and `answers` is an empty list. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, `trumps` is an empty list. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list containing one string, which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, each followed by `suit`, and the value of `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list, and the value of `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rank` is the first character of the second element of the list returned by `input().split()`, `suit` is the second character of the second element of the list returned by `input().split()`, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card from `user_input` if the suit of the first card was equal to `trump`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` also contains the `rank` of the second card from `user_input`. `answers` is a list containing one string if `suits[suit]` was not `None` and the suit of the first card was not equal to `trump`, otherwise `answers` is an empty list. `suits[suit]` is set to `None` if `suits[suit]` was not `None` and `suit` is not equal to `trump`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`card` is the third element of the list returned by `input().split()`, `input().split()` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where n is an integer and 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list that now includes the value of `rank`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that includes a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, separated by a space, and `suits[suit]` is `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
