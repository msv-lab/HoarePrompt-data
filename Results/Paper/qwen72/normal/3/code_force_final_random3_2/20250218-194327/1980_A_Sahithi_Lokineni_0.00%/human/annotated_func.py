#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers representing the number of problems of each difficulty level (A to G) and an integer m representing the number of rounds. However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0. It does not modify any external state or variables.
