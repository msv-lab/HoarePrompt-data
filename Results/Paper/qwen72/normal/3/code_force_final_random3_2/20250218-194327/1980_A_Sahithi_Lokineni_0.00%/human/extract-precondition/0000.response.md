Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers representing the number of problems of each difficulty level (A to G) and an integer m representing the number of rounds. However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def min_problems_needed(n, m, a):
```

**Where n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
