Output State: **The function takes two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` should have a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` should be an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.
- The code `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` modifies `v` by replacing the initial list of zeros with a new list where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are a list of integers provided by the user.
- The length of `v` remains `n + 1`, and the first element is still 0.
- The other elements of `v` are now the integers provided by the user, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- The values of `p` and `n` remain unchanged.
