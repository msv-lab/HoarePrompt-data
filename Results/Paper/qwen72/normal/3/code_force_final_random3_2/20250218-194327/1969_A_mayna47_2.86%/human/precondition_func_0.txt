The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` should have a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` should be an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` should be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
