Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to correctly determine the minimum number of invitations required in certain scenarios. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
The correct output should be `3`, because Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. For example, sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 attend the party.

However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly identifies a case where `v[v[v[i]]] == i` and assumes that only 2 invitations are needed. This is not always correct, as shown by the counterexample. The program should consider more complex cases where the friends' best friend relationships form longer chains or cycles.
