The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that prints the integer value `2`.

Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50.
- `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2.

The `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
