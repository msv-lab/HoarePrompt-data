Postcondition: **The function takes two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` has a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the current value of `n` is 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as a list of integers provided by the user.**
