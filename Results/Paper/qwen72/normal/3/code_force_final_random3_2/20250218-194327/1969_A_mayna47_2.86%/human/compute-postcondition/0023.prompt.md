You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` should have a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` should be an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` should be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop has completed all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each `i` in this range, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. The program has not printed anything and has not returned.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: If `n` is 2, the function takes two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` has a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the current value of `n` is 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as a list of integers provided by the user. If `n` is not 2, the loop has completed all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n`, and for each `i` in this range, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. The program has not printed anything and has not returned.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: a list of integers `p` and an integer `n`. The list `p` represents the best friends of each friend, and `n` represents the number of friends. The function returns `None` in all cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
