Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` does not take any parameters, which is a mismatch with the problem description that suggests it should take `n` and `p` as parameters.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads `n` (the number of friends) and initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends `p` and updates `v` starting from index 1.
   - If `n` is 2, it prints 2 and returns, which is correct because in this case, Monocarp needs to invite both friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - For `n > 2`, it checks if there exists a friend `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition checks if there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships. If such a cycle exists, it prints 2 and returns, which is correct because inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure both come to the party.
   - If no such cycle is found, it prints 3 and returns. This is incorrect because the program should find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, not just a fixed number of 3.

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the minimum number of invitations required is more than 2 but less than 3. For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 4 or more, the program will incorrectly print 3 instead of the correct minimum number of invitations.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to find the minimum number of invitations required when the best friend relationships form cycles of length greater than 3.

Correctness: **False**
