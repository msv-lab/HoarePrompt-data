Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `y` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Values:**
   - `x` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99.
   - `y` is 0, but it is not used in the code snippet.

2. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression `x / 15` will compute the division of `x` by 15.
   - Since `x` is a non-negative integer and \(0 < x \leq 99\), the result of `x / 15` will be a floating-point number between \(0\) and \(6.6\) (inclusive).

3. **Ceiling Function:**
   - The `math.ceil` function will round up the result of `x / 15` to the nearest integer.
   - The possible values for `math.ceil(x / 15)` are:
     - 1 if \(0 < x \leq 15\)
     - 2 if \(15 < x \leq 30\)
     - 3 if \(30 < x \leq 45\)
     - 4 if \(45 < x \leq 60\)
     - 5 if \(60 < x \leq 75\)
     - 6 if \(75 < x \leq 90\)
     - 7 if \(90 < x \leq 99\)

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15, which is an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive).

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, and the result is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive)**
