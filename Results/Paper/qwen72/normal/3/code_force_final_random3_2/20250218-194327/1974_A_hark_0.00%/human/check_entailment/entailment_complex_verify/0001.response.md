### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens required to fit all the icons.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function returns the minimum of two values. However, it is not used in the main logic, so it can be ignored.
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function processes a single test case.
     - It reads the values of `x` and `y` from the input.
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - It calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - It then calculates the remaining cells needed for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done by subtracting the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons from the total number of cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
       - If there are still cells needed for 1x1 icons, it calculates the additional screens required using `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
       - Finally, it prints the total number of screens required.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - It prints the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - It prints the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons, which is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - It prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens for 1x1 icons is also correct: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - The combined logic for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons is more complex:
     - The code subtracts the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons from the total number of cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons. However, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 15.
     - The line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect. It should be `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` because there is no need to add 1 extra screen.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - The corrected line should be:
     ```python
     x = x - bxsfory * 4
     ```
   - The corrected line for additional screens should be:
     ```python
     bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
     ```

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original code has a logical error in the calculation of the remaining cells for 1x1 icons and the additional screens required.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
