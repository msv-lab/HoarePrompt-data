The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, the output is based on the values of `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. Since the function does not take any parameters, the values of `x` and `y` must be defined within the function or are static. The function returns a result based on these predefined values of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a result based on predefined non-negative integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
