You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This line attempts to adjust the number of 1x1 icons by subtracting the number of 1x1 icon slots that are occupied by 2x2 icons, but it does so in a way that does not accurately reflect the actual space used.

### Problem with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Adjustment for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is supposed to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this adjustment is incorrect because:
     - `bxsfory * 15` is the total number of 1x1 icon slots that could be occupied by 2x2 icons if each 2x2 icon were placed in a new screen.
     - `y * 4` is the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
     - The correct adjustment should be `x = x - (bxsfory * 11)`, where `11` is the number of 1x1 icon slots left after placing one 2x2 icon in a screen (since a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 15 - 4 = 11 cells for 1x1 icons).

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  12 4
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  The program will output `2`, but the logic is flawed. If we place 4 2x2 icons, we need 2 screens (since each screen can hold 2 2x2 icons). After placing the 2x2 icons, we have 12 - (2 * 11) = 12 - 22 = -10, which is incorrect. The program should correctly handle the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
import math

def func_2(x, y):
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 11  # Correct adjustment for 1x1 icons
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        func_2(x, y)

func_3()
```

This corrected code should handle all potential cases correctly.
