The only objects in the loop head are the placeholder `_` and the variable `t`. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to adjust `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. However, since the loop has already executed once, the value of `t` should be considered as one less than it was at the start of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
