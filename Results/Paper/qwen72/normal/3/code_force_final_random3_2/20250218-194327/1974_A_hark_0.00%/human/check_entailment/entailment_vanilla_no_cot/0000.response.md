Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens needed for the 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of screens required for both types of icons is flawed. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 9` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining 1x1 icons should be adjusted accordingly. The `15` in the formula is incorrect because it does not account for the actual number of cells a 2x2 icon occupies.

2. **Incorrect Adjustment for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect. The `+ 1` is unnecessary and can lead to an overestimation of the number of screens needed. It should be `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`.

3. **Handling Cases with Both 1x1 and 2x2 Icons**:
   - The logic for handling cases where both 1x1 and 2x2 icons are present is not optimal. The program should first place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens and then place the remaining 1x1 icons, ensuring the minimum number of screens is used.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def min_screens(x, y):
    # Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns)
    screen_capacity = 15
    
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    
    # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
    remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * screen_capacity - y * 4
    
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
    screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / screen_capacity)
    
    # If there are remaining cells on the screens with 2x2 icons, use them for 1x1 icons
    if remaining_cells > 0:
        x -= min(x, remaining_cells)
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / screen_capacity)
    
    # Total screens needed
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
    
    return total_screens

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_screens(x, y))

# Call the main function
func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum number of screens is used by first placing the 2x2 icons and then using the remaining cells for 1x1 icons. It correctly handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.
