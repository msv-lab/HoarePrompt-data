Postcondition: ***x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < y <= 99, `bxsfory` is equal to `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the current value of `x` is 0, and the current value of `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0.***
