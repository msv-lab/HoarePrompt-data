The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraint provided is that `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is not an input to the function, it is likely a global variable or a constant used within the function. The function returns a value based on the value of `t`.

Given the constraints and the lack of input parameters, the function's output can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on a non-negative integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
