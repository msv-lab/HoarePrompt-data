You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory is math.ceil(y / 2) and bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise math.ceil(x / 15) + 1)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: (y + 1) // 2 (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, and the result is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: *x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and x, y are assigned the values from the input. If x > 0 and y == 0, then x is greater than 0 and y is 0. Otherwise, either x is 0, or y is not 0.
        #State: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and x, y are assigned the values from the input. If x is 0 and y is greater than 0, the current value of x is 0, and the current value of y is greater than 0. If x is greater than 0 and y is 0, then x is greater than 0 and y is 0. Otherwise, either x is 0, or y is not 0.
    #State: *x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < y <= 99, `bxsfory` is equal to `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the current value of `x` is 0, and the current value of `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a result based on predefined non-negative integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 99.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
