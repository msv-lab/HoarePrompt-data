The code snippet provided is simply `print(0)`. This statement will print the integer value 0, regardless of the values of `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- Either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0.

These conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement, as the statement is explicitly printing the integer 0.

Output: **0**
