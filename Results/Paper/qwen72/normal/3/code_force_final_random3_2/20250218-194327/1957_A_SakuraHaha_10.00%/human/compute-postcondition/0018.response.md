Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This variable is not directly used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it for now.
2. `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). This represents the length of the list `a`.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). This means `a` contains `n` integers, each between 1 and 100.
4. `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
5. `ans` is the sum of \(x // 4\) for all values `x` in `cnt.values()`. This means `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each count in the dictionary `cnt` by 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **List `a`**: This list contains `n` integers, each between 1 and 100.
2. **Dictionary `cnt`**: This dictionary will have keys that are the unique integers in `a` and values that are the counts of these integers in `a`.
3. **Variable `ans`**: This variable is calculated by summing the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 4. 

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
- The dictionary `cnt` will be:
  ```python
  cnt = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 5}
  ```
- The values in `cnt` are `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.
- The integer division of each value by 4 is:
  - \(1 // 4 = 0\)
  - \(2 // 4 = 0\)
  - \(4 // 4 = 1\)
  - \(5 // 4 = 1\)
- The sum of these values is \(0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2\).

### General Case:
- The value of `ans` will be the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 4.
- Since the counts are the values in `cnt`, and each count is an integer between 1 and 100, the integer division \(x // 4\) will be 0 if \(x < 4\), 1 if \(4 \leq x < 8\), 2 if \(8 \leq x < 12\), and so on.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the integer division of each count in the dictionary `cnt` by 4.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of \(x // 4\) for all values \(x\) in `cnt.values()`, and `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`)**
