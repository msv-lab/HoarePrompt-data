Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is increased by `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += x // 4` increments the value of `ans` by the integer division of `x` by 4.
- The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is increased by `x // 4`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged and retain their initial state properties.
