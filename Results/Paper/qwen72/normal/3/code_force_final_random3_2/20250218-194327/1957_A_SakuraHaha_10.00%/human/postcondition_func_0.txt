The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input. It then calculates the number of groups of four sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length in the list `a` and prints this number. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result of the calculation for the current test case. The function is designed to be called multiple times, once for each test case, but the handling of multiple test cases is not shown in the provided code.
