The function `func_1` does not explicitly define parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is expected to handle a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. The function should return a result for each test case.

However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, it is likely that the function is designed to read input from a source (like standard input) or is part of a larger program where the input is provided in a specific context. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.

The function should return a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Assuming the function is designed to determine some property of the sticks (like whether they can form a certain shape), the return value would depend on the logic implemented within the function.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided output description.**
