Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `cnt` by 4. The dictionary `cnt` remains unchanged, and the variables `t` and `n` also remain unchanged. The list `a` also remains unchanged.
