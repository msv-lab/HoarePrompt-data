#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of \(x // 4\) for all values \(x\) in `cnt.values()`, and `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input. It then calculates the number of groups of four sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length in the list `a` and prints this number. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result of the calculation for the current test case. The function is designed to be called multiple times, once for each test case, but the handling of multiple test cases is not shown in the provided code.
