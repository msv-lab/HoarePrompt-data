To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `k` and `n`, and the variable `j` is used in the range calculation.
2. **Initial state**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is `n - 2`.
   - `count` is 0.

3. **Loop condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(0, n - j)` is non-empty. Since `j` is 1, the range will be `range(0, n - 1)`. For this range to be non-empty, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `k` in the loop head is being reassigned to iterate over the range `range(0, n - 1)`. Therefore, the initial value of `k` (which is `n - 2`) is not relevant to the loop execution and does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, which is already given in the initial state.
   - The variable `j` is 1, which is also already given and does not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the only necessary adjustments are to ensure that the loop can execute based on the provided conditions. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, and `k` will start from 0 and iterate up to `n - 2`.

State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `k` is 0; `count` is 0**
