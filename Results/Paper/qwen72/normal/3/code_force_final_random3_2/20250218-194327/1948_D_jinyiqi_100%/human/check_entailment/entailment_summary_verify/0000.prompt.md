You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with the length of `s` between 1 and 5000 inclusive. It checks for the presence of consecutive pairs of characters in `s` that either contain a question mark or are equal. If such a sequence of pairs is found where the length of the sequence is at least half the length of `s`, the function prints the length of the sequence multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such sequence is found, the function prints 0 and returns. The function does not return any value explicitly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string is a tandem repeat but contains no question marks. For example, for the input string "abab", the program will print 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 4, as "abab" is a tandem repeat of length 4. 

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the string can be modified to form a longer tandem repeat. For instance, for the input string "a?b?a?b", the program will print 2, but the correct output should be 6, as the string can be modified to "aabbab" or "ababab", both of which are tandem repeats of length 6.
