You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as an argument, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), which is not shown in the function definition provided.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `k` is `n - 2`. If the loop has found a sequence of `j` consecutive pairs of characters where each pair either contains a question mark or the characters in the pair are equal, then `count` is `j` and the program has printed `j * 2` and returned. Otherwise, `count` is less than `j` and the program has not printed anything or returned.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: - The `print(0)` statement will print the integer 0.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with the length of `s` between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The function returns a value of `count` which is 1 if any of the following conditions are met for a character at position `k` and its corresponding character at position `k + j` (where `j` is half the length of `s`): `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. If none of these conditions are met, `count` is 0 and the function returns 0. The function does not return anything in other cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of `count`, which is equal to `j`. `j` is half the length of the list `s`, and `count` is set to 1 if `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: The program returns nothing.

Case_4: The program returns the current value of `count`, which is 0.

Case_5: The program returns nothing.

Case_6: The program returns nothing.

Case_7: The program returns nothing.

Case_8: The program returns nothing.

Case_9: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
