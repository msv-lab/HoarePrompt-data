The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was initially 1 or 0 based on the conditions, it is now 2 or 1, respectively. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 0; `k` is 1; If `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1 and `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.**
