#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as an argument, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), which is not shown in the function definition provided.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `k` is `n - 2`. If the loop has found a sequence of `j` consecutive pairs of characters where each pair either contains a question mark or the characters in the pair are equal, then `count` is `j` and the program has printed `j * 2` and returned. Otherwise, `count` is less than `j` and the program has not printed anything or returned.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: - The `print(0)` statement will print the integer 0.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with the length of `s` between 1 and 5000 inclusive. It checks for the presence of consecutive pairs of characters in `s` that either contain a question mark or are equal. If such a sequence of pairs is found where the length of the sequence is at least half the length of `s`, the function prints the length of the sequence multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such sequence is found, the function prints 0 and returns. The function does not return any value explicitly.
