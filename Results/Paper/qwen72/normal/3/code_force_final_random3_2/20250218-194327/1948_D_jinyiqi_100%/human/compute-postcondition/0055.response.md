Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 0; `k` is `n - j - 1`. If `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is the number of consecutive iterations where this condition was true. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `s` remains unchanged, containing characters from the input string, which can be lowercase Latin letters or question marks.
- The variable `n` is still the length of the list `s`, and `s` must have at least 2 elements.
- The variable `j` is still 0.
- The variable `k` has reached the last valid index for the loop, which is `n - j - 1`.
- The variable `count` will be the number of consecutive iterations where the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` was true. If this condition was never true, `count` will be 0.
- The program has not printed anything or returned, meaning that `count` was never equal to `j` during the loop execution.
