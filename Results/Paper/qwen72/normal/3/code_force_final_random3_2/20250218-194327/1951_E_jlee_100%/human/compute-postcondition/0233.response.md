Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged.***
