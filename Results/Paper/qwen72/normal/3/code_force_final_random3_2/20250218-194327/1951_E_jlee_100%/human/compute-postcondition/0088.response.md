Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is 1, `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
