Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided to determine what will be printed by the `print(1)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is a variable whose value is not explicitly given.
- `count2` is a variable whose value is not explicitly given.
- `done` is a boolean variable whose value is not explicitly given.

### Conditions:
1. If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is True.
2. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is True.
3. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains unchanged.
4. If `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, `done` is True.
5. If `count2 == count` and `count <= 1`, `count2` is 0, `count` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged.
6. If `count2 > count`, `done` is True.

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement is a simple print statement that prints the integer `1`.
- The conditions provided do not affect the value being printed by the `print(1)` statement.
- The conditions only modify the values of `count`, `count2`, and `done` based on the values of `s[j]` and `x`.

Since the `print(1)` statement is independent of the conditions and variables described in the initial state, it will always print the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
