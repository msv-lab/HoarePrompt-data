Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `done` remains False, `count` is greater than 0, and the current character `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count` is less than or equal to 1.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not change any variable values, the initial state remains unchanged.
