You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `t`, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is a list of characters from the last input string `string`, `string` is the last input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`), `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if `count` is 0), and `done` is False if none of the conditions for a 'YES' output were met in the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` and a list of `t` strings from the user. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` strings, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string can be partitioned into more than two non-palindromic substrings correctly. For example, consider the input string "abacaba". The program will output "NO" for this string, but it is possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings such as "aba" and "caba" or "abac" and "aba". The program fails to explore all possible partitions and only checks for the simplest cases, leading to incorrect results for some valid inputs.
