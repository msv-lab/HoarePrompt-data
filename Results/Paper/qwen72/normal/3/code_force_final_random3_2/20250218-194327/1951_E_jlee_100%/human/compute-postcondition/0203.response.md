Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
   - `string` is the new input string.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `string[:j - 1]` is equivalent to `string[:0 - 1]`, which is `string[-1]`. This will give the last character of the string `string`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` is equivalent to `string[0 - 1:]`, which is `string[-1:]`. This will give the last character of the string `string` and everything after it (which is just the last character).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `j` is 0, `string[:j - 1]` will be the last character of `string`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will also be the last character of `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the last character of `string` twice.

Output: **last character of string, last character of string**
