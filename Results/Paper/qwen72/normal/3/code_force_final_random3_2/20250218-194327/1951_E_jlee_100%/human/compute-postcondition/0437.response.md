Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`), `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if `count` is 0), and `done` is False.**
