Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, which must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False.
- Otherwise, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, and it is given that `n > 1`.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`, so `x = s[0]`.
   - `j` is initialized to 1.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `if s[j] != x and count < 1` is checked.
     - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
     - However, since `count` is already greater than 0, this condition will not change `count`.

3. **Palindrome Check**:
   - The condition `if s[j] == s[n - 1 - j]` is checked.
     - If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False.
     - Otherwise, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` is executed.
   - `j` is 1, so `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from the second character to the end.

### Final Output:
- The first character of `string` will be printed followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
