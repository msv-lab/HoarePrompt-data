Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
4. `string` is the new input string.
5. `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1.
6. `x` is the first character of `s`.
7. `j` is 1.
8. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`**:
   - This means `s` is a list where each element is a character from `string`.

2. **`n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1**:
   - This implies that `string` has at least 2 characters.

3. **`x` is the first character of `s`**:
   - `x` is the first character of `string`.

4. **`j` is 1**:
   - `j` is set to 1, which is the index of the second character in `string`.

5. **If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged**:
   - This condition is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, but it affects the state of the variables `count`, `count2`, and `done`.

6. **`print(string[:j], string[j:])`**:
   - `string[:j]` will print the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j`.
   - `string[j:]` will print the substring of `string` from the character at index `j` to the end.

Given that `j` is 1:
- `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
- `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of string starting from the second character]**
