Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `done` is True, `count` is unchanged, `count2` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
