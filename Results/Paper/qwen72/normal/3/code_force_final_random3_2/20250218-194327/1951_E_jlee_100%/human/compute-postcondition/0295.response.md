Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (if such a character exists and `count` was not set to a value greater than 0 in a previous iteration), `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` (if `count` was set to a value greater than 0 in a previous iteration), and `done` is False if the loop has not detected a condition that leads to a 'YES' output. If `done` was already True, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
