Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is equal to `count`, `j` is 0, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 1, and the current character `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
