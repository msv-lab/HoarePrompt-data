Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `count2` is 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is less than `count`.
- If `count` is less than 1, `done` is False; otherwise, the state of `done` remains unchanged.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
