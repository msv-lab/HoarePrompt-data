Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program attempts to solve the problem but has several logical issues that can lead to incorrect results. Here are the main problems:

1. **Single Character String Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string has only one character and prints "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome.

2. **String with All Characters the Same**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all characters in the string are the same and prints "NO" because any substring of such a string is a palindrome.

3. **String with One Different Character**:
   - The program attempts to handle the case where all but one character are the same. However, it has a logical error in the condition `if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "abaaa" should be partitioned into "ab" and "aaa" or "aba" and "aa", but the program incorrectly prints "NO".

4. **General Case**:
   - The program has a complex and incorrect logic for handling the general case. It attempts to find a non-palindromic partition by checking if there are any characters that are different from the first and last characters. However, the logic for determining the partition is flawed and can lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:

A simpler and more reliable approach to solve this problem is as follows:

1. **Single Character String**:
   - If the string has only one character, print "NO".

2. **All Characters the Same**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same, print "NO".

3. **General Case**:
   - If the string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, it is always possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. One simple way to do this is to partition the string into two parts: the first part containing the first character and the second part containing the rest of the string. If the first character is the same as the last character, partition the string into the first two characters and the rest.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if string == string[::-1]:
            if n == 2:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[0], string[1])
            else:
                print('NO')
            continue
        
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(string[0], string[1:])

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Single Character String**:
   - If the string has only one character, it prints "NO".

2. **Palindrome Check**:
   - If the string is a palindrome, it checks the length:
     - If the length is 2, it can be partitioned into two single characters, which are non-palindromic.
     - If the length is greater than 2, it prints "NO" because any partition will contain a palindrome.

3. **Non-Palindromic String**:
   - If the string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into the first character and the rest of the string. This ensures that at least one part is non-palindromic.

This approach is simpler and more reliable, ensuring that the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem.
