Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is `x-1`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the loop finds an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations, and `flag` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[j] - 1] == l[j] - 1` was met for any `j` in the range `[0, x-1]`, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged. If the condition was met, the loop breaks and prints 2. If the condition was never met, the loop completes and prints 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is `x-1`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is unchanged or True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met at any iteration. If the condition was met, the loop prints 2 and breaks. If the condition was never met, the loop prints 3 after completing all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
