You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met at any iteration. If the condition was met, the loop prints 2 and breaks. If the condition was never met, the loop prints 3 after completing all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Monocarp has `n` friends, and each friend has a best friend.
   - A friend will come to the party only if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Input/Output Format**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has two lines: the number of friends `n` and a list `p` of length `n` where `p[i]` is the best friend of friend `i`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list `l` of best friends.
   - It then iterates through the list `l` to check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` in such cases.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where there is no such pair. It always prints `3` in this case, which is not always the correct answer.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     2 1 4 3
     ```
   - The program will print `3`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here, friends 1 and 2 are best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are best friends. Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 3, and both pairs will come to the party.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it fails to find the minimum number of invitations required when there are no direct pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.

### Correctness:
**False**
