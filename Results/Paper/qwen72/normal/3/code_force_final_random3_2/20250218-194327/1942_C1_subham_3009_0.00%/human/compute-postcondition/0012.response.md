The code snippet `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers and reassigns the result to `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements converted from the original list of strings.**
