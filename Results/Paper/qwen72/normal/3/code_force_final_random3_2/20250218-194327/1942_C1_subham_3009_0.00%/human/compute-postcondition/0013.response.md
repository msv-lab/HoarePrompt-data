Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 2.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `x` is the second input integer.
- `y` is the third input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements converted from the original list of strings.

The print statement is:
```
print(x - 2)
```

Explanation:
- The variable `x` is the second input integer.
- The print statement will output the value of `x - 2`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second input integer)**
