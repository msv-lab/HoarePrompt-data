Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `x` is the second input integer.
   - `y` is the third input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of the first `x` integers converted from the original list of strings.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(x - 2)` will print the value of `x` minus 2.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The value of `x` is provided as the second input integer.
   - The expression `x - 2` will subtract 2 from the value of `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second input integer)**
