Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 3, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of strings containing the elements from the fourth input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The initial state mentions that `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements converted from the original list of strings. After executing the code, `arr` is now a list of strings containing the elements from the fourth input. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
