The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of the number of sides `n` of a regular polygon, the number of vertices `x` chosen by Bessie, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function prints the value `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. If the script is not executed as the main module, no changes are made to the variables.
