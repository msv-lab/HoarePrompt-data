Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.
   - `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`.
   - `idx` is `1 + (t * (n + 1))`.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, where `n` and `a` are updated according to the input data for each iteration.
   - `result` is the third element in the `results` list.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `input` is a function that reads from `sys.stdin`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.
   - `idx` is calculated as `1 + (t * (n + 1))`. Given `t` is 0, `idx` simplifies to `1 + (0 * (n + 1)) = 1`.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `results` is a list with at least 3 elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a)` with `n` and `a` updated for each iteration.
   - `result` is the third element in the `results` list.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the third element in the `results` list.
   - Since `results` is a list of results from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, and `result` is the third element in this list, the output will be the result of the third call to `func_1(n, a)`.

Given the initial state and the provided information, the output will be the third element in the `results` list, which is the result of the third call to `func_1(n, a)`.

Output: **result (where result is the third element in the `results` list, which is the result of the third call to `func_1(n, a)`)**
