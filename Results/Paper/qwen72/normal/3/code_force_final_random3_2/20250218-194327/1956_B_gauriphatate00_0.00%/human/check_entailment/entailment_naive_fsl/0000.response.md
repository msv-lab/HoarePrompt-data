Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the described card game. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs of cards you have by summing up the number of integers that appear exactly twice.
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score points for up to `n // 2` pairs, as Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the maximum number of points you can get for that test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

The logic in `func_1` ensures that you are maximizing your score by considering the pairs of cards you have, and the logic in `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The program does not have any obvious edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
