Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in the player's hand.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs of cards (i.e., cards with the same number) in the player's hand.
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is because the player can only score a point for a card if there is already a matching card on the table, and the maximum number of pairs that can be used to score points is `n // 2` (since there are `n` turns and each turn uses one card).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes the input data for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the value of `n` and the list of cards `a` in the player's hand.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the maximum number of points the player can score for each test case and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points the player can score by considering the pairs of cards and the optimal play strategy. The logic in `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and processes the input data efficiently.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
