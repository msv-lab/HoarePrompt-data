Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[3 + 2 * n + 1]` to `data[3 + 4 * n - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `n` to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `idx` was initially `3 + 2 * n`. After the code execution, `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`, so the new `idx` is `3 + 2 * (integer value of data[3 + 2 * n])`.
- The list `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[3 + 2 * n + 1]` to `data[3 + 4 * n - 1]`, where `n` is the new integer value.
- The states of `input`, `data`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.
