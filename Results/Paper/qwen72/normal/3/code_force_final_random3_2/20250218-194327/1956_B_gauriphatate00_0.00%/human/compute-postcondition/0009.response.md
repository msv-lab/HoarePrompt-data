Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- `a` is assigned the value of a list of integers converted from the slice of `data` starting at index `idx` (which is 2) and ending at `idx + n` (exclusive).
- The value of `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- The slice `data[idx:idx + n]` will include `n` elements starting from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`.
- The other variables (`input`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
