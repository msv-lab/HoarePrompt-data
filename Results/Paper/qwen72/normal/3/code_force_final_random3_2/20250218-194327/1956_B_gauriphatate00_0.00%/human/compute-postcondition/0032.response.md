The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly in its function signature. Instead, it reads input from stdin. The input is expected to start with an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards, followed by a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards. The function processes this input and returns the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, and returns the result for each test case.**
