The only objects in the loop head are the variables `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` has more than one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element, and `result` is the first element in the `results` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and `result` will be the second element in the `results` list.

State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `1 + (t * (n + 1))`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, where `n` and `a` are updated according to the input data for each iteration, `result` is the second element in the `results` list**
