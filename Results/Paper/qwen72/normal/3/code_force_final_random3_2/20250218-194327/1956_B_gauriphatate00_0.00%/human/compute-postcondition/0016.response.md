Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[3 + n]` to `data[3 + 2 * n - 1]`**

Explanation:
- `idx` was initially `3 + n`. After the code `idx += n` is executed, `idx` becomes `3 + 2 * n`.
- The other variables (`input`, `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged, so their initial states are still valid.
- The specific value of `n` and the elements of `a` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain as described in the initial state.
