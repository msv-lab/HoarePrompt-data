Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `4 + 2 * n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[3 + 2 * n + 1]` to `data[3 + 4 * n - 1]`, `a` is updated to a list of `n` integers starting from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` updates the list `a` to contain `n` integers starting from the index `idx` in the `data` list and continuing for `n` elements.
- The value of `idx` is `4 + 2 * n`, which is used to slice the `data` list.
- The previous values of `input`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and the initial `a` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The updated `a` now contains the integers from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]`.
