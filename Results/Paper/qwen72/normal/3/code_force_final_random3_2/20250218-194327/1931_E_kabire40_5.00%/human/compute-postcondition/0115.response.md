Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string and must have at least two elements, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`.
- The value of `rev_val` is updated to include the reversed string of `x`.
- The other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x_rev`, and `rev_res`) remain unchanged.
- Since the initial state specifies that if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string, this condition is still valid after the code execution.
