Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least one element. `x` is an integer and `x % 2 != 0`. `val_in` is the element at index `x` in the `rev_val` list.**
