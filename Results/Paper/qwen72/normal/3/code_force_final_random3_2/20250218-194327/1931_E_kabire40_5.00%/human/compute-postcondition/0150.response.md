Output State: **`y` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` is the total number of test cases `t`, `list_len` is the first part of the input string for the last test case, `max_power` is the second part of the input string for the last test case, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string for the last test case, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the processed elements from `rev_val` according to the loop's rules. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`, the output is 'Sasha'. Otherwise, the output is 'Anna'.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `int(input())` times, where `int(input())` is the total number of test cases `t`.
- For each iteration, `y` is incremented from 0 to `t - 1`.
- In the last iteration, `y` is `t - 1`.
- The variables `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` are set based on the input for the last test case.
- The `rev_val` list is populated with the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and then sorted.
- The `rev_res` string is constructed by concatenating elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the even-indexed elements from `rev_val` in their integer form and the odd-indexed elements in their reversed string form.
- Finally, the loop checks if the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`. If it is, the output is 'Sasha'. Otherwise, the output is 'Anna'.
