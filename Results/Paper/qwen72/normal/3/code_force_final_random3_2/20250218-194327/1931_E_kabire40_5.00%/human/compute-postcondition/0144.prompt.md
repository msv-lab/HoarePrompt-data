Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least one element, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, `x` is 0. If `x` is divisible by 2, `rev_res` is now a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the integer value of the first element in `rev_val`. If `x` is not divisible by 2, `rev_res` is now the original `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed string of the first element of `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least one element, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string plus the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is the second element of `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is updated by appending the reversed string of `val_in`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `rev_val` must have at least two elements, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index 2 in `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is the third element in `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed string of `val_in`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
