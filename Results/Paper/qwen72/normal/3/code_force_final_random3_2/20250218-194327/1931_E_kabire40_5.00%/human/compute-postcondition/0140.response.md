Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `rev_val` must have at least two elements, `x` is 2, `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index 2 in `rev_val`, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of `val_in`.**
