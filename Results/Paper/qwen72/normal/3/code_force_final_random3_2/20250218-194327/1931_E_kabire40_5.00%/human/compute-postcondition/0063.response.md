Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` must have at least two string elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the second element of `operational_list`, `rev_res` is the second element of `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer.
- The value of `x_rev` is now the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`.
- The conditions for `rev_res` and `rev_val` remain the same as they depend on the length comparison of `x_rev` and `x`, which is not affected by this code snippet.
- All other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`) retain their initial values and conditions.
