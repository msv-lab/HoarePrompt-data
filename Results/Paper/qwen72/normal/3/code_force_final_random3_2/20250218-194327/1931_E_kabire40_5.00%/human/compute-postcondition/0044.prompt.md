Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated to include the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated to include the reversed string of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. In both cases, `rev_val` remains a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` must have at least two elements, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string plus the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the reversed form of the second element of `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` must have at least three elements, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[2]`, and `rev_res` is updated to include the original value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is not even, `val_in` is the third element of `rev_val` (index 2), and `rev_res` is updated by appending the reversed `val_in`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
