Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, `x` is an even integer, `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.**
