You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers in the list, an integer `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6) determining the winning condition, and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `y` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` is the total number of test cases `t`, `list_len` is the first part of the input string for the last test case, `max_power` is the second part of the input string for the last test case, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string for the last test case, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the processed elements from `rev_val` according to the loop's rules. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`, the output is 'Sasha'. Otherwise, the output is 'Anna'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `list_len` and `max_power` from the input.
   - It then reads a list of integers `operational_list` from the input.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program reverses the digits of each integer in `operational_list` and checks if the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original integer.
   - If the lengths are the same, it appends the original integer to `rev_res`.
   - If the lengths are different, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts the `rev_val` list.
   - It then concatenates the elements of `rev_val` to `rev_res` in a specific order: for even indices, it appends the integer as is, and for odd indices, it appends the integer in reverse order.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the concatenated result `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `10^max_power`.
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Reversing Digits:**
  - The program correctly reverses the digits of each integer and checks the length.
  - However, the logic for appending to `rev_res` and `rev_val` is flawed. It should append the reversed integer to `rev_res` if the length is the same, and to `rev_val` if the length is different. The current logic does the opposite.

- **Sorting and Concatenation:**
  - The program sorts `rev_val` and concatenates the elements in a specific order.
  - The logic for concatenation is incorrect. It should always append the reversed integer to `rev_res` to ensure the maximum possible number is formed.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The program correctly checks if the concatenated result is greater than or equal to `10^max_power`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = map(int, input().split())
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            rev_res += str(x_rev)
        if 10 ** max_power <= int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Reversing Digits:**
  - The program reverses the digits of each integer and appends the reversed integer to `rev_res` directly. This ensures that the maximum possible number is formed.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The program checks if the concatenated result `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `10^max_power`.

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in how it handles the reversed integers and their concatenation. The corrected program ensures that the maximum possible number is formed by always appending the reversed integers to `rev_res`.

### Correctness:
**False** (The original program is incorrect.)
