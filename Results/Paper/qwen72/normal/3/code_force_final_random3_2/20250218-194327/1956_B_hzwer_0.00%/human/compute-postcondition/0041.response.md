Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 2`, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- Since `i` is -1 and `j` is `n - 2`, `dp[-1][n - 2]` is now equal to `dp[0][n - 2]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
