The loop head contains the variable `j` and the list `cases` is not directly involved in the loop head, so we do not need to adjust it. The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, making it `n - 3`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 3`**
