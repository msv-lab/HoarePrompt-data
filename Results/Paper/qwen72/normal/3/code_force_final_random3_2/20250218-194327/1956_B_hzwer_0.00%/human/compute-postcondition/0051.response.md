Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 3`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Otherwise, if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[-1][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[0][n - 3]` and `dp[1][n - 4] + 1`. If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, `dp[-1][n - 3]` is set to 1.***
