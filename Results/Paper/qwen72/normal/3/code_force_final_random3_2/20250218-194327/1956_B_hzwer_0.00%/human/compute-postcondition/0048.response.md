Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop and `dp[-1][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[0][n - 3]` and `dp[1][n - 4] + 1`, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- Given `i` is -1 and `j` is `n - 3`, `dp[-1][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[0][n - 3]` and `dp[1][n - 4] + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain -1 and `n - 3`, respectively.
