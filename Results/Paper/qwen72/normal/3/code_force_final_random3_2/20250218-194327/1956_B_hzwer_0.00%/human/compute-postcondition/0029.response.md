To determine the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cases` is a list of tuples.
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop.
- `i` is `0`.
- `j` is `0`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(n - 3, -1, -1)`. This means `i` starts at `n - 3` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1` (exclusive).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `-1` at the start of the next iteration.
4. **Loop Termination**: Since the loop condition is `i` in `range(n - 3, -1, -1)`, when `i` becomes `-1`, the loop will terminate.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `-1`.
- `n` must be at least 3 (unchanged).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`.**
