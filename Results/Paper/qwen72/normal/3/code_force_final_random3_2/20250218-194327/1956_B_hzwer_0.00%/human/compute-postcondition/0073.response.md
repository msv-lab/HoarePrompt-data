Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is n - 3, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- The variables `t`, `cases`, `n`, `cards`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values or conditions, with the exception of `dp[i][j]` which is now updated.
- The specific indices `i` and `j` are `n - 4` and `n - 3` respectively, and the value at `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of the specified expressions.
