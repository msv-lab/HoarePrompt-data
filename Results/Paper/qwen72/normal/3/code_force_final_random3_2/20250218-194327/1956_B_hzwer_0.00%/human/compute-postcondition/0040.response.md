The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `cases`. However, the variable `j` is the one that changes with each iteration of the loop, and it is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs. The list `cases` is not directly modified in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to `n - 2`.

The state of `cases` does not need to be adjusted as it is not part of the loop head's condition.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 2`**
