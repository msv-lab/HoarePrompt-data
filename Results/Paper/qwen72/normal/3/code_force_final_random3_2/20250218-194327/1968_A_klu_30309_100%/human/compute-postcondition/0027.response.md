Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the greatest value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the greatest `max_sum`, and `y` is 0 (or 1 if `x` was 2).**
