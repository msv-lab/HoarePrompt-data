Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 3), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `y` is `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `x - 1` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains 0 and `best_y` remains 1.**

Explanation:
- `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`.
- `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, and `y` is `x - 3`.
- The value of `current_sum` is now `math.gcd(x, x - 3) + (x - 3)`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `x - 1` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` remains 0 and `best_y` remains 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
