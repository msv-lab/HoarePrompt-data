The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop can execute again for the third integer.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` will be the third integer in the list.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop iterations, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the maximum `current_sum`, `y` is 1**
