Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 3` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_sum = gcd_val + y` updates the value of `current_sum` to the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`.
- `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
- `y` is `x - 3`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged except for `current_sum`, which is now `gcd_val + y`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and the loop or if statement is broken.
- If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.
