Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 3`, `y` is `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `max_sum = current_sum` assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`.
- `current_sum` is calculated as `gcd_val + y`.
- `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 3`.
- `y` is `x - 3`.
- Therefore, `max_sum` is now equal to `gcd_val + y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
