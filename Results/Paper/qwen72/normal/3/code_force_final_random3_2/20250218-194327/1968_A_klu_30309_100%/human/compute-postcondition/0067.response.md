Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is 1, and `current_sum` is `1 + (x - 2)`.**

Explanation:
- `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. Since `y` is `x - 2`, and `x` and `x - 1` are consecutive integers, their greatest common divisor is 1. Therefore, `gcd_val` is 1.
- `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`, which is `1 + (x - 2)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
