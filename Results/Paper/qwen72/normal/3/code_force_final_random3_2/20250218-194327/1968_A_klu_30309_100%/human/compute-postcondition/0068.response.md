Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `2 + (x - 2)` which simplifies to `x`.**

Explanation:
- `current_sum` is updated to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`.
- `gcd_val` is 1.
- `y` is `x - 2`.
- Therefore, `current_sum` is `1 + (x - 2)`, which simplifies to `x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
