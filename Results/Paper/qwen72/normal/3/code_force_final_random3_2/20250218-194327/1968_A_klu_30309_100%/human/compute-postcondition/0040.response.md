Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `x - 1 + 1` (which simplifies to `x`). If `x` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `x`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.**
