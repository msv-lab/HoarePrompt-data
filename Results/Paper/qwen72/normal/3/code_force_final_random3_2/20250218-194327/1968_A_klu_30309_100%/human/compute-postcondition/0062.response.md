Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.** 

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `test_cases` is still a list of integers where each integer is between 2 and 1000 and has at least 3 integers, `x` is still the third integer in the list and is at least 2, `results` is still a list containing the value of `best_y` (which is 1) appended to it, `max_sum` is now equal to `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` remains 1, `y` remains `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is still the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, and `current_sum` is still `gcd_val + y`.
