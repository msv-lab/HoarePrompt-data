The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `array`. For the loop to execute, `array` must have at least one element, and `j` will take the value of the first element in `array` at the start of the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `l` is an input integer greater than 0
- `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0
- `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0
- `j` is the last element in `array`
- `ans` is an empty string

To ensure the loop can execute, `array` must have at least one element, and `j` should be the first element in `array` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 1, `j` is the first element in `array`, `ans` is an empty string**
