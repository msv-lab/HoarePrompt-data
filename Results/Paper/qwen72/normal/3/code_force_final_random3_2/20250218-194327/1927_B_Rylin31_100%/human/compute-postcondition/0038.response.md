Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least one element, `j` is the first element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`**

Explanation:
- `ans` is initially an empty string.
- `j` is the first element in `array`.
- `s[j]` is the element in the list `s` at the index `j`. Since `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `s[j]` is 0.
- `s[j] + 97` is 97, which corresponds to the ASCII value of the character 'a'.
- `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends the character 'a' to the string `ans`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
