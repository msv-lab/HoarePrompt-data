### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array `s` is used to keep track of the count of each character in the resulting string.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The program iterates over each element `j` in the trace array `array`.
   - For each `j`, it determines the character to append to the result string `ans` by converting `s[j]` to a character using `chr(s[j] + 97)`. This works because `s[j]` starts at 0 and increments for each occurrence, and `chr(97)` is 'a', `chr(98)` is 'b', and so on.
   - After appending the character, it increments `s[j]` to reflect that the character has been used.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Trace Array Interpretation**:
  - The trace array `a` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the string `s`.
  - For example, if `a[i] = 0`, it means the character at position `i` has not appeared before.
  - If `a[i] = 1`, it means the character at position `i` has appeared once before.

- **Character Assignment**:
  - The program uses the `s` array to keep track of the count of each character.
  - When `s[j]` is used to determine the character, it ensures that the character is assigned correctly based on the trace array.
  - For instance, if `a[i] = 0`, `s[0]` will be 0, and `chr(97 + 0)` will be 'a'. If `a[i] = 1`, `s[1]` will be 0 initially, and `chr(97 + 0)` will be 'a', but after the first use, `s[1]` will be 1, and `chr(97 + 1)` will be 'b'.

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly reconstructs a string that matches the given trace array.
  - The use of `s[j]` to determine the character and then incrementing `s[j]` ensures that the character count is maintained accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string based on the given trace array and meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
