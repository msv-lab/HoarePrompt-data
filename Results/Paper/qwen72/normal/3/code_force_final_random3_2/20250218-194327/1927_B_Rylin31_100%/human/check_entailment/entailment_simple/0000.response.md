### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `l` of the string and the trace `array`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A list `s` of length `l` is initialized with all elements set to 0. This list will keep track of how many times each character has appeared so far.

3. **String Reconstruction:**
   - The function iterates over each element `j` in the trace `array`.
   - For each `j`, it appends the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` to the result string `ans`. The value `s[j] + 97` is used to convert the count to a character in the range `a-z`.
   - After appending the character, it increments `s[j]` by 1 to reflect that the character has been used.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the reconstructed string `ans` for each test case.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as specified.
   - The logic for reconstructing the string from the trace is sound. The trace `a_i` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i`, and the function uses this information to determine the correct character to append.
   - The use of `chr(s[j] + 97)` ensures that the characters are within the range `a-z`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` from the given trace `array` for each test case, and it adheres to the problem's constraints and requirements.
