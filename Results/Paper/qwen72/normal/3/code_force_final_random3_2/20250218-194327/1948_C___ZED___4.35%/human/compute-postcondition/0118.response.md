Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 5.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is 5.
   - If the character at index `k` (which is 5) of `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The variable `k` is explicitly given a value of 5.
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **5**
