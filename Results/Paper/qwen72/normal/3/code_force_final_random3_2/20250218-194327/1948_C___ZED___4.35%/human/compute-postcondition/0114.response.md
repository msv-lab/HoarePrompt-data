Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 4.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `no_path` is False if the character at index 1 of `a` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains True.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of the variable `k`.
   - According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly defined as 3.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **3**
