Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not `>`, the state remains unchanged. If the second-to-last character of `b` is `>`, and `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the last even index less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially False, `k` is the last odd index less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index from 1 to `k` in `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True. Additionally, if the `else` part is executed, `no_path` is set to False.***
