Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each integer 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and two lists of strings row1 and row2 (each string of length n and consisting of characters '<' and '>'). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
