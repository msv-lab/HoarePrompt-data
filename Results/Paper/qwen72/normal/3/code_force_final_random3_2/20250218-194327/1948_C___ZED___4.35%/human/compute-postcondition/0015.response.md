The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and `n`. The loop increments `k` by 2 in each iteration, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 2, so `k` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `k` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>', `k` is 2. If the character at the current index `k` of `b` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
