### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of columns), and the strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The first check is if the second-to-last character in `b` (i.e., `b[-2]`) is not '>'. If this is the case, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because it needs a way to move to the last column from the second-to-last column in the second row. If `b[-2]` is not '>', the function prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case.
   - The second check is if `n` is 1. However, this check is incorrect because the problem states that `n` is always at least 2 and is even. Therefore, this check should be removed.

3. **Path Checking:**
   - The function then checks if there is a path by iterating over the even indices of `b` and the odd indices of `a` to see if any of these indices have an arrow that is not '>'.
   - The variable `no_path` is initially set to `True`.
   - The first loop iterates over the even indices of `b` (from 0 to `n-1` in steps of 2). If any of these indices have an arrow that is not '>', `no_path` is set to `False`.
   - The second loop iterates over the odd indices of `a` (from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2). If any of these indices have an arrow that is not '>', `no_path` is set to `False`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If `no_path` remains `True` after both loops, it means that all even indices in `b` and all odd indices in `a` have arrows pointing to the right, allowing the robot to potentially reach the cell (2, n). The function prints 'YES'.
   - If `no_path` is `False`, it means that there is at least one index where the robot cannot move to the right, and the function prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- The check `if n == 1` is incorrect and should be removed because `n` is always at least 2 and is even.
- The logic for checking the path is flawed. The robot can move in multiple ways, and the current logic only checks if all even indices in `b` and all odd indices in `a` have arrows pointing to the right, which is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

### Correct Logic:
- The robot can move in four directions: left, right, up, and down.
- The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n).
- The robot can move to the next cell in the same row or to the cell directly below or above it.
- The robot must follow the arrows in the current cell after making its move.
- To reach (2, n), the robot must be able to move to the second row and then move to the right until it reaches the last column.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        else:
            can_reach = False
            for k in range(n):
                if k % 2 == 0 and a[k] == '>':
                    can_reach = True
                    break
                if k % 2 == 1 and b[k] == '>':
                    can_reach = True
                    break
            if can_reach:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected program checks if the robot can move to the right from any even-indexed cell in the first row or any odd-indexed cell in the second row.
- If the robot can move to the right from any of these cells, it can potentially reach the cell (2, n).
- If the robot cannot move to the right from any of these cells, it cannot reach the cell (2, n).

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the path checking.
- The corrected program is correct and should be used instead.

Correctness: **False**
