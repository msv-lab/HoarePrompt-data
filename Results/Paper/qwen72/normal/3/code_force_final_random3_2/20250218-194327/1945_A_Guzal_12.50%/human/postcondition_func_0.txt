The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each of the `n` test cases, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. The function then calculates and prints a value `k` based on the following rules: If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `k = a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, or `k = a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c) % 3 == 0`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case will have been processed and the corresponding `k` value will have been printed for each.
