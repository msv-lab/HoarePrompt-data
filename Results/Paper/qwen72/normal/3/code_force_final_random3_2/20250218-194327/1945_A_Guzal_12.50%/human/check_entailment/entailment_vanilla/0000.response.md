### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Tent Calculation:**
   - **Introverts (a):** Each introvert needs a separate tent, so `a` tents are required for introverts.
   - **Extroverts (b):** Each tent for extroverts must contain exactly 3 people. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `(b + c) // 3`, where `c` is the number of universals that can be used to fill the tents.
   - **Universals (c):** Universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts. If there are any remaining universals after filling the extrovert tents, they can be placed in separate tents or shared with other universals.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`. This condition is intended to ensure that if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, the program outputs `-1`.
   - If the condition is not met, the program calculates the total number of tents required as `a + (b + c) // 3` and adds 1 if there are any remaining people after filling the tents.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of tents required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Condition:
- The condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is intended to handle cases where it is impossible to form complete tents for extroverts with the available universals.
- However, this condition is not entirely correct. It should be simplified to check if it is impossible to form complete tents for extroverts, which is when `b % 3 != 0` and `c < (3 - b % 3)`. This ensures that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for calculating the number of tents is generally correct, but the condition for checking impossibility is flawed.
- The correct condition should be `if b % 3 != 0 and c < (3 - b % 3): print(-1)` instead of the current `if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0: print(-1)`.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect due to the flawed condition for checking impossibility.

### Correctness: **False**
