Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of the Failure:**
- In this case, there is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal.
- The introvert must be alone in a tent.
- The extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly 2 others.
- The universal can be in any tent configuration, but there is only one universal available, which is not enough to fulfill the extrovert's requirement of being in a tent with 2 others.
- Therefore, it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, and the expected output should be `-1`.
- However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

The program's logic fails to correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
