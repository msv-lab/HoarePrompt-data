The code snippet `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the code will use `a[3]` and `a[2]` to compute the difference. The initial state specifies that `ans` is `ans * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`, and `n` must be greater than 3. After the code execution, `ans` will be `ans * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * (a[3] - a[2])`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans` is now `ans * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * (a[3] - a[2])`**
