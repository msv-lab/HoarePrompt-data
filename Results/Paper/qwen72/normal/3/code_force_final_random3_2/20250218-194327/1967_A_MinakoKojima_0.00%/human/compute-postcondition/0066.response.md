The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`**
