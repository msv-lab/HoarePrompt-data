The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans` is now `ans * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`**
