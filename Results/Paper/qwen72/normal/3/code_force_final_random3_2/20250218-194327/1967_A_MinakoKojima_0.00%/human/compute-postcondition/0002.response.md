Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input.** 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, and `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input. The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new user input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
