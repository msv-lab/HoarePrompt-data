The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a[i]` for all `i` in range `n` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each iteration, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`**
