Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0, which was already the case in the initial state. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The loop condition for `_` being less than `t` is still valid, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m` remain as they were initially.
