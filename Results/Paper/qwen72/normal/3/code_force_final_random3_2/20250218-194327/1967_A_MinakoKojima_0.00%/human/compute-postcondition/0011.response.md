Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `min(k, m + k // n - a[0])` from its current value.
- The value of `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
