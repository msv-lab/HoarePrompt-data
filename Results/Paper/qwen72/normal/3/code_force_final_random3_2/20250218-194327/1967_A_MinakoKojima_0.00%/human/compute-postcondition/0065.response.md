Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`.
