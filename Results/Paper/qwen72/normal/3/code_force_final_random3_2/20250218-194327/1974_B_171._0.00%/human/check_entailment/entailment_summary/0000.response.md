Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The decoding process should reverse the encoding process, where each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character from the auxiliary string `r` (constructed from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order). However, the function `func_1` in the program is creating a mapping from each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in a sequential manner, which is not the intended behavior.

The correct approach should be:
1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string, which consists of all distinct characters in alphabetical order.
2. Create a mapping where the first character of `r` maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not follow these steps. Instead, it maps each character in the encoded string to a new character starting from 'a' and moving up, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
