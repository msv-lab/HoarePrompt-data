To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` will take on values from 97 to 122 (inclusive). For the loop to start, `c` must be initialized to the first value in this range, which is 97.

The state of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `mapping` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the initial state of `c` must be set correctly.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97, and if 'z' is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'z' mapped to `char`. If 'z' is already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` remains unchanged. In both cases, `char` is the next character in `encoded`.**
