Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97 and `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. If `char` is in `mapping`, the `decoded` list now includes the value of `mapping[char]` appended to it. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `decoded` now includes the character 'z' at the end, `c` is 122, and if 'z' is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'z' mapped to `char`. If 'z' is already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` remains unchanged. In both cases, `char` is the next character in `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters. `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`. If `char` is in `mapping`, the `decoded` list now includes the value of `mapping[char]` appended to it. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `decoded` now includes the character 'z' at the end, `c` is 122, and if 'z' is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'z' mapped to `char`. If 'z' is already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` remains unchanged. In both cases, `char` is the next character in `encoded`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
