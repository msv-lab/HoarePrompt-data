Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the string as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` attempts to create a mapping from characters in the encoded string to characters in the original string, but it does not follow the encoding algorithm specified. Instead of creating a mapping based on the distinct characters in the encoded string in alphabetical order and then replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart, it simply assigns the first available character from 'a' to 'z' that has not been used in the mapping. This approach will not produce the correct decoding.

For example, consider the encoded string "serofedsoc". According to the problem description, the string `r` should be "cdefors", and the decoding should map 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', 'r' to 'd', 'o' to 'e', 'f' to 'd', 'e' to 'o', 'd' to 'r', 's' to 'c', and 'c' to 's'. However, the provided program will produce a different and incorrect mapping, leading to an incorrect decoded string.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:
1. Identify the distinct characters in the encoded string and sort them alphabetically.
2. Create a mapping where the first character in the sorted list is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The current implementation fails to meet these requirements, making it incorrect.
