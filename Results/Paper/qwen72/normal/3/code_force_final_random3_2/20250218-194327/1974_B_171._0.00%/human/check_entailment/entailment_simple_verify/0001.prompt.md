You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating a new string `r` which consists of all distinct letters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character in `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second last, and so on).

2. **Understanding the Decoding Process:**
   - To decode the string, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We need to reconstruct the string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
   - Once we have `r`, we can map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` using the symmetric replacement.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the character mappings.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.
   - For each character in the encoded string `encoded`, it checks if the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary.
     - If it is, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
     - If it is not, it iterates through the lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' to find a letter that is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary.
     - It then maps this letter to the current character in `encoded` and appends the letter to the `decoded` list.

5. ** Issues with the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly reconstruct the string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
   - The mapping is not based on the distinct characters in the encoded string, but rather on the first available letter from 'a' to 'z' that is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary.
   - This approach will not correctly decode the string because it does not follow the symmetric replacement rule based on the distinct characters in the encoded string.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem. It fails to reconstruct the string `r` from the encoded string `b` and does not use the symmetric replacement rule correctly. Therefore, the output will not match the expected decoded string.
