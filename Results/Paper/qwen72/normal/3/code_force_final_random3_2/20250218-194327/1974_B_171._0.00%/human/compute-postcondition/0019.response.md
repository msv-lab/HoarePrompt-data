Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` remains an empty list, `c` is 97, and `mapping` is a dictionary with the key 'a' mapped to `char`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- The loop checks if the current character (starting from 'a') is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary.
- If the character is not in the values of `mapping`, it maps the character to `char` and breaks out of the loop.
- Since the loop breaks after the first iteration, `c` remains 97 (the ASCII value of 'a').
- The `mapping` dictionary will have only one entry: 'a' mapped to `char`.
- The `decoded` list remains empty because it is not modified within the loop.
- The `encoded` string remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
