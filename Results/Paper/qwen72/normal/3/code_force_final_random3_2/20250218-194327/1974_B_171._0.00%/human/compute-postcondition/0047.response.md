The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. The loop iterates over the range from the ASCII value of 'a' to the ASCII value of 'z' (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 98, and `char` is the next character in `encoded`. If `chr(c)` (which is 'b') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'b' mapped to `char`. If 'z' is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'z' mapped to the previous `char`. If 'z' is already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
