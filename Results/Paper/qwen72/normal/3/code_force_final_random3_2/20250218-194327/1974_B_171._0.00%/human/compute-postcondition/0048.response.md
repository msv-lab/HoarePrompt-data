Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 98, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `mapping` now includes the key 'b' mapped to `char`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is 'b' (since `c` is 98 and `chr(98)` is 'b') and the value is `char`.
- The initial state specifies that `char` is the next character in `encoded`, so the value of `char` is updated in `mapping` with the key 'b'.
- The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The condition about 'z' not being in `mapping.values()` does not affect the current state since the code only adds the key 'b' to `mapping`.
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
