The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `c` and the range defined by `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. The loop will continue to execute as long as `c` is within the range `ord('a')` (97) to `ord('z')` (122).

Since `c` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `c` will be 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'. The loop will execute again if `c` is within the specified range, which it is.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 99, `char` is the next character in `encoded`. If `chr(c)` (which is 'c') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'c' mapped to `char`. If 'c' is already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
