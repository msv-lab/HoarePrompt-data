Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. However, the decoding logic in the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the reverse of the encoding process described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Encoding Process**:
   - The original string `s` is transformed into a new string `r` that contains all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r` (the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on).

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode the string, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means we need to:
     - Identify the distinct characters in the encoded string and sort them alphabetically to form `r`.
     - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
     - Replace each character in the encoded string using this mapping to get the original string `s`.

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` creates a mapping from each unique character in the encoded string to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a' and going up to 'z'.
   - This mapping is incorrect because it does not follow the symmetric replacement rule described in the encoding process.
   - Instead, it maps each unique character to the next available letter in the alphabet, which is not the reverse of the encoding process.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach would be to:
     - Extract all distinct characters from the encoded string and sort them to form `r`.
     - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
     - Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct decoded string for the given encoded strings.

Correctness: **False**
