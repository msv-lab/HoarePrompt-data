Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `mapping` is a dictionary. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, then `mapping` has the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary except for the key 'a'. `decoded` remains an empty list, and `c` is 97. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
