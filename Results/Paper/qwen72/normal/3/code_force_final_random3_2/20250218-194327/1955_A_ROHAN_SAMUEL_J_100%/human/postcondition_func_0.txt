The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the following logic: if `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`; if `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is even and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program state is such that all test cases have been processed and their respective results have been printed.
