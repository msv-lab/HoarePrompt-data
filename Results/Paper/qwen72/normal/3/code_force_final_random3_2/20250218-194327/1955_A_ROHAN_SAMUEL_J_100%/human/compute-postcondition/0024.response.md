The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the range of an integer input by the user. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than the integer input by the user.

State: **`_` is 2, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input by the user, and `n` is greater than 0. If `2 * a < b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `2 * a >= b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds. The parity of `n` (whether it is odd or even) does not affect the final conditions, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
