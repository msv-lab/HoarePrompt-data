To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * n)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `_` is 2, but this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are new integer values input by the user.
3. The condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` holds based on the new values of `a` and `b`.

The `print` statement will output the product of `a` and `n`. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are input by the user, we don't have explicit values for these variables. However, we can describe the output based on the given information:

- `a` is an integer input by the user.
- `n` is another integer input by the user.
- The condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` must hold true, but this condition does not directly affect the value of `a * n`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement will be the product of the user-input values `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are the integer values input by the user)**
