Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are integers input by the user.
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n // 2 * b)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will result in an integer.
   - The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Let's denote `n // 2` as `k`. Since `n` is even, `k` is an integer and `k = n / 2`.
   - The expression `k * b` will be the final value printed.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value printed will be `k * b`, where `k` is `n // 2` and `b` is the third integer input by the user.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is an even integer greater than 0 and b is the third integer input by the user)**
