Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the new integer values input by the user. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` holds based on the new values of `a` and `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` also holds based on the new values of `a` and `b`.***
