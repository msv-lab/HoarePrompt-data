Reasoning:  
The program is designed to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Odd `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price, so the cost is `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, it is cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and then buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price. The cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price, so the cost is `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The cost is `n // 2 * b`.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is even, the cost is `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
  - **Output**: 9 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - **Output**: 14 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the cost is `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
  - **Output**: 15 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is even, the cost is `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
  - **Output**: 20 (Correct)

The program correctly handles both even and odd values of `n` and calculates the minimum cost based on the given conditions. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
