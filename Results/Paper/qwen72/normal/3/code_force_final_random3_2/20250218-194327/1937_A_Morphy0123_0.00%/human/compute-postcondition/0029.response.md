The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 4, and `n` is an input integer greater than 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)`.

Given that `n` is greater than 8, the minimum value of `log2(n)` is `log2(9)`, which is approximately 3.17. Since `power` is 4, it is already greater than `log2(9)`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be such that `log2(n)` is greater than 4. The smallest integer `n` that satisfies this condition is 16, since `log2(16) = 4`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 16.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 16, `power` is 4**
