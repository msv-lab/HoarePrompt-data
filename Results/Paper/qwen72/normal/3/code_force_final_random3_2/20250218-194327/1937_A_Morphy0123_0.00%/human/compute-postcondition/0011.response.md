The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3 and `log2(n)` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3, which means `n` must be greater than 2^3 (i.e., 8).

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3**
