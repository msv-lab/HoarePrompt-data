Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `power`. If `n` is greater than 2, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains the same. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.***
