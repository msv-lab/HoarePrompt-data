The function `func` does not take any input parameters directly. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), which represents the length of an array `a`. The function is expected to return a result based on the value of `n` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of an array `a`. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the value of `n`.**
