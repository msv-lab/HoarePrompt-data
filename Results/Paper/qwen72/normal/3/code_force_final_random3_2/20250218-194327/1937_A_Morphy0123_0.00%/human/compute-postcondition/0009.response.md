The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `log2(n)`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2, which means `log2(n)` is greater than 1. However, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2**
