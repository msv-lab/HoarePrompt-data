You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints a result based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with an array \( a \) where \( a_i = i \) for \( 1 \le i \le n \).
   - We perform the operation \(\texttt{swap}(i)\) for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - The operation \(\texttt{swap}(i)\) swaps \( a_i \) with \( a_d \), where \( d \) is the largest divisor of \( i \) that is not equal to \( i \) itself.
   - We need to find the position of 1 in the resulting array.

2. **Analyzing the Swap Operation:**
   - For a number \( i \), the largest divisor \( d \) of \( i \) that is not \( i \) itself is \( i / 2 \) if \( i \) is even.
   - If \( i \) is odd, the largest divisor \( d \) is less than \( i / 2 \).

3. **Effect of Swaps:**
   - When \( i \) is a power of 2, the largest divisor \( d \) is \( i / 2 \), which is also a power of 2.
   - For example, if \( i = 4 \), then \( d = 2 \). If \( i = 8 \), then \( d = 4 \).
   - This means that the element at position \( i \) will eventually move to position \( 2^k \) where \( k \) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( \log_2(n) \).

4. **General Pattern:**
   - For \( n = 1 \), the array is \([1]\) and no swaps are performed, so the position of 1 is 1.
   - For \( n > 1 \), the element 1 will move to the position of the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - If \( n = 1 \), it prints 1.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) using a loop and prints \( 2^{\text{power}} \).

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the base case \( n = 1 \).
   - The loop to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) is incorrect. It should be:
     ```python
     power = int(log2(n))
     ```
   - The program should print \( 2^{\text{power}} \) for the position of 1.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \). It should use the `int(log2(n))` to find the highest power of 2, and then print \( 2^{\text{power}} \). The current implementation incorrectly increments the power and checks if it equals \( n \), which is not the correct approach.
