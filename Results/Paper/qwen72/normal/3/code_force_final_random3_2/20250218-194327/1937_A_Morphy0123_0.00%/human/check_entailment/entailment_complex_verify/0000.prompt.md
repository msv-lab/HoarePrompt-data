You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be called with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a, and the function should handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of n.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `n_cases` is 0, `i` is `n_cases - 1`, and `n` is an input integer for each test case. For each test case, if `n` is 1, the output is 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the output is \(2^{\text{power}}\) where `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the output is \(2^{\text{power}}\). Otherwise, the output is \(2^{\text{power} - 1}\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints a result based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the way it calculates the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the swap operations. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the power of 2 and does not correctly handle the largest divisor of `k` for each `k` from 2 to `n`.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input `n = 6`. According to the problem description, the array `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The operations are performed as follows:

1. **swap(2)**: `a` becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (swap `a[1]` and `a[2]`).
2. **swap(3)**: `a` becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (no change, since 3 has no divisors other than 1 and 3).
3. **swap(4)**: `a` becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (swap `a[2]` and `a[4]`), resulting in `[2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 6]`.
4. **swap(5)**: `a` becomes `[2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 6]` (no change, since 5 has no divisors other than 1 and 5).
5. **swap(6)**: `a` becomes `[2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 6]` (swap `a[3]` and `a[6]`), resulting in `[2, 4, 6, 1, 5, 3]`.

After all operations, the position of 1 in the array is 4. However, the program will output 8 for `n = 6`, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to understand that the position of 1 after performing the swap operations is determined by the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. This is because the largest power of 2 will always be the largest divisor of the next power of 2, and the swaps will eventually move 1 to the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(2 ** (int(log2(n))))
```

This implementation correctly calculates the position of 1 in the resulting array for all valid inputs.
