Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\), and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

The value of `power` is decremented by 1, so `power` is now the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\). The other variables remain unchanged.
