The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `n`, and `r`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n + r + 1`. If `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n + r` must be at least 1, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` remains the input integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n + r` must still be at least 1. The condition `j < n + r + 1` must hold true for the next iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- `n + r` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`j` is 2, `n + r` must be at least 2, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` remains the input integer.**
