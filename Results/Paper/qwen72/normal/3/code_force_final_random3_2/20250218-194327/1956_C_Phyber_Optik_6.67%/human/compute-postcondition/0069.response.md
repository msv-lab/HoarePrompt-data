Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n + r` must be at least 1.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` remains the input integer.
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will print the integer `1` and the value of `j`.
   - The value of `j` is explicitly given as 1 in the initial state.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the print function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - The integer `1` will be printed first.
   - The value of `j`, which is 1, will be printed next.
   - The output will end with a space.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **1 1 **
