Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `t` is unchanged (we don't have information about `t`).
   - `_` is incremented by `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `n + r` must be greater than 0 (we don't have information about `r`).
   - `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first element printed is the integer `2`.
   - The second element printed is `j % n`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `j` is greater than `n` (as per the precondition).
   - `j % n` will be the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `j` is greater than `n`, `j % n` will be a value between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), because the remainder of any integer `j` divided by `n` is always less than `n`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `2` followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and the output will end with a space.

Output: **2 [j % n] (where [j % n] is the remainder of j divided by n, and j is greater than n)**
