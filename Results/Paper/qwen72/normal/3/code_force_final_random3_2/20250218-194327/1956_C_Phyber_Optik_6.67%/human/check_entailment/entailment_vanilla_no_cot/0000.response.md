Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum sum by iterating through the rows and columns, but the logic is flawed. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element can be a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). This is because each row and each column can be filled with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), and there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns.
   - The program's sum calculation logic is incorrect and does not match the expected maximum sum.

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations**:
   - The program outputs \( n + r \) operations, which is not necessarily the correct number of operations. The problem specifies that the solution should use no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The variable \( r \) is used to determine the number of additional operations, but the logic for setting \( r \) is not clear and does not ensure that the number of operations is within the limit.

3. **Incorrect Operation Types**:
   - The program outputs operations of type 1 and type 2, but the logic for choosing which type to use is not clear and does not follow the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the program outputs type 2 operations for \( j > n \), but the column index \( j \% n \) can be zero, which is invalid since column indices start from 1.

### Correct Approach:

To maximize the sum of the matrix, you can perform \( n \) type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). This will ensure that each element in the matrix is a distinct integer from 1 to \( n \), and the sum will be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sum Calculation**: The maximum sum is calculated as \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) repeated \( n \) times.
- **Number of Operations**: The program outputs exactly \( n \) operations, which is within the limit of \( 2n \).
- **Operation Types**: Each operation is of type 1, and it fills the \( i \)-th row with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

This approach ensures that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values, and the number of operations is minimized.
