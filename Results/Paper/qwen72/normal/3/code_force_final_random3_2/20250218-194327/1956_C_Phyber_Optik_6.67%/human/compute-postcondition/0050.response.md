Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value (which was 0).
- The value of `sum` is now `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
