Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `j` is `n + r` where `r` is 0 or 1. `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the previous value of `sum` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `sum` is `3 * n`. `r` is 2 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `r` is 0 or 1. `sum` is now `sum + 3 * n`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by the product of `i` and `n`.
- Given that `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 1, the value of `sum` is incremented by `3 * n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
