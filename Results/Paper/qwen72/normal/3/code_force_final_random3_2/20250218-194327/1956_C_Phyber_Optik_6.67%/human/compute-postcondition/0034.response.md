Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `j` is 2.
- `n` and `r` are not explicitly defined, but we know that `j % n` will be calculated based on the current value of `j` and `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

1. The first value printed is `2`, which is the literal integer 2.
2. The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the result of the modulo operation between `j` (which is 2) and `n`. Since `n` is not explicitly defined, we can only describe this as `2 % n`.
3. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 2 % n** (where `2 % n` is the result of the modulo operation between 2 and `n`)
