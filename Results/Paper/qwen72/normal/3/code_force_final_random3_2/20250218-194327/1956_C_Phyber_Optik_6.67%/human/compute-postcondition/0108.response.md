Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n + r` where `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by `n`, and `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i` is `n`**: After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **`n` is the new input integer**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`j` is `n + r` where `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`**: The value of `j` is updated to `n + r`, where `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If the condition was never met, `r` remains 0.
- **`t` is unchanged**: The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- **`_` is incremented by `n`**: The variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so after `n` iterations, `_` is incremented by `n`.
- **`sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`**: The variable `sum` accumulates the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, and the value of `i * n` for each `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` is true. This means `sum` will be the total of these values after all iterations.
