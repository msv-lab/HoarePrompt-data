To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables `j`, `n`, and `r` that are present in the loop head. The loop will execute if the range defined by `range(1, n + r + 1)` contains at least one value. This means that `n + r + 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `n + r` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `n + r`
- `t` is unchanged
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`
- `i` is `n`
- `n` remains the input integer

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `j` must be initialized to 1 (the starting value of the range), and `n + r` must be at least 1 to ensure the range has at least one value.

State: **`j` is 1, `n + r` must be at least 1, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `i` is `n`, `n` remains the input integer**
