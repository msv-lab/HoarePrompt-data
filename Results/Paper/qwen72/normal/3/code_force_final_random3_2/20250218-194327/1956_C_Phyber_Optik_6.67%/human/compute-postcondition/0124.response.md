The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `n`, and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the expression `n + r + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the new input integer
- `j` is 2
- `t` is unchanged
- `_` is incremented by `n`
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`
- `n + r` must be greater than 0
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` remains less than or equal to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, `j` remains greater than `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is now 3.
- `n` and `r` remain unchanged.
- The loop condition `j < n + r + 1` must still be true for the loop to execute again.

Given that `j` is 2 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 2 (since `j` will be 3 in the next iteration).

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is 3, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by `n`, `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` remains less than or equal to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, `j` remains greater than `n`.**
