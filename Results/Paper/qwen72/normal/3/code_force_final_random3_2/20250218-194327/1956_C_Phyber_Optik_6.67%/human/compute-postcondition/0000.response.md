The value of `t` is assigned the integer value of the input. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix. The number of test cases `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅10^5.
