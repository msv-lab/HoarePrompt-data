Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `n + r` must be at least 1, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` remains the input integer. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.**
