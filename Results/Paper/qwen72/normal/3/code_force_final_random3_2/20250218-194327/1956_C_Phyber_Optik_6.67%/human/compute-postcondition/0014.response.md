The value of `sum` is incremented by `i * n`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, so `i * n` is at least 4. The value of `sum` was initially either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` was `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. After the code execution, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n`.

If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` was `i * n` and `r` is 0. After the code execution, `sum` becomes `2 * n + 2 * n` or `4 * n`.

The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `r` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `4 * n` and `r` is 0.**
