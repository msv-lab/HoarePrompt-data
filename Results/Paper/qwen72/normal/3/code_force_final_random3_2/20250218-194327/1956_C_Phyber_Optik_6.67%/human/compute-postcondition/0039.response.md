To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 3.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must hold true for the loop to execute again.
- If `j <= n`, the state remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the `range` function**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

2. **Determining the value of `n`**:
   - The initial state does not provide an explicit value for `n`.
   - However, the condition `j <= n + r` and the fact that `j` is 3 can give us some insight.
   - Since `j` is 3 and the condition `j <= n + r` must hold true, `n + r` must be at least 3.
   - The condition `j <= n` is also mentioned, which means `n` must be at least 3 (since `j` is 3).

3. **Output**:
   - Given that `n` must be at least 3, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
