To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `j` is 3.
2. `n + r` must be at least 3.
3. `t` is unchanged.
4. `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
5. `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
6. `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
7. `i` is `n`.
8. `n` remains the input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so the integers will be printed separated by spaces.

### Variables:
- `n` is an input integer, and it remains unchanged throughout the process.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function will generate a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer)**

This output is a sequence of integers starting from 1 and ending at `n`, with each integer separated by a space.
