To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is `n + r`
- `t` is unchanged
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`
- `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`
- `r` is 1 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and 0 otherwise
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `i` will be 2.
   - The loop will check if `i` (which is now 2) is less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` must be incremented to 2.
- `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is 1 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and 0 otherwise, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
