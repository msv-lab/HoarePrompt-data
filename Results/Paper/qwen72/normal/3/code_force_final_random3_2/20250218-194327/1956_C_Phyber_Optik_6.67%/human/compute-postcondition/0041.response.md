To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 3.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.
- If `j <= n`, the state remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: The value of `j` is given as 3.
2. **Condition `j <= n + r`**: This condition is mentioned but not directly relevant to the `print` statement. It only affects the loop's execution, which is not part of the code snippet provided.
3. **Condition `j <= n`**: This condition is also mentioned but not directly relevant to the `print` statement. It only affects the state of the program, which is not part of the code snippet provided.
4. **`print(*range(1, n + 1))`**: This statement prints the elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Determining the Output:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so the `print` statement will print these integers separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**
