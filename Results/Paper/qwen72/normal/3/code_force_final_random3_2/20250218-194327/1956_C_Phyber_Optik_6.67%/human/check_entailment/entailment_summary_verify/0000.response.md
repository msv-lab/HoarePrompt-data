Reasoning:

The original assessment points out that the program does not handle the case when `n = 1` correctly. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify this and check if there are any other issues.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum and `r` Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
     - If true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
     - If false, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the calculated `sum` and `n + r`.
   - It then prints a series of lines for each integer `j` from 1 to `n + r`.
     - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1`, `j`, and the integers from 1 to `n`.
     - If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints `2`, `j % n`, and the integers from 1 to `n`.

### Analysis for `n = 1`:

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - For `n = 1`, the loop iterates only once with `i = 1`.
  - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2 > 1 * 1`, which simplifies to `1 > 1`, which is false.
  - Therefore, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`, which is `1 * 1 = 1`.
  - `r` remains 0 because the condition was false.

- **Output**:
  - The function prints `sum` and `n + r`, which is `1 1`.
  - It then prints one line for `j = 1`:
    - `1 1 1`

This output is correct for the case `n = 1`:
- The maximum sum is 1.
- The number of operations is 1.
- The operation is of type 1, applied to the first row, using the permutation `[1]`.

### Analysis for `n > 1`:

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - For `n > 1`, the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
  - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is checked for each `i`.
  - For `i = 1`, the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 1 * n` is true for `n > 1`.
  - Therefore, `r` is set to 1 and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
  - For subsequent `i` values, the condition becomes false, and `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

- **Output**:
  - The function prints `sum` and `n + r`.
  - It then prints `n + r` lines of operations.
  - For `j <= n`, it prints type 1 operations for each row.
  - For `j > n`, it prints type 2 operations for each column.

### Correctness for `n > 1`:

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum calculation logic is flawed. The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.
  - The correct sum for an `n x n` matrix should be `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`, which is the sum of all elements in a matrix where each row and column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

- **Number of Operations**:
  - The number of operations should be `2n` to ensure that each row and column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Corrected Logic:

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we should:
1. Perform `n` type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
2. Perform `n` type 2 operations to fill each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

The correct sum for an `n x n` matrix is `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original program's logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is incorrect, especially for `n > 1`. The program does not ensure that the matrix is filled correctly to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
