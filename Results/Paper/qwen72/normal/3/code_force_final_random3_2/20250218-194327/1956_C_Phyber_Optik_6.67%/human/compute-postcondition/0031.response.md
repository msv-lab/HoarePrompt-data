To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

1. **Current State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `_` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
   - `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true
   - `j` is 1

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, n + r + 1):`
   - This means `j` will start from 1 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n + r`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j <= n + r`.

4. **Final State:**
   - `j` is incremented to 2.
   - The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true, and `j` is 2. If `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` holds true. If `j` is greater than `n + r`, the condition `j > n + r` holds true.**
