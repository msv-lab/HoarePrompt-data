Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is 3.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.
- If `j <= n`, the state remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `j`**: According to the initial state, `j` is explicitly given as 3.
2. **Value of `1`**: This is a constant integer value 1.
3. **Value of `end=' '`**: This parameter in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline.

### What will be printed:
- The `print` function will output the values 1 and 3, separated by a space, and the output will end with a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 3 **
