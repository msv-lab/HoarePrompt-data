The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `n + 1` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, and `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`. `r` is 1 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, otherwise `r` is 0.**
