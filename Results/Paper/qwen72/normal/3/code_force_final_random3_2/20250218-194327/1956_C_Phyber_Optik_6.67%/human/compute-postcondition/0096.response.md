Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**

Explanation:
- `sum` is updated to `i * n`, which is `1 * n` (since `i` is 1).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
