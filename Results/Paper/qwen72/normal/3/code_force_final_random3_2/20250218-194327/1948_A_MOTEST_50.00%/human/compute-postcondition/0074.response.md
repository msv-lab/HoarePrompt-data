Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice, `x` is 0, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `0` of the string `s` repeated twice to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `ans` becomes the string `s[0]` repeated twice. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
