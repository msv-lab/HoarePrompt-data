The code `os.system('cls')` clears the console screen. This does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should be called with a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The console screen is cleared.**
