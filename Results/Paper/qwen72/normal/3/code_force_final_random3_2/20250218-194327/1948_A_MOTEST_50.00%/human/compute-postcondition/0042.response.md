The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n // 2`. For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2 (since any integer `n` less than 2 will result in `n // 2` being 0 or less).

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `j` is 0**
