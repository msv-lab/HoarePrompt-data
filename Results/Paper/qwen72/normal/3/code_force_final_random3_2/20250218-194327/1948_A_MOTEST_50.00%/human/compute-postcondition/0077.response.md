Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice, `x` is 1, `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by concatenating `s[x] * 2` to the existing value of `ans`.
- The existing value of `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice.
- The value of `x` is 1, so `s[x]` is `s[1]`.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
