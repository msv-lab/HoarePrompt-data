### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob simply removes the picked element from `a`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, so she will try to pick elements that are not already in `c` or that appear fewer times in `a`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, so he will try to pick elements that are already in `c` or that appear more frequently in `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and stores them in `cntl`.

4. **Checking for MEX 0:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not present in `a`, so the MEX of `c` will be 0. This is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, it cannot be in `c`.

5. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice will try to include 0 in `c` at least once, and Bob will try to remove it if possible.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that the integer `j` appears fewer than twice in `a`.
     - Alice will try to include `j` in `c` at least once, and Bob will try to remove it if possible.
     - The variable `c` is decremented by 1 each time an integer `j` with fewer than 2 occurrences is found.
     - If `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program correctly handles the optimal play by ensuring that Alice and Bob make the best possible moves to maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.
   - The logic of decrementing `c` and checking the conditions ensures that the MEX is determined correctly based on the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
