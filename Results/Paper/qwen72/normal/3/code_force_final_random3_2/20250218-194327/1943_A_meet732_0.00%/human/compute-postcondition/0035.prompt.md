Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`, and the first element of `cntl` is not 0; `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`, the first element of `cntl` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and the first element of `cntl`. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`, the first element of `cntl` is not 0, `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 1 and the first element of `cntl`. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` remains the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`, the first element of `cntl` is not 0, `j` is 3, `c` remains the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 1 and the first element of `cntl` minus 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `cntl`, and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
