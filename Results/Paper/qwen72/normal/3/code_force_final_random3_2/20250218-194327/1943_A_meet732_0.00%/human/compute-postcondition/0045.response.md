The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `a` must be considered. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be the third element in the list `a`, and the list `a` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 2, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.**
