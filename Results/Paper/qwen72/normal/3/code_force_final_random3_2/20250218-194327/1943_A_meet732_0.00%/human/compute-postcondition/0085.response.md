Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0. The first element of `cntl` is 0, indicating that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`.**
