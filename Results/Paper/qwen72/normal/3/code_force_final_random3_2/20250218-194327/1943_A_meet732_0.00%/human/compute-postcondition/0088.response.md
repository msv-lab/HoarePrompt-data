Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0. Additionally, the element at index 0 in `cntl` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the value at index 0 in `cntl`.** 

Since the element at index 0 in `cntl` is not 0, `c` will be either 2 or the value at index 0 in `cntl`, whichever is smaller. All other variables remain unchanged.
