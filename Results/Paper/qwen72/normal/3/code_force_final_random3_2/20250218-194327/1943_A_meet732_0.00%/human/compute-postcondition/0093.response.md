Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - The value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - `c` is decreased by 1.
   - Either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `j`:**
   - According to the initial state, `j` is explicitly set to 1.

4. **Consider the Other Variables:**
   - `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2, but this does not affect the value of `j`.
   - `c` is decreased by 1, but its exact value is not specified.
   - The condition that either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n` does not change the value of `j` at the point of the print statement.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
