Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`, and the array `a` itself, which contains `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
