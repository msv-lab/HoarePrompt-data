Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer between 1 and 25.**

The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, where `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 and less than 52. Therefore, after the code execution, `lex` is now an integer between 1 and 25. The other variables remain unchanged.
