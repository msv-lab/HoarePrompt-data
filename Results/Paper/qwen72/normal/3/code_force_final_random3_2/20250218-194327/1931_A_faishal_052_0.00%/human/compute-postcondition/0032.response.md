The code `lex = lex - 26` updates the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from its current value. Let's consider the different cases for `lex` based on the initial state:

1. If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, it is now less than or equal to 25.
2. If `lex` was between 26 and 51, it is now between 0 and 25.
3. If `lex` was between 52 and 100, it is now between 26 and 74.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element 26, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, `j` is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now less than or equal to 25. If `lex` was between 26 and 51, `lex` is now between 0 and 25. If `lex` was between 52 and 100, `lex` is now between 26 and 74.**
