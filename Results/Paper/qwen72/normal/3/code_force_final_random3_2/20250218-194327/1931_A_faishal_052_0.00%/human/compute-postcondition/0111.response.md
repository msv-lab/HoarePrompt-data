Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `lex` is `lex - 26`, `arr` contains `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than or equal to -1, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 0 and 25, and `arr` contains `[26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 26.** 

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. The initial conditions for `arr` are based on the original value of `lex`. After subtracting 26 from `lex`, the new conditions for `arr` are updated accordingly. The states of the other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.
