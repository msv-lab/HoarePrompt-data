The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `2`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `1`.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26]` and `lex` is an integer between 1 and 25. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26]` and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26.**
