Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains `[1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for exactly 2 iterations because `j` is initialized to 2 and the loop iterates over `range(2)`.
- After the first iteration:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` becomes `[1]` and `lex` is reduced by 1.
  - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` is reduced by 26.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` is reduced by 26.
- After the second iteration:
  - If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]` and `lex` is reduced by another 1, making it between 0 and 24.
  - If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` becomes `[26, 1]` and `lex` is reduced by another 1, making it between 0 and 25.
  - If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` is reduced by another 26, making it greater than or equal to 26.

Thus, after the loop completes, `j` is 2, and `arr` contains the final values based on the initial value of `lex`.
