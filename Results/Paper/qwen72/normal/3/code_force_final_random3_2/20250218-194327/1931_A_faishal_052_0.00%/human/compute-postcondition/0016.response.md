Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, `lex` is an input integer, and `j` is 0. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is decreased by 1 and is now less than or equal to 25. If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `lex` remains greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `lex` is updated to a value between 1 and 25.***
