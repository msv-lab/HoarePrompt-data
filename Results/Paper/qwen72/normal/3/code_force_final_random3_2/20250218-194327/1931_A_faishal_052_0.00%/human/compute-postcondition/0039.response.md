Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The first two elements of `arr` are either 1 or 26.
   - The third element of `arr` is `lex`, where:
     - `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially.
     - `lex` is between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially.
     - `lex` is `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `arr[k]`:**
   - Since `k` is 0, `arr[k]` refers to the first element of the list `arr`.
   - According to the initial state, the first element of `arr` is either 1 or 26.

4. **Convert `arr[k]` to a Character:**
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The ASCII value for 'a' is 97, so `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
   - Similarly, `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.

5. **Output:**
   - Since the first element of `arr` is either 1 or 26, the print statement will output either 'a' or 'z'.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that the output does not end with a newline, so the next print statement (if any) will continue on the same line.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **'a' or 'z' (where 'a' is the character corresponding to the first element of `arr` being 1, and 'z' is the character corresponding to the first element of `arr` being 26)**
