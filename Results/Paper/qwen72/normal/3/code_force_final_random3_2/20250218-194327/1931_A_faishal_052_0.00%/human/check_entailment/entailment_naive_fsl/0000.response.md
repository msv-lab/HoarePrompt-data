Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
5
24
70
3
55
48
```

**Expected Output:**
```
aav
rzz
aaa
czz
auz
```

**Actual Output from the program:**
```
aav
rzz
aaa
czz
aaz
```

For the input `48`, the program outputs `aaz`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 48. The correct output should be `auz` because `a` (1) + `u` (21) + `z` (26) = 48, and `auz` is lexicographically smaller than `aaz`.

The issue in the program is that it does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining value after subtracting the largest possible values (26) from the input. It should ensure that the remaining value is distributed in a way that results in the lexicographically smallest word.
