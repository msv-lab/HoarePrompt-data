Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1]` or `[1, 26]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 25.***
