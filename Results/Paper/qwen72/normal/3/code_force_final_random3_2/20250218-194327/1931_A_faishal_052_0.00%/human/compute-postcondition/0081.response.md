The `arr.sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `lex` determines the initial contents of `arr`, but after sorting, the list will be in ascending order regardless of the initial order of its elements.

- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is initially `[1, 1, lex]`, and after sorting, it will be `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` > 1, or `[1, lex, 1]` if `lex` = 1. However, since `lex` is between 0 and 24, the sorted list will always be `[1, 1, lex]`.
- If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is initially `[26, 1, lex]`, and after sorting, it will be `[1, 26, lex]`.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is initially `[26, 26, lex]`, and after sorting, it will be `[26, 26, lex]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `lex` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a sorted list `[1, 1, lex]` and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a sorted list `[1, 26, lex]` and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a sorted list `[26, 26, lex]` and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26.**
