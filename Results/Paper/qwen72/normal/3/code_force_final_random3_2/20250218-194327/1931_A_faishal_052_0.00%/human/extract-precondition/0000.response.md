Precondition: **The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and the encoded word for each test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```
def find_smallest_word(t, encoded_words):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and encoded_words is a list of integers (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) where each integer n represents the encoded word for a test case.**
