Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 25, `j` is 0.**

The value of `lex` is updated by subtracting 26 from it. Since `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 and less than 52, the new value of `lex` is now an integer between 1 and 25. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
