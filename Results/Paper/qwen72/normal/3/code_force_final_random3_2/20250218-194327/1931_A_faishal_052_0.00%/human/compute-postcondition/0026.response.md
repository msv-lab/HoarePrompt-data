The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `2`. So, we can only adjust these.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` being less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, once `j` is 2, the loop condition `j in range(2)` will no longer be true, and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly one more time with `j` being 2.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element (1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise 26), `lex` is an input integer, and `j` is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now less than or equal to 25. If `lex` was between 26 and 51, `lex` is updated to a value between 0 and 25. If `lex` was between 52 and 100, `lex` remains an input integer.**
