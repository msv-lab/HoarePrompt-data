The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `2`. The loop will execute a fixed number of times (2 times in this case) regardless of the values of other variables. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, `lex` is an input integer, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is decreased by 1 and is now less than or equal to 25. If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `lex` remains greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `lex` is updated to a value between 1 and 25.**
