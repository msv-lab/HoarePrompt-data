The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `2`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends solely on the value of `j` being less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, since the loop will stop when `j` is 2 (as it is no longer less than 2), the correct state at the start of the next iteration is when `j` is 2, but the loop will not execute again because `j` is not less than 2.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1]` or `[1, 26]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 25.**
