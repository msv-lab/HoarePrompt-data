Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing the value 26, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 25.** 

The value of `lex` is updated to be `lex - 26`, where `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 and less than 52. Therefore, the new value of `lex` is an integer between 1 and 25. The other variables remain unchanged.
