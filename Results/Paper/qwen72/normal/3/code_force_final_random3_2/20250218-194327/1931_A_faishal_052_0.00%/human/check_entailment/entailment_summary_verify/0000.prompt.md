You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing an encoded word. The function then decodes the word into a 3-character string, where the first two characters are either 'a' or 'z' and the third character is determined by the remaining value of `n` after the decoding process. The function prints the decoded string for each test case and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `cases - 1`, and the final state of the program includes the sorted list `arr` with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being the remaining value of `n` after the loop's operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
5
24
70
3
55
48
```

**Expected Output:**
```
aav
rzz
aaa
czz
auz
```

**Actual Output from the program:**
```
aav
rzz
aaa
czz
aaz
```

For the input `48`, the program outputs `aaz`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 48. The correct output should be `auz` because `a` (1) + `u` (21) + `z` (26) = 48, and `auz` is lexicographically smaller than `aaz`.

The issue in the program is that it does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining value after subtracting the largest possible values (26) from the input. It should ensure that the remaining value is distributed in a way that results in the lexicographically smallest word.
