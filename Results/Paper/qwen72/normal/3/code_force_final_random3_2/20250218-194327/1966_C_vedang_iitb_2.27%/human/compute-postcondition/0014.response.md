The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of positive integers with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a). The function returns an integer, which can be either 1 or 2, depending on the specific conditions within the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers and a positive integer `n` within the bounds of the list length. It returns either 1 or 2 based on internal conditions.**
