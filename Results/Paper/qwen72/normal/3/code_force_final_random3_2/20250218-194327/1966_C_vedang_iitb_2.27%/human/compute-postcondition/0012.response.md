Postcondition: **`a` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), and `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1), and `winNext` is not 2, and either `winNext` is not 1 or `a[0]` is 1.**
