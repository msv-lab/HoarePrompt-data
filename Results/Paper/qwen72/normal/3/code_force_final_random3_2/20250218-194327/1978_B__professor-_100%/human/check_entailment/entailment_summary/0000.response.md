Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit is calculated as `n * a`, which is correct.

   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified prices.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` correctly computes this sum.

   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` correctly computes this profit.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as `b <= a` and `b - a >= n` correctly.
   - The arithmetic series sum formula is used correctly in both cases where it is applicable.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function processes each test case in constant time, making it efficient for large inputs (up to \(10^9\)).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified conditions and edge cases, and it produces the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
