Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input, `t` is greater than 1, and `_` is incremented to the next value in the sequence. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the program maintains the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and `_` is incremented. Otherwise, the program also maintains the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and `_` is incremented.***
