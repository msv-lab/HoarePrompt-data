Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned values from the input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `b` is greater than `a`.
   - The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   - `2 * b - n + 1` is a formula that involves the variables `b` and `n`.
   - `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2.
   - The entire expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is then converted to an integer using the `int` function.

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - Given that `b` is greater than `a` and the difference `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, we can infer that `b` is at least `a + n`.
   - However, the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, so we can only describe the output in terms of `b` and `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the integer result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) (where `b` is greater than `a` and the difference `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`)**
