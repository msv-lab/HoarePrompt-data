Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It considers the scenarios where:

1. The modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, in which case it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
2. The difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, in which case it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
3. The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, in which case it calculates the maximum profit by selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case and outputs the results as expected. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
