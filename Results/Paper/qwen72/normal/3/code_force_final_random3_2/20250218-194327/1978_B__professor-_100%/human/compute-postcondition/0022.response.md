Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned integer values from the input.
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `2 * b - n + 1`.
   - Then, we multiply the result by `n`.
   - Finally, we perform integer division by 2 using the `//` operator and convert the result to an integer using `int()`.

4. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `n`: This is an integer value provided as input.
   - `b`: This is another integer value provided as input.
   - `a` and `t` are mentioned but not used in the `print` statement.
   - `_` is mentioned but not used in the `print` statement.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The expression `2 * b - n + 1` is a linear combination of `b` and `n`.
   - Multiplying this result by `n` gives us a product.
   - Integer division by 2 ensures that the result is an integer.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer result of the expression `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given formula.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) (where n and b are the integer values provided as input)**
