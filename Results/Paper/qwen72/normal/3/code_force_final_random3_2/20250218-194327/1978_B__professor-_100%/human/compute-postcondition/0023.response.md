Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned integer values from the input.
- `t` is greater than 2 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned in the initial state).
- `_` is 2 (though `_` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned in the initial state).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `b - a`:**
   - This is the difference between the integer values `b` and `a`.

2. **Calculate `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`:**
   - This is the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers. The formula \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2\) is the sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to `b - a`.

3. **Calculate `a * n`:**
   - This is the product of the integer values `a` and `n`.

4. **Combine the results:**
   - The expression \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\) combines the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers with the product of `a` and `n`.

5. **Convert the result to an integer:**
   - The `int()` function ensures that the result is an integer, which is necessary because the division `//` already results in an integer.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the integer value of the expression \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\).

Output: **(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n (where `b` and `a` are the integer values assigned from the input, and `n` is the integer value assigned from the input)**

This output is the result of the arithmetic operations described in the print statement, using the values of `b`, `a`, and `n` as provided in the initial state.
