Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input, `t` is greater than 1, and `_` is incremented to the next value in the sequence. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is less than `n`, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. In all cases, `_` is incremented.***
