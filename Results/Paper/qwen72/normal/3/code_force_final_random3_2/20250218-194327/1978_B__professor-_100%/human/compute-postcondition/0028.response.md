Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it prints one of three possible results: `n * a` if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer relevant. **
