Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first part of the string at `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of the second part of the string at `data[1]`, `y` is the integer value of the third part of the string at `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the string at `data[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, so `idx` changes from 1 to 3.
- The values of `data`, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
