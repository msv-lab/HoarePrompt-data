Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`.**

The code snippet `ry = a % y` calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `y` and assigns it to the variable `ry`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. The new value of `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
