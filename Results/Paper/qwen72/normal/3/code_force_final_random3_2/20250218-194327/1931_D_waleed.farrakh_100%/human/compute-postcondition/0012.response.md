Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first part of the string at `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of the second part of the string at `data[3]`, `y` is the integer value of the third part of the string at `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the string at `data[4]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))` updates the value of `arr` to be a list of integers obtained by splitting the string at `data[4]` and converting each part to an integer.
- The initial state specifies that `idx` is 3, so `idx + 1` is 4.
- The value of `arr` is now derived from the string at `data[4]`.
- All other variables (`data`, `t`, `test_cases`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
