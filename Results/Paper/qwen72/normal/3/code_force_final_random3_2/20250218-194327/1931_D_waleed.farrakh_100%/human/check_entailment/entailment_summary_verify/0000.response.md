### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is correct and provides a detailed explanation of how the functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step by step to verify this claim.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - It also initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates over each element `a` in the array `arr`.

3. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`. This is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
   - It calculates `ry` as `a % y`. This is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.

4. **Checking for Beautiful Pairs:**
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`.
   - If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.

5. **Updating Frequency Dictionary:**
   - It calculates the current pair of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary `freq` with this pair.

6. **Storing Results:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.

7. **Returning Results:**
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list containing the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It splits the input into lines and stores them in the list `data`.

2. **Extracting Test Cases:**
   - It extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - It initializes an empty list `test_cases` to store the details of each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the first line of the test case.
   - It extracts the array `arr` from the second line of the test case.
   - It appends the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and stores the results in the list `results`.

5. **Printing Results:**
   - It iterates over the `results` list and prints each result to the standard output.

### Evaluation:
1. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic for calculating `rx` and `ry` is correct. `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, and `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - The use of a frequency dictionary `freq` to count pairs is efficient and correct. It ensures that for each element `a`, the number of previous elements that form a beautiful pair with `a` is counted.
   - The update to the frequency dictionary is also correct, ensuring that the current element's pair of remainders is stored for future checks.

2. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes it into the required format.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `x` and `y` can be equal.
   - It also handles the edge cases where the array `arr` can have repeated elements or elements that do not form any beautiful pairs.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient as it uses a dictionary to keep track of remainders, which allows for O(1) lookups and updates.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended and cover all the specified requirements and edge cases in the problem description.

### Final:
Final: **True**
