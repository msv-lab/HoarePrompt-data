Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` calculates the value of `rx` based on the values of `a` and `x` from the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the first element of `arr`, and `x` is the second element of the third tuple.
- The expression `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is a non-negative value less than `x`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
