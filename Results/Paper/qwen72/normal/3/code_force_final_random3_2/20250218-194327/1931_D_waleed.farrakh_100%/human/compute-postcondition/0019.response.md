Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` and the new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 7, `n` is the integer value of the first part of the string at `data[5]`, `x` is the integer value of the second part of the string at `data[5]`, `y` is the integer value of the third part of the string at `data[5]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the string at `data[6]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, so `idx` changes from 5 to 7.
- All other variables (`data`, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
