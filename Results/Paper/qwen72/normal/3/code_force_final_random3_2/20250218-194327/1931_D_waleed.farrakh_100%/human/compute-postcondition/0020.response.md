Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the corresponding parts of the strings at `data[1], data[3], ...`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from the strings at `data[2], data[4], ...`. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings. The variable `t` is still the integer value of the first element in `data`, and it must be at least as large as the number of iterations the loop has completed. The variable `test_cases` is now a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. These elements are derived from the strings in `data` at specific indices, with `n`, `x`, and `y` being integers from the first, second, and third parts of the strings at `data[1], data[3], ...`, and `arr` being a list of integers from the strings at `data[2], data[4], ...`. The variable `idx` is updated to `2 * t + 1`, reflecting the final position in the `data` list after all iterations of the loop.
