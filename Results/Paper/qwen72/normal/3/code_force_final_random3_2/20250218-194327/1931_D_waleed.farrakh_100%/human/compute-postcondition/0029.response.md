The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads from standard input and processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided test cases.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
