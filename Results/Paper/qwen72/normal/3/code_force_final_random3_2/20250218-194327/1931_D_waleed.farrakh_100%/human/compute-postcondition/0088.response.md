Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the second element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary that includes the key `current_pair` with the value 1, `count` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, and `current_pair` is the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` updates the value of `rx` based on the current values of `a` and `x`.
- The value of `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `freq`, `count`, `results`, `ry`, and `current_pair` remain unchanged.
- The value of `rx` is now the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.
