Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is equal to `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rx` is calculated using the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- `a` is the first element in `arr`, and `x` is the second element in the second tuple of `test_cases`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `y`, `arr`, `freq`, and `count` remain unchanged.
- The value of `rx` is now specifically defined as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
