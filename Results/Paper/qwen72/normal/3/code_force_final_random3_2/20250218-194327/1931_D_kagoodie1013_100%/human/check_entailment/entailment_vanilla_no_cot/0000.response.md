Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `arr`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - It initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the counts of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where:
     - `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.
   - For each number `num` in the array, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
   - It then updates the `residue_map` with the current pair of residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic correctly identifies pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The use of residues ensures that the conditions are checked efficiently.

Here's a step-by-step verification of the logic:

- **Residue Calculation**:
  - `r_x = -num % x` calculates the residue of \(-num\) modulo `x`. This is used to check if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x`.
  - `r_y = num % y` calculates the residue of `num` modulo `y`. This is used to check if \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.

- **Dictionary Update**:
  - `current_key = (num % x, num % y)` is the key for the current number's residues.
  - `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` updates the count of this key in the dictionary.

- **Counting Pairs**:
  - `count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` adds the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions to `count`.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
