Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is now `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r_y` is updated to the result of `num % y`.
- The values of `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `current_key`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged, but `r_y` is now specifically the result of `num % y`.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `r_y` and retains the other initial conditions.
