Output State: **`arr` remains a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `count` is 0, `results` is a list that now includes `count` as its last element, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next element in `test_cases`.** 

The dictionary `residue_map` has been initialized to an empty dictionary, but the other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
