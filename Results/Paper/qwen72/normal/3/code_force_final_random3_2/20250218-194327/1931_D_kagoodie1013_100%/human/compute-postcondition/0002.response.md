Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0.**

The variable `count` is initialized to 0, and the other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results`) remain unchanged. The list `test_cases` still contains at least one tuple, and `results` is still an empty list.
