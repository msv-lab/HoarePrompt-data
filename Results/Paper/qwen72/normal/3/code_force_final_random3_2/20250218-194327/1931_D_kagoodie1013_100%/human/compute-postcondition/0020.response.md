Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and has at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 3, `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with the value `2`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable to be a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`. The values of `num % x` and `num % y` are calculated and stored in `current_key`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
