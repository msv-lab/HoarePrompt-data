Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 1, `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with the value `2`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r_y = num % y` updates the value of `r_y` to the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- The value of `num` is the third element of `arr`.
- The value of `r_x` remains `-num % x`.
- The value of `current_key` remains a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.
- All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
