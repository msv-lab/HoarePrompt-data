The code snippet `r_x = -num % x` updates the value of `r_x` to the result of `-num % x`. Let's break down the impact:

- `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple.
- `n` is the first element of the first tuple.
- `x` is the second element of the first tuple.
- `y` is the third element of the first tuple.
- `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 2 elements.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- `residue_map` now contains the key `current_key` with the value `1`.
- `num` is the second element of `arr`.
- `r_x` is updated to the result of `-num % x`.
- `r_y` is the result of `num % y`.
- `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.

Given the initial state, the value of `r_x` is now the result of `-num % x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 2 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` now contains the key `current_key` with the value `1`, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.**
