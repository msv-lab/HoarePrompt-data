### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common and efficient way to handle large inputs.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, storing them in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - It calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` for each element `num` in the array `arr`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` is used to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` is used to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before in `residue_map` and increments the `count` by the number of times this pair has been seen.
   - It then updates `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating `r_x` and `r_y` is correct:
     - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if `r_x` is the same for both `a_i` and `a_j`.
     - `r_y = num % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if `r_y` is the same for both `a_i` and `a_j`.
   - The use of a dictionary `residue_map` to count the occurrences of each residue pair is efficient and appropriate for this problem.
   - The program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description, including the maximum values for `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It correctly processes arrays of different lengths and values within the specified range.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case, processes the input efficiently, and outputs the correct results. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.

Final: **True**
