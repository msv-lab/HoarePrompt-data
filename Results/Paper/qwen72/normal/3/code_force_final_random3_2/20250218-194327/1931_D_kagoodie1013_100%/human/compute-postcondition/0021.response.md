Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and has at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 3, `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with the value `3`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

The code updates the value associated with the key `current_key` in the `residue_map` dictionary. The initial value of `current_key` in `residue_map` was `2`, and after the code executes, it is incremented by 1 to become `3`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
