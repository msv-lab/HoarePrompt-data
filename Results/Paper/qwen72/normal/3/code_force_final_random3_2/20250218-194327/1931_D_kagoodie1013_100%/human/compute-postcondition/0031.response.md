Output State: **`arr` is a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `r_y` is equal to `num % y`, `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map[(r_x, r_y)]` if the key exists, otherwise `count` is unchanged, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y`.**
