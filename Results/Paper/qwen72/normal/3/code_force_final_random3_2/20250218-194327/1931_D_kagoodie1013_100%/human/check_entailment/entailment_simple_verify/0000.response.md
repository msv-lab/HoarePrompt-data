### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).
   - This part of the program is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case and initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
     - It checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` is already in `residue_map` and adds the corresponding count to `count`.
     - It then updates `residue_map` with the current residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Key Points in the Annotated Code:**
   - **State Before Function Call:**
     - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
     - This state is correctly described and matches the problem requirements.
   - **State Inside the Function:**
     - `count` is initialized to 0 for each test case.
     - `residue_map` is used to store the residues of the array elements.
     - For each `num` in `arr`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated correctly.
     - The program correctly adds the count of existing pairs `(r_x, r_y)` to `count`.
     - The program updates `residue_map` with the current residues.
   - **State After Function Call:**
     - `results` is a list containing the final `count` value for each test case.
     - This state is correctly described and matches the expected output format.

4. **Logic Validation:**
   - The logic for calculating `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y` is correct.
   - The program correctly identifies pairs \((i, j)\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x` and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
   - The use of `residue_map` ensures that the program efficiently counts the number of such pairs without explicitly iterating over all pairs, which would be computationally expensive.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\).
   - It also handles the constraint that the sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case, processes the input correctly, handles multiple test cases, and outputs the correct number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Final: **True**
