The value of `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the dictionary `residue_map`. If the key `(r_x, r_y)` is not found in `residue_map`, `count` is incremented by 0. The values of `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, and `r_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map` or by 0 if the key is not found.**
