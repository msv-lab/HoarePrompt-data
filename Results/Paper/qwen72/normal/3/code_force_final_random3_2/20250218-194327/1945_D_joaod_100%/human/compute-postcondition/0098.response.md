Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `custo_pra_passar_b` to a list of integers provided by the user. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, and this list will be used in subsequent calculations involving `total` and `best`.
