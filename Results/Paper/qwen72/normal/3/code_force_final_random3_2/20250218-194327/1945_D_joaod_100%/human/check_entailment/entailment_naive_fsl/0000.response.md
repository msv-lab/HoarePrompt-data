Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the final position `pos_final` is 0. According to the problem description, Kirill can bribe people to move to any position `j` such that `j < i`, and he wants to be among the first `m` people in the line. If `m` is 1, Kirill needs to move to the very front of the line (position 0).

However, the program initializes `best` to `sys.float_info.max` and only updates it when `v <= pos_final`. If `pos_final` is 0, the loop will not find any valid `v` to update `best` because `v` starts from `na_frente - 1` and moves backward. As a result, `best` will remain `sys.float_info.max`, and the program will print an incorrect result.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
Expected output:
```
3
```
Actual output:
```
inf
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where Kirill needs to move to the very front of the line.
