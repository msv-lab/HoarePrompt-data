The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the variable `cases`. The loop can execute again if `c` is less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0 and `cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, and `cases` must still be greater than `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` (initially an input integer minus 1) down to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
