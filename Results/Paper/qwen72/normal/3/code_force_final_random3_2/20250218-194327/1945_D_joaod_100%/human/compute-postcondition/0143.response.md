The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m`: integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `b`: a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9

The function returns a value based on the provided inputs, but the specific output is not described in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the constraints and relationships between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. It returns a result based on the constraints and relationships between these parameters.**
