Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
