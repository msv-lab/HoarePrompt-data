Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. If the first character of `c` is equal to either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b`, `possible` remains False and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
