Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. In such a case, it is still possible to find a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. However, the program incorrectly sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop, which can lead to incorrect results.

Example of a failing case:
```
Input:
1
3
abc
def
ghi

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this case, `a = "abc"`, `b = "def"`, and `c = "ghi"`. The template "ABC" would match `a` and `b` but not `c`, so the expected output should be "YES". However, the program outputs "NO" because it incorrectly handles the scenario where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is different from both.
