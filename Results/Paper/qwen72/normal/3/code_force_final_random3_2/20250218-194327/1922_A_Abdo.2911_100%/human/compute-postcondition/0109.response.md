The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 1. `possible` is False if the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is equal to either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b`, otherwise `possible` is True and the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
