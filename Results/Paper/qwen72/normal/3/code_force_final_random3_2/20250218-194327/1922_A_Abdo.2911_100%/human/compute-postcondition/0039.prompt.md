Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `possible` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases, `possible` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` or `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
