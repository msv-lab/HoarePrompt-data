Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is equal to either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
