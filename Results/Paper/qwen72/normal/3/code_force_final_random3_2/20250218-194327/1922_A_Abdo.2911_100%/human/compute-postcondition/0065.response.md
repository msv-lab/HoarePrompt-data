The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 1.**
