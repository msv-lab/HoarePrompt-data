Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.***
