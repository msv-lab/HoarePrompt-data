Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is True if at any point during the loop, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = input().strip()` assigns a new value to `a` by taking a string input from the user and removing any leading or trailing whitespace.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `a` is now a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, but the conditions for `possible` remain the same as they depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` during the loop execution.
