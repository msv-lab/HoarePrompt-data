Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' or 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0.**

The initial state specifies the function's parameters and the constraints on those parameters. The code snippet initializes two variables, `ma` and `mi`, to 0. Since no other operations are performed on these variables or any other variables, the values of `ma` and `mi` remain 0. The function parameters and constraints remain unchanged.
