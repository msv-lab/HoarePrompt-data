You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value as specified in the annotated code. However, it reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the user input. It calculates the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` (`mi`) and the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` from the end of the string (`ma`). The function returns the difference between these positions plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `mi` is 0, and the function returns `ma + 2`. The function does not modify any external state or parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` and printing the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the strip, `m`, and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, and `c` and `d` to 0. These variables are used to track the positions of the first and last black cells in the strip.
   - The first loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right:
     - It increments `c` for each cell.
     - If it encounters a black cell ('B'), it sets `mi` to the current position `c` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The second loop iterates over the string `s` from right to left:
     - It increments `d` for each cell.
     - If it encounters a black cell ('B'), it sets `ma` to the length of the string minus `d` (which gives the position of the last black cell from the left) and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`, which is supposed to be the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic of finding the first and last black cells is correct.
   - However, the calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment length is inclusive of both endpoints.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the strip has only one black cell, the program will correctly identify the position of that cell and return 1.
   - If the strip has black cells at both ends, the program will correctly identify the positions of the first and last black cells and return the correct segment length.

5. **Correction:**
   - The correct return statement should be `return ma - mi + 1` to account for the inclusive nature of the segment length.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is **incorrect** because it returns an incorrect segment length due to the mistake in the calculation.

Correctness: **False**
