The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value as specified in the annotated code. However, it reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the user input. It calculates the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` (`mi`) and the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` from the end of the string (`ma`). The function returns the difference between these positions plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `mi` is 0, and the function returns `ma + 2`. The function does not modify any external state or parameters.
