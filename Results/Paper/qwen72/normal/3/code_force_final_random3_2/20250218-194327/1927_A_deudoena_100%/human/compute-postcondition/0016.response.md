The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the second character of `s`, and `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be set to the next character in `s`, which is the third character, and `s` must still have at least three characters for the loop to continue.

State: **`c` is 2, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least three characters, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the list of tuples is unchanged, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character of `s`, `mi` remains 0 unless `j` is 'B', in which case `mi` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
