### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the strip, `m`, and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, and `c` and `d` to 0. These variables are used to track the positions of the first and last black cells in the strip.
   - The first loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right:
     - It increments `c` for each cell.
     - If it encounters a black cell ('B'), it sets `mi` to the current position `c` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The second loop iterates over the string `s` from right to left:
     - It increments `d` for each cell.
     - If it encounters a black cell ('B'), it sets `ma` to the length of the string minus `d` (which gives the position of the last black cell from the left) and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic of finding the first and last black cells is correct.
   - However, the calculation `ma - mi + 2` is indeed incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment length is inclusive of both endpoints.
   - For example, if the first black cell is at position 2 and the last black cell is at position 5, the segment length should be `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`, not `5 - 2 + 2 = 5`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the strip has only one black cell, the program will correctly identify the position of that cell and return 1 (since `ma` and `mi` will be the same, and `ma - mi + 2` will be 1).
   - If the strip has black cells at both ends, the program will correctly identify the positions of the first and last black cells but will return an incorrect segment length due to the `+ 2` in the calculation.

5. **Correction:**
   - The correct return statement should be `return ma - mi + 1` to account for the inclusive nature of the segment length.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is **incorrect** because it returns an incorrect segment length due to the mistake in the calculation.

Final: **False**
