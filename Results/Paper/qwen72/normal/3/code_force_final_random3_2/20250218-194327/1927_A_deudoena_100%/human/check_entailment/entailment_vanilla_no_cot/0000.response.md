Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not always compute the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The logic in `func_1` is flawed in the way it calculates the minimum and maximum indices of the black cells. Specifically, the calculation `ma - mi + 2` does not correctly account for the length of the segment that needs to be painted.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    if first_black == -1:  # If there are no black cells
        return 0
    return last_black - first_black + 1
```

This corrected version finds the first and last positions of the black cells and calculates the length of the segment that needs to be painted as `last_black - first_black + 1`. This ensures that the entire segment from the first to the last black cell is painted, which is the minimum length required to make the entire strip white.
