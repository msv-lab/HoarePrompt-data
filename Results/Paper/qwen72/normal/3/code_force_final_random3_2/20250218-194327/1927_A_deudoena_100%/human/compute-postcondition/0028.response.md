The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates over the string `s` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the first character in the reversed string `s` (which is the last character in the original string `s`), and `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next character in the reversed string `s`, which is the second-to-last character in the original string `s`. The string `s` remains unchanged.

State: **`c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found, `d` is 1, `ma` is 0 if `j` is not 'B' or `len(s) - 1` if `j` is 'B', `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or 0 if 'B' is not found, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the list of tuples is unchanged, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the second-to-last character in `s`**.
