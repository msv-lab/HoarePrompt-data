You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' or 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or 0 if 'B' is not found, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the list of tuples is unchanged, `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found, `d` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string plus 1, `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or 0 if 'B' is not found, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the list of tuples is unchanged, `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string (`ma`) and the position of the first 'B' in `s` (`mi`), plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `mi` is 0, and the program returns `ma + 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with at least one 'B'. It returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' from the end of the string and the position of the first 'B', plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, it returns the position of the last 'B' from the end of the string plus 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string (`ma`) and the position of the first 'B' in `s` (`mi`), plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `mi` is 0, and the program returns `ma + 2`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
