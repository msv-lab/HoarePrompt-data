### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, but it does not take any parameters, which is a mismatch with the problem description.

2. **Finding the First and Last 'B'**:
   - The program uses two loops to find the position of the first 'B' (`mi`) and the last 'B' (`ma`) in the string `s`.
   - The first loop iterates from the start of the string and sets `mi` to the position of the first 'B' encountered.
   - The second loop iterates from the end of the string and sets `ma` to the position of the last 'B' encountered.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The program calculates the length of the segment to be painted as `ma - mi + 2`.
   - This formula is incorrect because it adds 2 to the difference between the positions of the first and last 'B'. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to account for the inclusive range of the segment.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string `s` contains only one 'B', the program will return `2` instead of `1`.
   - If the string `s` contains no 'B' (which is not possible according to the problem constraints), the program will return `ma + 2` which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the calculation of the minimum segment length. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` instead of `ma - mi + 2`. Additionally, the function `func_1` should take the input parameters as described in the problem statement, but it currently does not. These issues make the program incorrect.
