The function `func` accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `m`. These parameters are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18, representing the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky, respectively. The function returns the number of times both installations launch fireworks simultaneously within the visibility time `m`.
