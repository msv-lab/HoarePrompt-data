The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where `a` and `b` are the frequencies of launching for two installations, and `m` is the time the firework is visible. It calculates the number of times each installation launches fireworks within the visibility time `m` and prints the sum of these counts for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
