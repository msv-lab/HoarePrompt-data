Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is undefined.**

The value of `A` is now `int(m / a) + 1`, which is the result of dividing `m` by `a`, converting the result to an integer, and then adding 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
