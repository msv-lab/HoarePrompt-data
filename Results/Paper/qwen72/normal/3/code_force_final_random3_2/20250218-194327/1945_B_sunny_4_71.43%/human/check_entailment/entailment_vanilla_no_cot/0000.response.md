Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` but does not consider the overlap of visibility times between fireworks from both installations. The correct approach should consider the visibility overlap to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration
        A = (m + a) // a
        B = (m + b) // b
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks
        max_simultaneous = max(A, B)
        
        # Check for the possibility of both installations launching fireworks at the same time
        lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        if (m + 1) >= lcm:
            max_simultaneous = max(max_simultaneous, A + B - 1)
        
        print(max_simultaneous)

# Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD)
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Number of Fireworks Launched**: The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m + 1` minutes. This is done using integer division to count the number of multiples of `a` and `b` within the range `[0, m + 1]`.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**: The initial maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is the maximum of the two counts (`A` and `B`). This is because at any given time, the maximum number of fireworks visible is at least the number of fireworks launched by the more frequent installation.

3. **Overlap Check**: The program then checks if both installations can launch fireworks at the same time within the visibility duration. This is done by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and checking if `m + 1` is greater than or equal to this LCM. If so, the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is adjusted to account for the overlap.

4. **GCD Function**: The `gcd` function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor, which is necessary for computing the LCM.

This corrected program should handle the problem as described and produce the correct output for the given test cases.
