The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to adjust `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**
