Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**

The value of `B` is now defined and set to `int(m / b) + 1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, and `A` retains its value of `int(m / a) + 1`.
