The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, and it does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
