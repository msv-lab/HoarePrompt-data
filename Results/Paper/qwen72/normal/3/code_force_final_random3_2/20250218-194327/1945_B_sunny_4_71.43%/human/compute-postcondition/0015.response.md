Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet, it is a precondition).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(A + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `A`**:
   - `A` is defined as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `int(m / a)` performs integer division of `m` by `a`, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
   - Adding 1 to this result gives the value of `A`.

2. **Calculate `B`**:
   - `B` is defined as `int(m / b) + 1`.
   - `int(m / b)` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
   - Adding 1 to this result gives the value of `B`.

3. **Sum `A` and `B`**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the sum of `A` and `B`, where:
- `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `A + B`. However, based on the given formulas, the output will be the sum of these two values.

Output: **A + B (where A is int(m / a) + 1 and B is int(m / b) + 1)**
