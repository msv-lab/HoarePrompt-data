The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i < n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still satisfy the condition `n - 1 > i`.

Given that `i` is 1, the next value of `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n - 1` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements, and `u` has been appended to `nodes[v]` again.**
