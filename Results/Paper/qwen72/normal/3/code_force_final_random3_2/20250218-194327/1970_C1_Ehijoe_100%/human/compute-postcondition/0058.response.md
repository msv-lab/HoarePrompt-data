Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were traversed, with `e` now appended to the end of the list, `prev` is the node immediately before `e` in the traversal, `curr` is equal to `e`, `start` is an input integer.**
