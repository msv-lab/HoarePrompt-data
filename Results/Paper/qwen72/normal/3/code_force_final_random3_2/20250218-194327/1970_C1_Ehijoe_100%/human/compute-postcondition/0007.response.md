Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, `nodes[u]` still includes `v` as one of its elements, and now `nodes[v]` also includes `u` as one of its elements.
