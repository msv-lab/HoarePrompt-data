Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with at least one key, `key` is the first key in `nodes`, `empty` remains `True`. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list containing the first key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.***
