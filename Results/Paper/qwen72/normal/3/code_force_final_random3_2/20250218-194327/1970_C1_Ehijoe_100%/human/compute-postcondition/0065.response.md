Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were traversed, with `e` now appended to the end of the list, `prev` is the node immediately before `e` in the traversal, `curr` is equal to `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, then the program follows the if part. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even, and the program follows the else part.***
