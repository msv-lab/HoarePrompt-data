Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list where each key (node) has a list of its connected nodes (edges), and each node `u` and `v` that were input during the loop execution are appended to each other's lists. `empty` remains `True` since it is not modified within the loop. `ends` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        ends.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with at least one key, `key` is the first key in `nodes`, `empty` remains `True`. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list containing the first key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with at least two keys, `key` is the second key in `nodes`, `empty` remains `True`, and `ends` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list that now includes the second key in `nodes`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with at least three keys, `key` is the third key in `nodes`, `empty` remains `True`, and `ends` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list that now includes the second key in `nodes` and the third key in `nodes`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
