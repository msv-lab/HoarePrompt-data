The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the loop runs `n - 1` times, and if `n` is 1, `n - 1` would be 0, and the loop would not execute. The variable `i` starts at 0 before the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
