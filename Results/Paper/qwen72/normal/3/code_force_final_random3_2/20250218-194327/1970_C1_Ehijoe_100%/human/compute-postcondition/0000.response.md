Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input through standard input, where the first line contains two integers `n` and `t`, with 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5 and `t` = 1. The next `n-1` lines contain two integers `u` and `v` each, representing edges of the tree, with 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`. The last line contains a single integer `u_1`, representing the starting node, with 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n`. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `n` and `t` are now integers, with `t` = 1 and `n` in the range 2 to 2×10^5.**
