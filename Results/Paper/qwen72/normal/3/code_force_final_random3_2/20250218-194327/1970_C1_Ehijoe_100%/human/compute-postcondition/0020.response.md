Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with at least one key, `key` is the first key in `nodes`, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing the first key in `nodes`.**

The code snippet `ends.append(key)` adds the value of `key` to the list `ends`. Since `key` is the first key in `nodes`, `ends` now contains this key. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
