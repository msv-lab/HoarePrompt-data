Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends`, `prev` is the first element of `ends`, `curr` is the first element in the list `nodes[s]`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` and the new `curr`, `prev` is now equal to the previous `curr`, and `nodes[s]` contains at least one element that is not `e`. If `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, `curr` is now the second element of `nodes[curr]`. Otherwise, `curr` is now the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` that is not equal to `prev`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends`, the previous `curr`, and the new `curr`, `nodes[s]` contains at least one element that is not `e`, `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is updated to the first or second element of `nodes[curr]` depending on whether the first element equals `prev`. In both cases, `curr` is not equal to `e`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends`, the previous `curr`, the new `curr`, and the updated `curr`, `nodes[s]` contains at least one element that is not `e`, `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is updated to either the first or second element of `nodes[curr]` depending on whether the first element equals `prev`. In both cases, `curr` is not equal to `e`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
