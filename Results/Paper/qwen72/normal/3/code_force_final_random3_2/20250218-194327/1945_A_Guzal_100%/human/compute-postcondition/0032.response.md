The function `func` accepts parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`. These parameters are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters, so it is incomplete. Assuming the function signature should include these parameters, the functionality of the function would need to be described based on the output cases provided. Since no specific output cases are provided in the task, I will assume a generic case where the function returns a value based on the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
