Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of iterations to perform. For each of the `n` iterations, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `k` as `a + (b + c) // 3` and increments `k` by 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. It then prints the value of `k`. After all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained for subsequent iterations. The function does not return any value. **
