Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, `k` remains 0. Otherwise, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is set to `1 + a + (b + c) // 3`. If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`.***
