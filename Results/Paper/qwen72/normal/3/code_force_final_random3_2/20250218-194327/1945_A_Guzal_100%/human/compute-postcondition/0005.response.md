The `print(-1)` statement will print the integer `-1`.

Based on the precondition, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is not divisible by 3, and the sum of the remainder of `b` divided by 3 and `c` is less than 3. However, none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement simply prints the constant integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
