Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `k` was `a + (b + c) // 3`, so after the increment, `k` becomes `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
