Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all the constraints and conditions of the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals**: The program attempts to determine if it's possible to accommodate the extroverts and universals by checking if `b % 3 + c < 3`. This condition is not sufficient to ensure that all extroverts can be paired with two others. It only checks if the remainder of `b` when divided by 3 plus `c` is less than 3, which is not a complete check for the possibility of forming groups of three.

2. **Calculation of Tents**: The program calculates the number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3` and then adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the specific requirements of introverts and extroverts.

3. **Correct Logic**: The correct logic should be:
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent.
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. If there are not enough universals to pair with the extroverts, it should return -1.
   - After accommodating the extroverts, the remaining universals can be placed in tents in any configuration.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Each introvert needs a separate tent
        tents = a
        
        # Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others
        if c >= 2 * b:
            tents += b  # Each extrovert can be paired with two universals
            c -= 2 * b
        elif c >= b:
            tents += b  # Each extrovert can be paired with one universal and one other extrovert
            c -= b
            b = 0
        else:
            # Not enough universals to pair with extroverts
            if c < b:
                print(-1)
                continue
            else:
                # Pair extroverts with universals and each other
                tents += c // 2
                b -= c // 2
                c = c % 2
                if b % 3 != 0:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
                else:
                    tents += b // 3
        
        # Remaining universals can be placed in any configuration
        if c > 0:
            tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        print(tents)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Each introvert is given a separate tent.
- Each extrovert is paired with two others, either universals or other extroverts.
- If it's impossible to pair all extroverts, it returns -1.
- The remaining universals are placed in tents in the most efficient way.
