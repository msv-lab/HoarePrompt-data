### Reasoning:

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must be in a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is simply `a`.

2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Since each tent can accommodate up to 3 people, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3`. However, if there are any remaining extroverts (`b % 3 != 0`), they need to be paired with universals. If there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, it is impossible to accommodate them, and the function should print `-1`.

3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in any tent, so they can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. If there are any remaining universals after accommodating the extroverts, they can be placed in their own tents or in tents with other universals.

4. **Calculation**:
   - First, the function checks if it is possible to accommodate the extroverts. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, and the function prints `-1`.
   - If it is possible to accommodate the extroverts, the function calculates the number of tents needed for introverts and extroverts as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
   - If there are any remaining universals after this calculation (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), an additional tent is needed to accommodate them.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`, the function correctly prints `0` because no tents are needed.
   - If `a = 0` and `b` is a multiple of 3, the function correctly prints `b // 3` because all extroverts can be accommodated in full tents.
   - If `a = 0` and `b` is not a multiple of 3, the function correctly checks if there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts and prints `-1` if not.

6. **General Case**:
   - The function correctly handles the general case where there are introverts, extroverts, and universals. It ensures that all extroverts are paired with others and that any remaining universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, and it handles all edge cases and general cases as described in the problem.
