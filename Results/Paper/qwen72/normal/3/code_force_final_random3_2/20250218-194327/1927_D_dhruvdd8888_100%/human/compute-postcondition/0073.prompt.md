Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `N + 1`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, `s` is `N`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` > `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`. If `s` ≤ `l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, then `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` > `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`. If `s` ≤ `l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, then `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, and the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is ignored. If `s` > `l`, the program behaves as described in the precondition. If `s` is 1 or `s` > `r`, the program behaves as described in the precondition. If `s` ≤ `l`, and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`, the state of the variables also remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
