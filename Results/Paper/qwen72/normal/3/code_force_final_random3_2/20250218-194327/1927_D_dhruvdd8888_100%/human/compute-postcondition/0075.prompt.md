You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the length of `a` is 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The number of test cases `t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the total number of queries across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `i` is `N + 1`, `num` is the last element in `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, and `s` is `N`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `int(input())` times, and for each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` will have been provided by the user input. The values of `s` and `e` will be determined by the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, where `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The state of `arr`, `N`, and `LA` will remain unchanged. The loop will print a pair of integers based on the conditions described in the loop body, and these conditions will be evaluated for each pair of `l` and `r` provided.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of `a`, and a list of queries `q`. Each query in `q` is a tuple `(l, r)` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the outcome of an operation performed on the sublist `a[l:r+1]` for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
