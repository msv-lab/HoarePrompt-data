Postcondition: ***`s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, and the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is ignored. If `s` is 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, the program behaves as described in the precondition. Otherwise, the program also behaves as described in the precondition.***
