Output State: **`i` is `N + 1`, `num` is the last element in `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, and `s` is `N`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `N + 1`**: The loop iterates from `0` to `N` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be `N + 1`.
- **`num` is the last element in `nums` (which is `-1`)**: The loop updates `num` to `nums[i]` at the end of each iteration. Since `nums` has an extra `-1` appended at the end, the last value of `num` will be `-1`.
- **`arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal**: The loop appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr` whenever it encounters a different element in `nums`. This means that `arr` will contain tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a range of consecutive elements that are equal, along with the value of the element in that range.
- **`s` is `N`**: The variable `s` is updated to the current index `i` whenever a different element is found. After the loop finishes, `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums`, which is `N`.
