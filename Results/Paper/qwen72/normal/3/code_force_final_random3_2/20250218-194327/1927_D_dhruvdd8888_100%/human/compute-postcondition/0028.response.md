Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is split into two parts and each part is converted to an integer.

```
eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

- The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to find the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- The value of `eli` is determined by the position where `(l, 0, 0)` would fit in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
- The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is still valid.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.**
