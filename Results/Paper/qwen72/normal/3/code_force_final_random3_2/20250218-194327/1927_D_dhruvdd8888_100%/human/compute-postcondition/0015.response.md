Output State: **`i` is 1, `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1, 1, num)` at the end, and `s` is 0.** 

The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Since `s` is 0, `i` is 1, and `num` is equal to `nums[0]`, the new tuple appended to `arr` is `(1, 1, num)`. The values of `i`, `N`, `num`, and `s` remain unchanged.
