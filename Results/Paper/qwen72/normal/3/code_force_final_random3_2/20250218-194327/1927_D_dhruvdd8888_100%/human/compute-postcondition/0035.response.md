Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, the value of `s` is greater than `l`. If `s` is 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`.***
