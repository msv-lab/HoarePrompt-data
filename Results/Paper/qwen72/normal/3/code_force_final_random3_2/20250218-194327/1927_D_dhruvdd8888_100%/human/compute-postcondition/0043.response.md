Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
2. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
3. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
4. `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
5. `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
6. `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
7. `e` is less than `r`.
8. `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.
9. `e` is greater than or equal to `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
- The initial state provides conditions and values for variables `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, and `e`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same values regardless of the conditions provided.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
