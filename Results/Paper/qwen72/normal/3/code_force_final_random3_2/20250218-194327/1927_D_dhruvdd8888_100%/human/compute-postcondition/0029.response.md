Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.

Code:
```
s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. `min(eli, LA)` is evaluated to determine the index to use for accessing `arr`.
2. The tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is unpacked into `s`, `e`, and `_`.
3. The underscore `_` is used to discard the third element of the tuple.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.**
