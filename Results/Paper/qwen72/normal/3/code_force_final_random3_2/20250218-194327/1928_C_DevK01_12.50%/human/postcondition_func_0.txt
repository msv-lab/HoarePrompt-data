The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` such that `1 <= x < q <= 10^9`. It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` (including `q` itself) that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `q` is a perfect square and its square root is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the square root is also included in the list. The list `M` may be empty if no such divisors exist.
