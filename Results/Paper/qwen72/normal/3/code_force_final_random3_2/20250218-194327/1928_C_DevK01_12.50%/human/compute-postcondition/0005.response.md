To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions provided:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))`.
   - The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(w // 1)` is non-empty, which means `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1.

2. **State Before the Loop**:
   - `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
   - `M` is an empty list if `w` is not an integer or `w` is less than `x - 1`.
   - If `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list containing the integer `w`, and `w` is the square root of `q`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1.
   - This implies that `w` must be an integer and `w` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than 1.
   - Given that `w` is the square root of `q`, `q` must be a perfect square and its square root must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `q` must be at least 4 (since \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \)).

5. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is at least 4.
   - `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1 (the starting value of the range).

Given these conditions, the adjusted state is:

State: **`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
