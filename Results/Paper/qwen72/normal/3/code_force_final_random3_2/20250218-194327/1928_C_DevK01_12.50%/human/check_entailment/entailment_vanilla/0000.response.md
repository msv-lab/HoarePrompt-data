### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - For \( k = 2 \), the pattern is \( 1, 2, 1, 2, \ldots \).
   - For \( k = 3 \), the pattern is \( 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, \ldots \).
   - For \( k = 5 \), the pattern is \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, \ldots \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received must fit the pattern.
   - The pattern can be described by the sequence \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, \ldots, 2 \).
   - The length of one complete cycle is \( 2k - 2 \).
   - Vasya's position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should give a valid position in the cycle.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1` with \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It also checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and if so, calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two arguments \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates \( w = \sqrt{q} \).
   - If \( w \) is an integer and \( w \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( w \) to \( M \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \lfloor w \rfloor \) and checks if \( q \) is divisible by \( i \).
   - If \( q \) is divisible by \( i \), it adds \( i \) to \( M \) if \( i \geq x - 1 \).
   - It also adds \( q // i \) to \( M \) if \( q // i \geq x - 1 \).
   - It returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and the use of `func_1` to find divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) is a valid approach to find possible \( k \) values.
   - The additional check for \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and the second call to `func_1` is necessary to cover all possible \( k \) values.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates and the final length calculation is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
