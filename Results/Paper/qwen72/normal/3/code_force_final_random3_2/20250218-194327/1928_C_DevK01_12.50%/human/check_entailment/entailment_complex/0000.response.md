### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern is such that the first \( k \) positions are numbered \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), followed by \( k - 2 \) positions numbered \( k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1(q, x)`.
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and if so, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` and adds the results to \( L1 \).
   - It converts \( L1 \) to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two integers \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds the square root to \( M \).
   - It then iterates over all integers from 1 to \( \lfloor \sqrt{q} \rfloor \) and checks if they are divisors of \( q \). If a divisor \( i \) is greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \), it adds \( i \) to \( M \). Similarly, if \( q // i \) is greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \), it adds \( q // i \) to \( M \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0 and continuing to the next test case.
   - The calculation of \( q \) is correct and follows the logic of the problem.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - The program correctly combines the results from two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.
   - The program prints the correct number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and logic. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
