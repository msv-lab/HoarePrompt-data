Output State: **`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `M` is a list containing `[1]`, and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.** 

The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `M`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
