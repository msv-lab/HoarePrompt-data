Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i] < A[i+1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` must have at least one element, `f` is the first element in `F`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where the first element greater than `left - f` is found.**

Explanation:
- The variable `l` is assigned the result of `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, which finds the index in the sorted list `D` where the first element greater than `left - f` is located.
- All other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `f`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `ans`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
