Output State: **`total` is 0, `f` is the first value in `F`, `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` retains its initial value.**

Explanation:
- `mid_sum` is assigned the value of `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is assigned the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`.
- All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by the code snippet.
