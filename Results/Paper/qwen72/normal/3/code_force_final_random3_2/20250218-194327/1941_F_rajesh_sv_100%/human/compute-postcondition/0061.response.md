Postcondition: ***The loop has finished executing, and `l` is equal to `h`. The variable `mid` is the final index where `l` and `h` converge, and `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`. If `l` is equal to `h`, the variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value `max_diff` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `f`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state.***
