Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9. `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` is now equal to the list returned by `func_4()`. `max_diff` is set to negative infinity, `next_max_diff` is set to negative infinity, and `index` is set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        next_max_diff = max_diff
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` is now equal to the list returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]`, `next_max_diff` is set to negative infinity, and `index` is set to 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains negative infinity, `index` remains `None`, and if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i] < A[i+1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` is now equal to the list returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is set to `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is set to `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is set to `A[2] - A[1]`, and `index` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains the same, `index` remains the same, and if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is set to `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` <= `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i] < A[i+1]`, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` is now equal to the list returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is set to `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is set to `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is set to the previous value of `max_diff`, and `index` is set to 3. If `diff` <= `max_diff` and `diff` > `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is set to `A[3] - A[2]`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains the same, `next_max_diff` remains the same, and `index` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
