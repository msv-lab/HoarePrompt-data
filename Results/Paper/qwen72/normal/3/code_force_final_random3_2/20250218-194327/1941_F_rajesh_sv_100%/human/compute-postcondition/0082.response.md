Output State: **`total` is 0, `f` is the first value in `F`, `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` retains its initial value.**

The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, while all other variables retain their initial values or relationships. The new value of `l` is `mid + 1`, and the value of `mid` is still calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
