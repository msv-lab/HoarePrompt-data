The only variable in the loop head is the anonymous variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head, but they are part of the initial state provided. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input to the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is even, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
