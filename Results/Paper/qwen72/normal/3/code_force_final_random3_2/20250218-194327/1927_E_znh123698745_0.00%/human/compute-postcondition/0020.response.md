Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `answer` is a list that now includes the last element of `array`.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the last element of `array` to the list `answer`. The last element of `array` is `n` (since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive). Therefore, `answer` now contains the value `n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
