Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `_` is 0.
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1.
- `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*answer)
```

### Explanation:
- The `answer` list is described as containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1. This means the list will look like:
  - If `n` is 4, `answer` will be `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.
  - If `n` is 5, `answer` will be `[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]`.
  - If `n` is 6, `answer` will be `[1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]`.

- The `print(*answer)` statement will unpack the `answer` list and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list in the order they appear, separated by spaces. The `answer` list contains the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1.

Output: **1 3 5 ... 2 4 6 (where the list contains integers from 1 to n in alternating order starting with 1)**

This output will vary depending on the value of `n`, but the pattern will always be the same: start with 1, then alternate between odd and even numbers until all numbers from 1 to `n` are included.
