### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `k` is even.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It starts with an initial `answer` list containing the integer 1.
   - It uses a list `a` to keep track of the indices from which to pick the next element in the permutation. The list `a` is initialized with `[1, -1]`.

3. **Alternating Pattern**:
   - The function iterates from 1 to `n-1` and appends elements to `answer` in an alternating pattern.
   - If `(-1) ** i` is -1, it appends the element from the end of `array` (i.e., `a[-1]`), and decrements `a[-1]`.
   - If `(-1) ** i` is 1, it appends the element from the start of `array` (i.e., `a[0]`), and increments `a[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Initial Setup**:
  - The `array` is correctly initialized with integers from 1 to `n`.
  - The `answer` list starts with the integer 1, which is a valid starting point for a permutation.

- **Alternating Pattern**:
  - The alternating pattern ensures that elements are picked from both ends of the `array` in a way that maintains the k-level property.
  - The use of `(-1) ** i` to alternate between picking from the start and the end of the `array` is a clever way to achieve this.

- **k-Level Property**:
  - The k-level property requires that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
  - The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced. For example, if `k` is 2, the sums of consecutive pairs will be close to each other because the pattern alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 2 and `k` is 2 correctly by outputting `[2, 1]`.
  - It also handles larger values of `n` and `k` by maintaining the alternating pattern.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given constraints. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, which satisfies the k-level property.

### Correctness:
**True**
