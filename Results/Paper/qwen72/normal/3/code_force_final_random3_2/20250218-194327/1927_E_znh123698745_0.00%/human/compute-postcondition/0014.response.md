The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `answer` and `a`. Assuming `answer` is an existing list and `a` is a list or sequence with at least one element, the following steps are taken:

1. `a[-1]` accesses the last element of the list `a`.
2. `array[a[-1]]` accesses the element in `array` at the index specified by `a[-1]`.
3. This value is then appended to the list `answer`.

Since the specific values of `a` and `answer` are not provided, we can only state that the last element of `a` is used to index into `array`, and the corresponding value is appended to `answer`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` has been appended with the value of `array[a[-1]]`.**
