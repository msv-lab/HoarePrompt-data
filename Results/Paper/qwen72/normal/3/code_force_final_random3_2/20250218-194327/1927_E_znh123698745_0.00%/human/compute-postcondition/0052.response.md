Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 3, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, and `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`. If `i` is odd (`i == 3`), `answer` also contains the value of `array[a[-1]]` twice, or 1, `array[-1]`, `array[a[0]]`, and `array[a[-1]]` depending on the condition, and `a[-1]` is `a[-1] - 1`. If `i` is even, `answer` also contains `array[a[0]]`, and `a[0]` is 2.***
