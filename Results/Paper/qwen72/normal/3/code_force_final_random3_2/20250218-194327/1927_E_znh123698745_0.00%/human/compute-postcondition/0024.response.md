Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list that includes the last element of `array`, which is `n - 1`. If `i` is even, `array` is modified so that its first element is now `2`, and `answer` is a list containing this first element.***
