Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1, `array[-1]`], `a` is [2, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. Since `a[-1]` is `-1`, it refers to the last element of the `array`. The last element of `array` is `n` because `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Therefore, `answer` now contains the integers [1, 1, `n`]. The other variables remain unchanged.
