Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, `array`[-1]], `a` is [1, -2].**

The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` is [1, -1], so after the decrement, `a` becomes [1, -2]. All other variables remain unchanged.
