Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input. This aligns with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then constructs the permutation `answer` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements in `array`.
   - The alternating pattern is controlled by the list `a`, which keeps track of the current indices to pick from the `array`.

3. **Alternating Pattern**:
   - The function uses the expression `(-1) ** i` to determine whether to pick the next smallest or largest element.
   - When `(-1) ** i` is -1, it appends the largest remaining element (tracked by `a[-1]` and decremented).
   - When `(-1) ** i` is 1, it appends the smallest remaining element (tracked by `a[0]` and incremented).

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed permutation for each test case, which is the required output format.

5. **k-Level Permutation**:
   - The constructed permutation alternates between the smallest and largest elements, which helps in balancing the sums of continuous segments of length `k`.
   - For an even `k`, the alternating pattern ensures that the sums of any two consecutive segments of length `k` differ by at most 1. This is because the difference between the sums of two such segments is primarily influenced by the alternation of the largest and smallest elements, which are close to each other in value.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the smallest possible values of `n` and `k` (e.g., `n = 2`, `k = 2`) correctly.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly generate a k-level permutation for each test case as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
