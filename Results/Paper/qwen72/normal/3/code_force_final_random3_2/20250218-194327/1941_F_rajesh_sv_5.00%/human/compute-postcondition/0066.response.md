Output State: **`l` is now equal to `mid + 1`, `h` is one index greater than `l`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `f`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is updated to be one index greater than its previous value, which was equal to `mid`. As a result, `l` is now equal to `mid + 1`, and `h` remains one index greater than `l`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
