Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is now equal to `mid`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to be equal to `mid`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum` still hold true.
