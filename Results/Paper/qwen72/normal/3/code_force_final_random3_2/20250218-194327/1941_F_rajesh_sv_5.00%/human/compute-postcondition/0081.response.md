Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `h` is one index greater than `l`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.**
