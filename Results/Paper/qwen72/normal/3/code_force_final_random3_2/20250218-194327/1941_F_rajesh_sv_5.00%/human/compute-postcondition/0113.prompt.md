Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9), `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9), `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has finished executing, and the variables `l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, and `l` is equal to `h`. `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`l` is equal to `h`, and both `l` and `h` are the index of the element in `D` that is closest to the midpoint between `left - f` and `right - f`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
