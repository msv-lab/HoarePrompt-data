The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `testcases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `testcases` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, but it does not specify the value of `testcases`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**
