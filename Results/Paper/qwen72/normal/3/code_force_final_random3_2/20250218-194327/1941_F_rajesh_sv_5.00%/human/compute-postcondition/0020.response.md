Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9), `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9), `max_diff` is -infinity, `next_max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `index` is None, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`.***
