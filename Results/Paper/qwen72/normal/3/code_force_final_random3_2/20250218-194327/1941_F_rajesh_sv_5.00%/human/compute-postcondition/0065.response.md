Postcondition: **`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is now one index greater than `l`. `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged. `f` is the first element in `F`. `mid` is equal to `l`. `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. The difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`.**
