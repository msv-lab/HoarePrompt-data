You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` from the input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`, and prints the integer division of `x` by 2. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the result of `x // 2` has been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always find the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). The program outputs \( y = 5 \), but the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(10, y) + y \) is \( y = 6 \), because \( \gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \), which is greater than \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \). The program simply outputs \( x // 2 \) without considering the gcd condition, which can lead to incorrect results for many inputs.
