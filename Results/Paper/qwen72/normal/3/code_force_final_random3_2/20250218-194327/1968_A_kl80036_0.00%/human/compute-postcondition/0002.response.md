Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())` which is greater than 0, `y` is assigned the value of `x // 2` which is the integer division of `x` by 2.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000. For each of the `t` test cases, `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and it is assigned the value of an integer input which is greater than 0. The variable `y` is now assigned the value of `x` divided by 2, using integer division, which means `y` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.
