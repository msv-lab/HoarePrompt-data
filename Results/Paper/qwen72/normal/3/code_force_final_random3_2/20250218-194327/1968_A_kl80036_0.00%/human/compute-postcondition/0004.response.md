The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can consider as a new value for `t` (the number of test cases). The loop will execute again if `i` is less than this new value of `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())` which is greater than 0, and `y` is assigned the value of `x // 2` which is the integer division of `x` by 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the new value of `t` must be greater than the incremented `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x // 2`, `i` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1** 

(Note: The state of `x` and `y` are not adjusted because they are not part of the loop head. The state of `i` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `t` must be greater than this incremented `i` for the loop to continue.)
