Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an input integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x // 2`, `i` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

The value of `y` is updated to be the integer division of `x` by 2, which means `y` is now equal to `x // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
