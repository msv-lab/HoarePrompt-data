Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This means `t` represents the number of test cases.
   - For each of the `t` test cases:
     - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\). This means `x` is a positive integer within the specified range.
     - `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a user-provided integer greater than 0.
     - `y` is assigned the value of `x // 2`, which is the integer division of `x` by 2. This means `y` will be the largest integer less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{2} \).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - For each test case, the user provides an integer `x` within the range \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - The variable `y` is then calculated as `x // 2`, which is the integer division of `x` by 2.
   - The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y` for each test case.

4. **Output**:
   - Since `x` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `y` will be an integer within the range \(1 \leq y \leq 500\).
   - The exact value of `y` for each test case will depend on the user input for `x`.

Therefore, the output for each test case will be the integer value of `y` calculated as `x // 2`.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2, and x is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= x <= 1000)**
