Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an input integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x // 2`, `i` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

The value of `x` is updated to a new input integer within the range 2 to 1000. The value of `y` is recalculated as `x // 2` based on the new value of `x`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
