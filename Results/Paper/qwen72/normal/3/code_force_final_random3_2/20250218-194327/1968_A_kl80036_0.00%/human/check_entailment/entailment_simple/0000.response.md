### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and outputs \( y = x // 2 \).

2. **GCD Analysis**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest number that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.
   - For \( y = x // 2 \), \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a multiple of 2 (if \( x \) is even) or the largest integer less than \( x \) that is half of \( x \) (if \( x \) is odd).

3. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - If \( x \) is even, \( y = x // 2 \) is exactly half of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = y \). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2y \).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is half of \( x \). The GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) will be 1 (since \( y \) is not a multiple of \( x \) and \( x \) is odd). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + y \).

4. **Checking the Output**:
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is a valid choice because it maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) as \( 2y \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is also a valid choice because it maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) as \( 1 + y \).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 5 \) (since \( 10 // 2 = 5 \)). \( \gcd(10, 5) = 5 \), so \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \) (since \( 7 // 2 = 3 \)). \( \gcd(7, 3) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 10 \) (since \( 21 // 2 = 10 \)). \( \gcd(21, 10) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 11 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 50 \) (since \( 100 // 2 = 50 \)). \( \gcd(100, 50) = 50 \), so \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \) (since \( 2 // 2 = 1 \)). \( \gcd(2, 1) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 500 \) (since \( 1000 // 2 = 500 \)). \( \gcd(1000, 500) = 500 \), so \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \) (since \( 6 // 2 = 3 \)). \( \gcd(6, 3) = 3 \), so \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly outputs \( y = x // 2 \) for each test case, which is a valid choice that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) based on the problem description.
