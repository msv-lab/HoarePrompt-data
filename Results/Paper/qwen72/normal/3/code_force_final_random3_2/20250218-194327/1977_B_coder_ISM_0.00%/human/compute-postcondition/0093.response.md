The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the sequence `range(30)`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than 30. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The sequence `range(30)` does not change.

State: **`i` is 1, `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 0 of `x` is set (i.e., `x` is an odd number), `s` now contains the string `'1'` as its last element. Otherwise, `s` now contains the string `'0'` as its last element.**
