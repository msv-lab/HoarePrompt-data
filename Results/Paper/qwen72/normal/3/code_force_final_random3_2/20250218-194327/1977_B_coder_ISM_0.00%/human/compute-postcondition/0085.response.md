Output State: **`i` is 28, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is an empty list, `nalla` is 29, `t` must be greater than 29, `x` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `s = []` reassigns the variable `s` to an empty list, overriding its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
