Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 2 in `x` is set to 1, `s` is a list containing the strings '1', '1', and '1'. If the bit at position 2 in `x` is 0, and the bit at position 1 in `x` is set to 1, `s` is a list containing the strings '1', '1', and '0'. If the bit at position 2 in `x` is 0, and the bit at position 1 in `x` is 0, and the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1, `s` is a list containing the strings '0', '1', and '0'. If the bit at position 2 in `x` is 0, and the bit at position 1 in `x` is 0, and the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0, `s` is a list containing the strings '0', '0', and '0'.***
