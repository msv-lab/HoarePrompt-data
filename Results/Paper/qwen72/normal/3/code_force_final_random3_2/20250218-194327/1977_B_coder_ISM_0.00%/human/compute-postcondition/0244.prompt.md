Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`i` is 28, `length` is 30 or 31, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings representing the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit). If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', the 30th element of `s` (index 29) is now '1', and `flag` remains 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, the last element of `s` is '1' and `s[29]` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `s` retains its original 30 elements, and the `flag` remains 0. Additionally, either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31. If the first element of the string `s` is '-1' and the second element of the string `s` is '1', then the second element of the string `s` is updated to '0'. Otherwise, the string `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30 or 31. If the third element of the string `s` is '-1' and the second element is '1', then the second element of the string `s` is updated to '0'. Otherwise, the string `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `length` is 30 or 31, and if the third element of the string `s` is '-1' and the second element is '1', then the second element of `s` is updated to '0'. Otherwise, the string `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
