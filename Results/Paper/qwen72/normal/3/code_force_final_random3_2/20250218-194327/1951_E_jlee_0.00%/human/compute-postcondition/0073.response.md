Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, indicating that there exists an index `j` where `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was updated to `j`. If `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count` > 1, `count` is updated to the largest index `j` where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x` and is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, `count` remains 1, `done` remains False, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x` and is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. If `count2` is not equal to `count`, and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `count2` is not equal to `count`, and `done` remains False. The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`, and the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`.***
