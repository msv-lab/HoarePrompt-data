Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 4 characters, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 3, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is set to 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` retains its original value, `count2` is 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**
