Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`. If `count` > 1, `count2` is equal to `count`, `count` is updated to the largest index `j` where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x` and is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. If `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, `count` remains 1, `done` remains False, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x` and is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`.***
