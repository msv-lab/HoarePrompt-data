Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `x` appears exactly `n` times in `s`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. None of the variables are modified by this statement, so all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
