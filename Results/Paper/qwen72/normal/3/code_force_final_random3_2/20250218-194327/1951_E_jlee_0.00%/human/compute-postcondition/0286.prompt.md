Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0. If `s.count(x) == n`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `n` is 1, `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `count` is 0 or greater. If `count` > 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is greater than `count`. If `count2` is equal to `count`, `count2` is set to `count` if `count` > 1, otherwise `count2` is 0, and `done` is True if `count` > 1, otherwise `done` remains False. If `count` > 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1, and `done` remains False unless the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. If `count` is 0, `count2` remains 0 and `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 4 characters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 3, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` > 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 6 characters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 3, and `count2` retains its original value if `s[j]` equals `x`. If `s[j]` does not equal `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 3. If `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` retains its original value. Otherwise, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is set to 0 if `count` is not greater than 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and `count` retains its original value if it is less than 1 or if `s[j]` equals `x`. If `count` is greater than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
