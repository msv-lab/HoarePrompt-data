Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings. Here are the issues:

1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a string of length 1 cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO".

2. **Strings with All Characters the Same**: The program correctly identifies that a string where all characters are the same (e.g., "lllllllll") cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO".

3. **Strings with One Different Character**: The program attempts to handle strings where all but one character are the same (e.g., "lllllllllLllllllll"). However, it does not correctly identify all such cases. For example, if the different character is in the middle of an odd-length string, the program incorrectly prints "NO" instead of "YES".

4. **General Case**: The program's logic for handling general cases is overly complex and does not always produce the correct partition. For example, for the string "uwuowouwu", the program should be able to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, but it fails to do so correctly.

### Correct Approach
A simpler and more reliable approach to solve this problem is as follows:

- If the string length is 1, print "NO" because a single character is a palindrome.
- If the string length is 2, print "YES" and the string itself because a two-character string can always be partitioned into a single non-palindromic substring.
- For strings of length 3 or more, check if the string is a palindrome. If it is not, print "YES" and the string itself.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to partition it into two non-palindromic substrings. This can be done by finding the first character that is different from the first character and splitting the string at that point. If no such character exists, the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, and you should print "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if not is_palindrome(string):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        
        # Try to partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not is_palindrome(string[:i]) and not is_palindrome(string[i:]):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:i], string[i:])
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all cases and provides a valid partition when possible.
