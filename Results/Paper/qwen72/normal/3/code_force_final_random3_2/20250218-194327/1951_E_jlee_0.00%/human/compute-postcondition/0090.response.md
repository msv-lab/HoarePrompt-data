Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `count` is a non-negative integer.
- `count2` is a positive integer less than or equal to `count` with specific conditions.
- `j` is 1.

### Conditions:
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character and `n` is the length of `s` (which is greater than 1).

2. **Conditions:**
   - The conditions provided do not directly affect the `print` statement, but they influence the value of `j` and potentially other variables.
   - Since `j` is 1, we need to check the conditions to see if they change `j` or any other relevant variables.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The first condition checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If true, `count` is set to 1. However, this condition does not change `j`.
   - The second condition checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If true, `done` is set to True and we break out of the loop. This condition also does not change `j`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will split the `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` which is the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at index `j`.
     - `string[j:]` which is the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring from the second character to the end of `string`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
