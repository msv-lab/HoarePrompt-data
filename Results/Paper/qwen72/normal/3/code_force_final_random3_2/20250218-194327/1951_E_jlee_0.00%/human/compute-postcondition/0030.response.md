Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`. `x` is not equal to the last character of `s` if `n` is greater than 1, and `n` is not 1. Additionally, if `s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`, then if `n` is odd, the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, and if `n` is even or the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x)` is not equal to `n - 1`, the program state remains unchanged.***
