Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 4 characters.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `j`**: According to the initial state, `j` is 2.
2. **Value of `string[:j - 1]`**: This is a slice of the `string` from the start up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`. Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` is the first character of `string`.
3. **Value of `string[j - 1:]`**: This is a slice of the `string` starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string. Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. Therefore, `string[j - 1:]` is the substring of `string` starting from the second character to the end.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "hello", the output will be:
Output: **h ello**
