To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `count` is a non-negative integer.
   - `count2` is a positive integer less than or equal to `count` with specific conditions.
   - `(n + 1) // 2` must be greater than 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Given the initial state and conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because it does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided. The `print` statement simply prints the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
