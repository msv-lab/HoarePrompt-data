### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string `s` has a length of 1, it is a palindrome by definition. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

3. **Checking if the First and Last Characters are Different:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string `s` are different, the entire string is not a palindrome. The program correctly prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.

4. **Checking if All Characters are the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string `s` are the same, the string is a palindrome and any substring of it will also be a palindrome. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

5. **Checking if All but One Character are the Same:**
   - If all but one character in the string `s` are the same, the program checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If the string length is odd and the middle character is different, the program correctly prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition. This is correct because the string itself is not a palindrome if the middle character is the same as the others.

6. **General Case:**
   - For strings where the first and last characters are the same, the program attempts to find a partition where at least one substring is not a palindrome.
   - It iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are different.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition. This is incorrect because the string itself can still be a palindrome even if the first and last characters are the same.
   - The logic for splitting the string into two parts is overly complex and may not always produce the correct partition. For example, the string "abba" should be partitioned into "a" and "bba" or "ab" and "ba", but the program may not produce the correct partition in such cases.

### Detailed Analysis of the General Case:

- **First and Last Characters are the Same:**
  - The program should check if the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings.
  - The current logic is flawed because it only checks for the first pair of different characters and prints the entire string as a partition if such a pair is found. This is incorrect because the entire string can still be a palindrome.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - If the first and last characters are the same, the program should attempt to split the string into two parts such that at least one part is not a palindrome.
  - A simple and effective way to do this is to split the string into two parts: the first part consisting of the first character and the second part consisting of the rest of the string. This ensures that the first part is a single character and cannot be a palindrome (since it has only one character), and the second part is the remaining string which may or may not be a palindrome.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        if string[0] != string[-1]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        if string.count(string[0]) == n:
            print('NO')
            continue
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(string[0], string[1:])
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identified that the program has issues in the general case where the first and last characters are the same. The program fails to correctly handle such cases, leading to incorrect partitions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
