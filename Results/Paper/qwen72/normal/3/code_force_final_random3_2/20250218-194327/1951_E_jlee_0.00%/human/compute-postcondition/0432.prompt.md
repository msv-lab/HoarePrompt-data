Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s` where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is True or False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is a non-negative integer, `count2` is a non-negative integer. If `done` is False, the variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 6 characters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0 or greater, `count2` is 0 or greater, and `done` is False. If `done` was initially False, the variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is the number of positions where `s[j]` is not equal to `x` before the loop breaks, `count2` is the number of positions where `s[j]` is equal to `x` before the loop breaks, and `done` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
