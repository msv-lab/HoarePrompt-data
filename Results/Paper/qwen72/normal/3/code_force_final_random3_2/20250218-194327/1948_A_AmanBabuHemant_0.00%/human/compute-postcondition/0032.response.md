Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer for each test case. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `n` or `s`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has completed all the test cases. For each test case, the variable `n` will have been an input integer, and if `n` was even, a string `s` will have been generated by repeating `'110'` `n // 2` times. The length of `s` will be less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and it will be 200 or more if `n // 2` is 67 or more. If `n` was odd, no string `s` will have been generated for that test case.
