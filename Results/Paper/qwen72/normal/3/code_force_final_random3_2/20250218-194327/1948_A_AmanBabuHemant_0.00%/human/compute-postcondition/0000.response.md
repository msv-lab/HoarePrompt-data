The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the variable `t` the value of an integer input provided by the user. This input is expected to represent the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The length of the generated string should be at most 200, and the function should return "NO" if no such string can be generated.

Output State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO". `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
