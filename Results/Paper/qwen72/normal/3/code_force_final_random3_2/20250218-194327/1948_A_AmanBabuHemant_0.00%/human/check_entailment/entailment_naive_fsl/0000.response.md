Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a string of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem description. Instead, it generates a string of '1's and '0's. For example, when `n = 6`, the program outputs `110110110110`, which is not a valid string of uppercase Latin letters. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
