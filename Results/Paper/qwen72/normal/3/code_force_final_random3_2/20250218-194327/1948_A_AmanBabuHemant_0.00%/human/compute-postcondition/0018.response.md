Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.
   - If `n` is odd, `s` is not changed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains `print('YES')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print('YES')` is independent of the variables `t`, `n`, and `s`.
   - The value `'YES'` is a string literal and will be printed as is.

Since the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, the output will always be the same.

Output: **YES**
