Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `s`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.***
