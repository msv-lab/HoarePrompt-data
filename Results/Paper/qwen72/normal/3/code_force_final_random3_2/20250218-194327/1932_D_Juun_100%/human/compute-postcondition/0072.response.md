Output State: **`trumps` is a list with at least one element for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, `answers` is a list containing all strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each such suit, and `suits` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `trumps` list will still contain at least one element for each suit in the `suits` dictionary that has a non-`None` rank. The `answers` list will contain all the strings that were generated based on the `suits` dictionary, where each string is in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit with a non-`None` rank. The `suits` dictionary itself will not be modified by the loop.
