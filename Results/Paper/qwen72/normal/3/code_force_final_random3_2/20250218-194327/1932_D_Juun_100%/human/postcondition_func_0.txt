The function processes a series of card descriptions to form pairs of cards, where each pair consists of one card from a non-trump suit and one card from the trump suit. It reads the trump suit and a list of card descriptions from user input. The function then pairs cards of the same non-trump suit and sorts the trump cards in descending order. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-`None` ranks in the `suits` dictionary, the function prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. Otherwise, it prints the pairs of cards, with each pair on a new line, and the trump cards paired with the remaining non-`None` ranks in the `suits` dictionary. The function does not return any specific value, and the state of `suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `trumps`, and `answers` is not preserved or returned.
