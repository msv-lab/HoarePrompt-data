Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to reconstruct the rounds of a card game based on the given rules and a shuffled discard pile. Let's break down the logic and see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.
   - It initializes a list `trumps` to store the ranks of trump cards and a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the highest non-trump card for each suit.

2. **Card Processing**:
   - The program iterates through the list of cards.
   - If a card is a trump card, it adds its rank to the `trumps` list.
   - If a card is not a trump card and there is already a card of the same suit in `suits`, it pairs the two cards and adds the pair to the `answers` list.
   - If a card is not a trump card and there is no card of the same suit in `suits`, it stores the rank in `suits`.

3. **Pairing Remaining Cards**:
   - After processing all cards, the program checks if there are any remaining non-`None` ranks in the `suits` dictionary.
   - If there are remaining non-`None` ranks and no trump cards left, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits.
   - Otherwise, it pairs the remaining non-`None` ranks with trump cards and adds these pairs to the `answers` list.

4. **Printing Results**:
   - The program sorts the remaining trump cards in descending order.
   - It prints pairs of trump cards.
   - Finally, it prints the pairs stored in the `answers` list.

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Trump Card Pairing**: The program correctly pairs non-trump cards with trump cards if there are enough trump cards.
- **Non-Trump Card Pairing**: The program correctly pairs non-trump cards of the same suit and ensures the second card beats the first by rank.
- **Handling Insufficient Trumps**: The program correctly handles the case where there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards.
- **Output Format**: The program prints the pairs in the required format.

### Potential Bugs:
- **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of rounds but does not use it in the function `func_1`. This is a minor issue since the number of rounds is implicitly handled by the number of cards.
- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle cases where there are no non-trump cards and only trump cards, or vice versa, correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the given problem and its constraints. It pairs cards according to the rules and handles cases where it is impossible to form valid pairs. The logic is sound and the output format matches the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
