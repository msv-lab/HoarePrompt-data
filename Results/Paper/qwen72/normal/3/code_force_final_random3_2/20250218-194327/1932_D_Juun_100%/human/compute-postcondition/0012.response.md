Output State: **`card` is the first card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`, `suit` is not equal to `trump`, `suits[suit]` is `None`, and `answers` now contains a string that is the concatenation of `suit` and `rank` or `suits[suit]` and `rank`, sorted alphabetically, separated by a space.**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = None` sets the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The `answers` string still contains the concatenation of `suit` and `rank` or `suits[suit]` and `rank`, sorted alphabetically, separated by a space, but now `suits[suit]` is `None`.
