Postcondition: ***`suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. If `rank` is `None`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. `trumps` is an empty list.***
