Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit.
- `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order, containing at least one element.
- `answers` is a list containing strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. If `trumps` was not long enough to match all non-`None` ranks in `suits`, the loop will have printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`. Since `trumps` is sorted in descending order, the first `trumps.pop()` will return the largest element in the list, and the second `trumps.pop()` will return the second largest element in the list.
2. **`{trump}`**: This is a placeholder for the suit, which is not explicitly defined in the code snippet. However, based on the context, it is likely that `trump` is a variable that holds the suit of the trump card.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return the largest element in `trumps`.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return the second largest element in `trumps`.
- The `print` statement will format these values with the suit `trump`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `trumps` and `trump` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given information.

Output: **[largest_element_in_trumps][trump] [second_largest_element_in_trumps][trump]**

Where:
- `[largest_element_in_trumps]` is the largest element in the `trumps` list.
- `[second_largest_element_in_trumps]` is the second largest element in the `trumps` list.
- `[trump]` is the suit of the trump card.
