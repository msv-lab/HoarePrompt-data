The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of tuples. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` is a list of integers representing the number of rounds played in each test case, with the constraint 1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 16. Each tuple in the list contains a trump suit (one of "CDHS") and a list of 2n[i] unique card descriptions, where each card description is a two-character string with the first character being the rank of the card (one of "23456789") and the second character being the suit of the card (one of "CDHS").

Output:
- Case_1: The program returns `None`.
- Case_2: The program returns nothing.
- Case_3: The program returns without providing any specific value, leaving the state of `suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `trumps`, and `answers` unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds played in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains a trump suit (one of "CDHS") and a list of 2n[i] unique card descriptions. The function may return `None`, return nothing, or return without changing the state of `suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `trumps`, and `answers`.**
