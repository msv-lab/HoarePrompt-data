To determine what will be printed by the `print(answer)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `trumps` is a list with at least one element for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank.
2. `answers` is a list containing at least one string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each such suit.
3. `suits` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(answer)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `answer` is not explicitly defined in the code snippet, but it must be defined somewhere in the context of the program for the `print` statement to execute without an error.
- Given the initial state, `answers` is a list of strings, and `answer` is likely to be one of the elements from this list.
- Each element in `answers` is a string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `answer` is an element from the `answers` list, it will be a string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`.
- The exact value of `answer` depends on the specific element chosen from the `answers` list, but it will always follow the given format.

### Final Output:
Output: **'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}' (where `suit` is a suit from the `suits` list, `popped_trump` is the rank of the trump card popped from the `trumps` list for that suit, and `trump` is the rank of the trump card in the `trumps` list for that suit)**
