Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function Call in Loop**: The loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments. However, `func_1()` expects input to be provided within the function, which is not a good practice for readability and maintainability.

2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` reads input directly using `input()`, which is not ideal when the function is called multiple times in a loop. It would be better to pass the necessary inputs as arguments to the function.

3. **Trump Card Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the case where a non-trump card needs to beat another non-trump card. The logic for sorting and pairing non-trump cards is flawed.

4. **IMPOSSIBLE Condition**: The program does not correctly check all conditions for when the game is impossible. For example, if there are more non-trump cards than trump cards, the program might incorrectly print "IMPOSSIBLE" even if a valid sequence exists.

5. **Output Order**: The program does not ensure that the output is in the correct order of rounds. It prints the trump card pairs after all other pairs, which might not be valid.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_beat(card1, card2, trump):
    rank1, suit1 = card1
    rank2, suit2 = card2
    ranks = "23456789"
    if suit1 == trump and suit2 != trump:
        return True
    if suit1 == suit2 and ranks.index(rank1) > ranks.index(rank2):
        return True
    return False

def func_1(n, trump, cards):
    cards = cards.split()
    trumps = [card for card in cards if card[1] == trump]
    non_trumps = [card for card in cards if card[1] != trump]
    
    answers = []
    used = set()
    
    for card in non_trumps:
        if card in used:
            continue
        for other in non_trumps:
            if other in used or other == card:
                continue
            if can_beat(card, other, trump):
                answers.append(f"{card} {other}")
                used.add(card)
                used.add(other)
                break
        else:
            if trumps:
                answers.append(f"{card} {trumps.pop()}")
                used.add(card)
            else:
                print("IMPOSSIBLE")
                return
    
    while trumps:
        if len(trumps) < 2:
            print("IMPOSSIBLE")
            return
        card1 = trumps.pop()
        card2 = trumps.pop()
        answers.append(f"{card1} {card2}")
    
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    trump = input().strip()
    cards = input().strip()
    func_1(n, trump, cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Function Definition**: `func_1` now takes `n`, `trump`, and `cards` as arguments.
2. **Card Sorting**: The program separates trump and non-trump cards.
3. **Beating Logic**: The `can_beat` function checks if one card can beat another based on the rules.
4. **Pairing Cards**: The program attempts to pair non-trump cards first, and if it cannot, it uses trump cards to beat non-trump cards.
5. **Handling Trump Cards**: If there are remaining trump cards, it pairs them with each other.
6. **Output**: The program prints the pairs in the order they were found, ensuring that the output is valid.

This corrected program should handle all the cases correctly as described in the problem.
