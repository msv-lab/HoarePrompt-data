Postcondition: ***`card` is the third card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that now contains one additional element, which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, separated by a space, and `suits[suit]` is `None`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`. The list generated by `input().split()` must have at least 3 elements.***
