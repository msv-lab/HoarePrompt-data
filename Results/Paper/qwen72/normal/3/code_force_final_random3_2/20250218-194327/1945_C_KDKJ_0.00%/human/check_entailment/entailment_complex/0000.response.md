### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then calls `func_1` for each test case. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Cumulative Count Calculation:**
   - In `func_1`, the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's are calculated and stored in the list `S`. This is done by iterating through the string `a` and updating the counts accordingly. The list `S` is initialized with `[0, 0]` to handle the case where the road is laid before the first house. This is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Condition Checking and Answer Calculation:**
   - The function then iterates through possible positions for the road (from 0 to `n-1`) and checks the balance conditions for the left and right sides of the road:
     - `left * 2 < lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
     - `right * 2 < rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
   - If both conditions are met, the function checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position `ans`. If it is, `ans` is updated to `i`.
   - This logic is correct and follows the problem's requirements.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the value of `ans`, which is the position of the house after which the road should be laid to satisfy the conditions and be as close to the middle of the village as possible. If no such position is found, `ans` remains 0, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions. It handles multiple test cases and ensures that the road is laid in a way that satisfies the balance conditions for both sides of the village. The logic and conditions are consistent with the problem description.
