Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user consisting only of '0' and '1' and must have at least three characters, `S` is a list containing three sublists: `[0, 0]`, `[x, y]`, and `[x, y]`, `s` is the third character of `a`, `x` is equal to the second element of the last sublist in `S`, `y` is equal to the second element of the last sublist in `S` plus 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `S`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` remains equal to the second element of the last sublist in `S`.
- The updated value of `y` is now the second element of the last sublist in `S` plus 1.
