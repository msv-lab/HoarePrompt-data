The only object in the loop head is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. Since `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and it has already been called and returned a value greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must again return a value greater than 0.

However, `int(input())` is a function call that prompts the user for input, and it is not a variable that can be adjusted. Therefore, the state cannot be adjusted in the same way as in the previous examples. Instead, the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that the user must provide an input value greater than 0 when `int(input())` is called again.

State: **`int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called.**
