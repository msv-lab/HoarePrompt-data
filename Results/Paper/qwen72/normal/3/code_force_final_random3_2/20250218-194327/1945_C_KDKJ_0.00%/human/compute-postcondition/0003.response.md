Output State: **`int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called.**

The code snippet `func_1()` has been executed, but since the function `func_1()` does not modify any variables or return any values (based on the information provided), the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
