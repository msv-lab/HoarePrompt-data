The only object in the loop head is the result of the function call `int(input())`. This function call prompts the user to input a value, which is then converted to an integer and used to determine the number of iterations for the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must have returned a value greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, the user must input a value that, when converted to an integer, is greater than 0. However, since `int(input())` is called again at the start of each iteration, the state of the loop head is reset with each iteration, and the previous value of `int(input())` does not persist.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called.**
