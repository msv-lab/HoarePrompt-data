Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user consisting only of '0' and '1' and must have `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` in `S` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as the integer input by the user.
- The variable `a` remains the same as the string input by the user, which consists of `n` characters, each being either '0' or '1'.
- The list `S` will have `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` in `S` shows how many '0's and '1's have been counted from the beginning of the string `a` up to the current character. The last sublist in `S` will contain the total counts of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`.
