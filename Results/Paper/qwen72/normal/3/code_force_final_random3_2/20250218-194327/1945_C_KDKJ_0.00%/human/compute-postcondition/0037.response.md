Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is the first element of the first list in `S`, `lsum` is the sum of the first and second elements of the first list in `S`, `right` is the second element of the last list in `S` minus the second element of the first list in `S`, `rsum` is `n` - `lsum`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to 0.***
