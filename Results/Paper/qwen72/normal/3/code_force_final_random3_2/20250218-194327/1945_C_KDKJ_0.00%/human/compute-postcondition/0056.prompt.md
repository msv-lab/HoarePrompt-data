Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user consisting only of '0' and '1' and must have `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` in `S` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is the first element of the first list in `S`, `lsum` is the sum of the first and second elements of the first list in `S`, `right` is the second element of the last list in `S` minus the second element of the first list in `S`, `rsum` is `n` - `lsum`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is the first element of the list `S[i]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1. If `abs(n / 2 - i) > abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
