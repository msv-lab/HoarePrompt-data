Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`, `ans` is 2.**

The value of `ans` is updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
