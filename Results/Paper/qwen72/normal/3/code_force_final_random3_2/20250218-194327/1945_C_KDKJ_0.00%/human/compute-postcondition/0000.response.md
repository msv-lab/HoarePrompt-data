The only object in the loop head is the range object created by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the range object must generate at least one value, which means that `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.

Since no variables are passed to the function `func_2`, we cannot adjust any pre-existing variables. However, we can state the condition that must be met for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**
