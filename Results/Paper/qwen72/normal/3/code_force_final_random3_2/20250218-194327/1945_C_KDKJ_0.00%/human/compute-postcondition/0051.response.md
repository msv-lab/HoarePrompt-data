Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rsum` is updated to `n - lsum`.
- Since `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `rsum` is now `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
