The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the integer input provided by the user, which is expected to be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` must be 0.

State: **`t` must be an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
