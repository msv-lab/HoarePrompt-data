Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` is assigned the value of an input integer.**
