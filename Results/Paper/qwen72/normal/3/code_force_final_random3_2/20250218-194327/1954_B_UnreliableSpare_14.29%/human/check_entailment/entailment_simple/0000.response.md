### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Checking if All Elements are Equal:**
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - It iterates through the array and sets `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are not equal.
   - If all elements are the same, `flag` remains `True`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that will be updated.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive occurrences of the first element `arr[0]`.
   - For each different element encountered, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and the count of consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the count of `arr[0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `flag` is `True`, it means all elements are the same, and it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.
   - If `flag` is `False`, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
1. **Use of `Decimal('Infinity')`:**
   - Using `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be simplified to a large integer like `float('inf')` or `math.inf`.
   - However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element `arr[0]` and does not consider other elements or the overall structure of the array.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only check the count of `1` and not consider the count of `2` or the structure of the array.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove, the program should consider the entire array and the structure of the beautiful array.
   - One approach is to find the longest subarray where all elements are the same and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this subarray.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
