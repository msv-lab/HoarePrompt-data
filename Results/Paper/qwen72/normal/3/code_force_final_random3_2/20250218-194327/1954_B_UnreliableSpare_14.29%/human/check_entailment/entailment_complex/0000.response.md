Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**: The program correctly handles the input for multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is in line with the problem statement.

2. **Checking if All Elements Are the Same**: The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are different. This is a correct approach to determine if the array consists of identical elements, as an array of identical elements will always be beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

3. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Occurrences**: The program then attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and counting the occurrences of `arr[0]`. If a different element is encountered, the count is used to update the minimum value stored in `ans`.

4. **Handling the Beautiful Array Case**: If the `flag` is `True`, it means all elements are the same, and the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

5. **Output for Non-Beautiful Arrays**: If the `flag` is `False`, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element. However, this logic is flawed. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not just the minimum consecutive occurrences of the first element.

6. **Flaw in Logic**: The program does not correctly account for the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will print `1` because it finds the minimum consecutive occurrences of `1` (which is `1`). However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing any one of the `2`s will make the array non-beautiful. The program should instead count the number of elements that can be removed to break the beautiful property, which involves more than just counting consecutive occurrences of the first element.

7. **Decimal Usage**: The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler integer value like `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9`.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
