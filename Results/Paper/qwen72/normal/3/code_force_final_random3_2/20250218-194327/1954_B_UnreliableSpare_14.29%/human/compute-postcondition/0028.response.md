Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
