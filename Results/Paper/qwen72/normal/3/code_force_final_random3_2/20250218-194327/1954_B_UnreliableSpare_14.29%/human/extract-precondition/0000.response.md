Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Note: The function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to include the parameters for the array and the number of test cases. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
