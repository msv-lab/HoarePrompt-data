You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of the initial `ans` and the count of `arr[0]` in the list `arr`.
        #
        #Output:
    #State: *`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and `cnt`. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). If `flag` is True, it indicates that all consecutive elements in `arr` are equal. If `flag` is False, it indicates that there are at least two consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, a list of integers `a`, and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. It processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the properties of the beautiful array `a` for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
