Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0 if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
- If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is 0 and `cnt` remains 0.
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
- In both cases, the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` is 0, so `ans` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `flag`, `val`, `cnt`) retain their initial values or conditions.
