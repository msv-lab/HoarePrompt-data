Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.** 

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
