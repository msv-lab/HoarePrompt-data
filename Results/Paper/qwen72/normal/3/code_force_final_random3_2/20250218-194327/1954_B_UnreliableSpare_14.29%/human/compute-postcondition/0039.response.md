Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and `cnt`. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). If `flag` is True, it indicates that all consecutive elements in `arr` are equal. If `flag` is False, it indicates that there are at least two consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal.***
