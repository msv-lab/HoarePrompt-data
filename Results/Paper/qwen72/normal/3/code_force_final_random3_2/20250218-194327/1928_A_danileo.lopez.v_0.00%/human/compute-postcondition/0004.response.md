Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder variable.
- `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9.
- Either `a` is even or `b` is even.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
