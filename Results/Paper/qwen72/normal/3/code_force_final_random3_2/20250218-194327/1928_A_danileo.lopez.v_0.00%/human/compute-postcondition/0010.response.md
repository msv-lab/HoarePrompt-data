Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is a placeholder variable.
   - `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
   - If either `a` is even or `b` is even, the condition is satisfied.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition is not satisfied.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.
   - `a` and `b` have been updated to new integer values provided by the user.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Yes'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and updates for variables, but it does not directly affect the `print` statement itself.
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, or `_`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
