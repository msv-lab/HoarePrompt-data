The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The placeholder variable `_` is also mentioned but is not utilized in the code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and both are odd.
- `_` is a placeholder variable.

However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
