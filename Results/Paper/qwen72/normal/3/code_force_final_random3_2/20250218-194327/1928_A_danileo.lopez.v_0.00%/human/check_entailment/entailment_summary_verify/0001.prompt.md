You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He can then try to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles. These two rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times (b/2)\) or \((a/2) \times b\).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. Therefore, he cannot form a new rectangle.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the condition for forming a new rectangle: if either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
   - The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
