Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and does not return any value. **
