Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`. `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and `a` and `b` have been updated to the new values provided by the user. If `a` or `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program executes the else part.**
