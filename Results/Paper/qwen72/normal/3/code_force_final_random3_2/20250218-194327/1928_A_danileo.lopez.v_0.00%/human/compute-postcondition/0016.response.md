Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.
- `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `a` and `b` have been updated to the new values provided by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'No'`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
The code will print the string 'No'.
Output: **No**
