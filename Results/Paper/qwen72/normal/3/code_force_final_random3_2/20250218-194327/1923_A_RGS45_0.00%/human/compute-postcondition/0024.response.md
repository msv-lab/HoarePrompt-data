Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a string `arr` of length `n` where each character is either '0' (free cell) or '1' (cell with a chip). The function outputs the number of free cells ('0') between the first and last chip ('1') in each ribbon, inclusive. The function does not return any value; it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that all test cases have been processed, and the results have been printed to the console. **
