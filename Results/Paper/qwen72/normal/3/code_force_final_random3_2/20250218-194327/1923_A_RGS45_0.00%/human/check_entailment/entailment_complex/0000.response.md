Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of cells `n` and the ribbon state `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first '1'. The actual index of the last chip is `n - y - 1`.

3. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This substring should contain all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells ('0') in the extracted substring and prints it. This is the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the ribbon already contains a single block of chips (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1 1`), the substring `z` will contain no '0's, and the function will correctly print `0`.
   - If there is only one chip in the ribbon, the substring `z` will contain no '0's, and the function will correctly print `0`.

6. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the first and last chip positions.
   - The substring extraction ensures that only the relevant part of the ribbon is considered.
   - Counting the '0's in the substring gives the correct number of moves needed to form a single block of chips.

7. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function assumes that the input is always valid (i.e., `arr` is a string of '0's and '1's and contains at least one '1'). This is consistent with the problem description.
   - The function does not handle the case where `arr` does not contain any '1's, but the problem description guarantees that at least one cell contains a chip, so this is not an issue.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
