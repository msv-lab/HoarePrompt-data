Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The value of `arr` is updated to the new input string provided by the user.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial state, but `x` and `y` will be recalculated based on the new value of `arr`.
- The value of `x` will be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.
- The value of `y` will be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed new `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.
- The value of `z` will be the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive), assuming `x` and `y` are valid indices.
