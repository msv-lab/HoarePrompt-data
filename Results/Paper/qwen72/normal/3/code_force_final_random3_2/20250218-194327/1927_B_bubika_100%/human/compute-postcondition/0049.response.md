Output State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[-1]` which is 1, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `i` is the second integer in the new `s`, `x` is -1, `r` is an empty string, and `x` is now the index of `i` in `b`.**

Since `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the last element being 1, and `i` is the second integer in the list `s` which contains integers between 0 and 25, the value of `x` is -1 if `i` is not 1 (since 1 is only at the last index of `b`). If `i` is 1, then `x` is 25. Therefore, the output state is:
