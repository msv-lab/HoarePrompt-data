The only objects in the loop head are the list `s` and the variable `i`. The loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more element in `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first integer in the new `s`, and `s` must contain at least `n` integers, with `n` being greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will now be the second integer in the list `s`, and `s` must still contain at least `n` integers, with `n` being greater than 2.

State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[-1]` which is 1, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `i` is the second integer in the new `s`, `x` is -1, `r` is an empty string.**
