Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each given trace, there exists a suitable string `s`. The variable `a` is now the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will result in an `IndexError` on the first iteration because the value of `i` is not found in the list `b`, which is a list of 26 zeros.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a list where the elements at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` are incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the integer in `s`. `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `r` is the string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the integers in `s`, repeated according to the number of times each integer appears in `s`. `i` is the last integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a list of 26 integers where each index `j` in `b` represents the number of times the integer `j` appeared in `s`. `t` is 2. `n` is an input integer greater than 2. `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive). `i` is the last integer in the new `s`. `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`. `r` is a string containing the characters from `a` corresponding to the indices of the integers in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
