Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user, `r` is an empty string, and the loop will still result in an `IndexError` on the first iteration because the value of `i` is not found in the list `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a list where the element at index `x` is now 1, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least one integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` of `a`, `i` is the first integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b` (which is always 0 because `b` is a list of 26 zeros and `i` is guaranteed to be in `s` and between 0 and 25).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a list where the element at index `x` is now 2, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least one integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` of `a` repeated twice, `i` is the second integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a list where the element at index `x` is now 3, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least three integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` of `a` repeated three times, `i` is the third integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
