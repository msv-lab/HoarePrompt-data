Output State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `r` is the string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the integers in `s`, repeated according to the number of times each integer appears in `s`. `i` is the last integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = [0] * 26` initializes `b` to a list of 26 zeros.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `r`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `b` is now a list of 26 zeros, which is the only change from the initial state.
