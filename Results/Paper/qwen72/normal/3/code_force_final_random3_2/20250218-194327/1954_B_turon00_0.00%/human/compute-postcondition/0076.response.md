The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and the loop will execute again if `i` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `n`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `i` is 1, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is 1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.**
