Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` is between 1 and `n`, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
- The variable `i` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of the list `a`.
- The variable `tmp` is still equal to `a[0]`, the first element of the list `a`.
- The variable `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
- The variable `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop's execution.
