The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and 1.**
