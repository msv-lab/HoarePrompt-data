The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`
- `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful
- `i` is 0
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.
- `n` must remain the same, as it is the upper limit for the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
