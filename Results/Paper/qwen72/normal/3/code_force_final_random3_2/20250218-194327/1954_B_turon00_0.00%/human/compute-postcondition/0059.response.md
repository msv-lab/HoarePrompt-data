Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful (though the definition of "beautiful" is not provided, it doesn't affect the logic of the code).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
- If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.
- If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.
- After the code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` is executed, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Set `aa` Creation**:
   - `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
   - If `a` contains only one unique element, then `len(aa) == 1`.
   - If `a` contains more than one unique element, then `len(aa) > 1`.

2. **Condition Based on `len(aa)`**:
   - If `len(aa) == 1`, then `ans` is set to 0 and `cnt` is set to 0.
   - If `len(aa) > 1`, then:
     - `ans` is initialized to some value (not specified in the initial state, but it will be updated during the loop).
     - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.
     - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt` using `ans = min(ans, cnt)`.

3. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - If `len(aa) == 1`, `ans` is 0.
   - If `len(aa) > 1`, `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop.

### Output Determination:
- If `a` contains only one unique element, `ans` will be 0.
- If `a` contains more than one unique element, `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` observed during the loop.

Since the exact values of `a` and the loop logic are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ans` in the second case. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is 0 if the list `a` contains only one unique element, otherwise ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` observed during the loop)**
