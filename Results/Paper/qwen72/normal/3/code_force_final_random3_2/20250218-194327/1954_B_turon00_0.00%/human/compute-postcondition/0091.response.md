Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then processes the list `a` to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same integer, excluding segments of the entire list if all elements are identical. If all elements in `a` are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of such segments. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the function has no return value. **
