Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.
- The initial value of `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.
- The value of `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
- After executing the code, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
