Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.** 

The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers read from the input, where the input is split by spaces and each element is converted to an integer. The length of `a` is `n`, and each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
