Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user input. It then modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one. After this, it processes the modified list to create a new list `ans` that contains `n` integers, where the first part of `ans` is the unique elements of `a` in descending order, and the remaining elements fill the gaps between these unique elements to ensure all integers from 1 to the maximum element in the modified `a` are represented. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. **
