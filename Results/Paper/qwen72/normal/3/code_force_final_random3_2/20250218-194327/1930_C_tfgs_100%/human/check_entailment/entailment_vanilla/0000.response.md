### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
   - We perform `n` operations where in each operation, we:
     - Select an index `i` such that `1 <= i <= |a|`.
     - Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
     - Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
   - We need to construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically largest `b`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`:
     - It reads the length `n` of the array `a`.
     - It reads the elements of `a` and modifies each element by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`.
     - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element.
     - It converts the modified array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
     - It initializes `cnt` to the number of elements that were not unique in the modified array.
     - It constructs the array `ans` by:
       - For each unique element in `a`, it adds the element to `ans`.
       - It also adds elements that are just below the current element to `ans` to ensure the largest possible lexicographical order.
     - Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element.
   - It correctly uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element.
   - It correctly converts the modified array to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - The logic to construct `ans` by adding elements that are just below the current element ensures that the array `b` is lexicographically largest.
   - The program handles the case where there are duplicate elements by adding the necessary elements to `ans` to maintain the largest possible order.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `a` are unique.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
   - The program ensures that the final array `ans` is of the correct length and is sorted in descending order.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it involves sorting and set operations which are typically `O(n log n)`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the problem description. It handles the operations and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
