Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `ans` is a list that is updated with `cnt` new elements, each being the last element of `ans` minus 1, until the loop finishes.

2. **Understanding the Update Process**:
   - Since `cnt` is 0, the loop that updates `ans` will not run at all. This means that no new elements will be added to `ans`.

3. **State of `ans`**:
   - If `ans` is not initialized before the loop, it will be an empty list.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces. Since `ans` is an empty list, nothing will be printed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **(nothing printed)**
