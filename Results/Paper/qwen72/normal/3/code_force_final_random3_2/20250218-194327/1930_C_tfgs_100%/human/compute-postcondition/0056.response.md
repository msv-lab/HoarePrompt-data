Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is 0, `ans` has 0 elements appended, `j` is -1, `cnt` is decreased by 0, `cur` is unchanged.**

The value of `cur` is reduced by `adv`, but since `adv` is 0, `cur` remains unchanged. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `j`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain the same as in the initial state.
