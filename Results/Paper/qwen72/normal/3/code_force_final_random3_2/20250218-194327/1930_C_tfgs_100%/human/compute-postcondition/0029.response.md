Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0 or greater, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, but the frequency of `a[i]` is now `counter[a[i]] - 1`, `cur` is `cur - adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` remains `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each element is `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` in the range from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` remains an empty list, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than or equal to 0 if `i` > 0, otherwise `adv` is not defined, `j` is `adv - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `j` is not defined, `ans` now contains one additional element `a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the integer `a[i]` in the `counter` object by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
