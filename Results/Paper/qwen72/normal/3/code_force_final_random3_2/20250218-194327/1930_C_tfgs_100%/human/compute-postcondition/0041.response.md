Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is 0, `ans` contains one additional element `a[i]`, `j` is -1, `cnt` is decreased by 0, `cur` is decreased by 0.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains greater than 0.
- `adv` remains 0.
- `ans` still contains one additional element `a[i]` as it did before.
- `j` remains -1.
- `cnt` remains unchanged because it was decreased by `adv`, which is 0.
- `cur` is decreased by `adv`, which is 0, so `cur` remains unchanged.
