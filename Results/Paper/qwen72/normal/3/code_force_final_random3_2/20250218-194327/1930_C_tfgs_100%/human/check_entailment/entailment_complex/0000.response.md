### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Modifications:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.
   - It then modifies each element of `a` by adding its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`). This step is correct as it follows the problem's requirement to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

2. **Handling Unique Elements:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the modified `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the set in descending order. This step is correct as it ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in decreasing order, which is necessary for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`.

3. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - It also fills the gaps between the elements of `a` to ensure that all integers from 1 to the maximum element in the modified `a` are represented in `ans`. This is done by appending the largest possible values that are not already in `ans` and are less than the current element being processed.
   - The `cnt` variable keeps track of the number of elements that need to be added to fill the gaps, and `cur` keeps track of the number of elements that can be added without violating the uniqueness constraint.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing all unique elements, the program ensures that `ans` has exactly `n` elements by appending the necessary number of elements to fill any remaining gaps.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by ensuring that all elements are unique and sorted in descending order.
- The logic for filling gaps and maintaining the lexicographical order is sound and correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
