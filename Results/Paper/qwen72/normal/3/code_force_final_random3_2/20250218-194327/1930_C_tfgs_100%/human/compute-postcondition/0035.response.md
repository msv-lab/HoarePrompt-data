The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `adv`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, and `ans` contains one more element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `adv` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains one more element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `adv` must be greater than `j`**
