Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated with `cnt` new elements, each being the last element of `ans` minus 1, until the loop finishes.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `cnt` is decremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- The list `ans` is updated by appending new elements, each of which is the last element of `ans` minus 1. This process continues until the loop has executed `cnt` times, filling `ans` with the required number of new elements.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `counter`, `cur`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
