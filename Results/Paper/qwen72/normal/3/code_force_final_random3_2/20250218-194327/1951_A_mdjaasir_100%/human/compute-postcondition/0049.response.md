The function `func` accepts two parameters `start` and `end`. Both `start` and `end` are integers, and they represent the range of folder names to be processed, where folder names are expected to be numeric. The parameter constraint is that `start` must be less than or equal to `end`. The function returns a list of folder names as strings, where each folder name is a number from `start` to `end` inclusive.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `start` and `end`, both integers where `start` <= `end`. It returns a list of folder names as strings, each representing a number from `start` to `end` inclusive.**
