Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `a`. Regardless of the value of `count`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
