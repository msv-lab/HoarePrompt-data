Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the program retains the initial state. If `count` is exactly 2 or less than or equal to 2 and odd, the program also retains the initial state.***
