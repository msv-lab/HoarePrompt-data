The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0), `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either `[0]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0), `minn` is 0 or 1, `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0]`, `minn` is 1, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` if it is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn`.**
