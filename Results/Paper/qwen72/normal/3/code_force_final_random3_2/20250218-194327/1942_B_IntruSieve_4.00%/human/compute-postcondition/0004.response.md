Output State: **`maxx` is 0, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0.**

The variable `maxx` is initialized to 0. The function `func_1` is still not properly defined, and the other variables (`n`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
