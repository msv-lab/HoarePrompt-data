#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. The function should take parameters to match the problem description, such as `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the permutation and array, and `a` for the array of integers. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and `a` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for all `arr[i] <= 0` in the list `arr`. `func_1` is not properly defined. `n` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is a list containing the values `0` for each `arr[i] > 0` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each `arr[i] <= 0`. `minn` is the number of positive elements in `arr` plus 1 if the last positive element was equal to the current `minn` value. `i` is `n-1`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `mex` is a list containing all its elements, and the loop has printed each element of `mex` exactly once, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers. It processes the list to generate a new list `mex` where each element is either `0` if the corresponding element in `arr` is positive, or the absolute difference between the element in `arr` and a running minimum value `minn` if the element is non-positive. The function then prints each element of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.
