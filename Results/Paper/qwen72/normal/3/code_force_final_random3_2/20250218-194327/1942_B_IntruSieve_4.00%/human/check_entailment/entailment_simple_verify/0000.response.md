### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `minn` and `maxx` are both initialized to 0.

3. **Loop Through `arr`:**
   - For each element `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` by 1.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - The function should take parameters to match the problem description, but it does not. This is a minor issue as the function reads the inputs directly.

- **State Inside Loop:**
  - For `arr[i] > 0`, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is correct because the MEX of the first `i` elements should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used, which is `minn`.
  - For `arr[i] <= 0`, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This is intended to handle the case where `arr[i]` is negative, but the logic is flawed.

#### Flawed Logic:
- **Handling `arr[i] <= 0`:**
  - The program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to `mex`. This does not necessarily ensure that the MEX condition is met.
  - For example, in the input `1 1 -2 1 2`, the program should output `0 1 4 2 3` but instead outputs `0 1 2 3 4`.
  - Specifically, when `arr[2] = -2`, the program calculates `abs(-2 - 1) = 3` and appends 3 to `mex`. However, the correct value should be 4 to satisfy `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`.

#### Correct Solution:
- The correct approach should involve maintaining a set of used elements and calculating the MEX for each prefix of `p` to ensure the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` is met.

#### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the negative values in `arr` correctly and fails to ensure the MEX condition for all elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
