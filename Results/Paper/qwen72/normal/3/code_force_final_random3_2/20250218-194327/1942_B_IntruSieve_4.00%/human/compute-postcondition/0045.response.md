The function `func_1` is intended to accept parameters that are not properly defined in the provided function definition. The correct parameters should be `t` for the number of test cases, and `test_cases` for a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n` (the length of the permutation and array) and `a` (the array of integers) for each test case.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`). The function should return the result of processing each test case, but the specific output based on the input parameters is not provided in the problem description.**
