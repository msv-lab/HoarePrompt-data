Postcondition: **`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1). `func_1` is not properly defined. `n` is an input integer greater than 1. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) and `0`. `minn` is 0, 1, or 2. `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0, 0, abs(arr[i] - minn)]`, `minn` is 2, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn`, `0`, and `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.**
