You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. The function should take parameters to match the problem description, such as `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the permutation and array, and `a` for the array of integers. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and `a` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for all `arr[i] <= 0` in the list `arr`. `func_1` is not properly defined. `n` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is a list containing the values `0` for each `arr[i] > 0` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each `arr[i] <= 0`. `minn` is the number of positive elements in `arr` plus 1 if the last positive element was equal to the current `minn` value. `i` is `n-1`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `mex` is a list containing all its elements, and the loop has printed each element of `mex` exactly once, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for constructing the permutation `p` from the array `a` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

### Actual Output:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

### Analysis:
The program constructs the `mex` array based on the values in `arr`, but it does not correctly ensure that the permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

For the input `1 1 -2 1 2`, the expected permutation is `0 1 4 2 3`, but the program outputs `0 1 2 3 4`, which does not satisfy the condition for `a_3`:
- `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1` (expected: `a_3 = -2`).

The program fails to correctly handle the case where `arr[i]` is negative, and it does not correctly adjust the `mex` values to ensure the condition is met for all elements in `arr`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
