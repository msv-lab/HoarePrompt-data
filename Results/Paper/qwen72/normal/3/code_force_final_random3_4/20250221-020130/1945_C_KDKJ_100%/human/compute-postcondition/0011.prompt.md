You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature, but within the function, n is an integer representing the number of houses (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing sublists where each sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point. The final sublist in `S` will be `[count_of_0s, count_of_1s]` where `count_of_0s` is the total number of '0's in `a` and `count_of_1s` is the total number of '1's in `a`.
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = i
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - i
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: `n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same string consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is the same list containing sublists where each sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point, and `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `i` that meets the above criteria.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the given conditions.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns a value based on a string `a` of length `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) consisting only of '0' and '1'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
