Output State: None of the variables in the function signature are used. 

The loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input, and each iteration calls the function `func_1()`. However, since `func_1()` does not modify any variables in the function signature and no variables are used within the loop, the initial state remains unchanged after all iterations of the loop have finished.
