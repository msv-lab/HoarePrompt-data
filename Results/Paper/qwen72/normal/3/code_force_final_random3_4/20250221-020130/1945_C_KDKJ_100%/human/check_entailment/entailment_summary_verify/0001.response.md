### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_1` reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `func_1` calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`.
   - `S[i][0]` represents the number of zeros from the start of the string up to the i-th house.
   - `S[i][1]` represents the number of ones from the start of the string up to the i-th house.
   - This is done correctly by iterating through the string and updating the prefix sums accordingly.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be built (from 0 to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of zeros on the left side of the road.
     - `lsum`: the total number of houses on the left side of the road.
     - `right`: the number of ones on the right side of the road.
     - `rsum`: the total number of houses on the right side of the road.
   - It checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the total houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
   - It checks if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the total houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - The conditions are correctly formulated to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`n / 2`) than the previously stored answer.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `-1` to ensure it gets updated on the first valid position.
   - The program correctly selects the optimal position by minimizing `abs(n / 2 - i)`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the road can be built before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`).
   - The conditions for these edge cases are correctly checked.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` correctly processes each test case and prints the optimal position for the road.
- The function summaries are accurate and do not contradict the program's behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the edge cases and ensures the optimal position is selected based on the given conditions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
