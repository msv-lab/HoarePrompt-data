Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the input. This aligns with the problem description.
   - **Cumulative Count Calculation**: The function calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`. This is necessary to determine the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road for each possible position.
   - **Condition Checking**: The function iterates over all possible positions `i` (0 to `n` inclusive) to check if the conditions for the road placement are met. Specifically, it checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half the length of the left side and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half the length of the right side.
   - **Optimal Position Selection**: The function selects the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions. If no such position exists, it prints `-1`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description that the input contains multiple test cases.
   - **No State Modification**: The function does not modify any variables in its function signature, which is correct since it is designed to handle multiple test cases independently.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using `func_2` to call `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions.
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case, as required by the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet all the requirements of the problem description and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
