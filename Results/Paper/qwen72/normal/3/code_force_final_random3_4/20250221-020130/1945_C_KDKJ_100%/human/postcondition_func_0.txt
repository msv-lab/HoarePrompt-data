The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`. The function then determines the value of `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while ensuring that the number of '0's on the left side of the split (up to index `i`) is at least half the length of the left side, and the number of '1's on the right side of the split (from index `i` to the end) is at least half the length of the right side. Finally, it prints this value of `i`. If no such `i` exists, it prints `-1`.
