To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `S` is a list containing sublists where each sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point.
   - `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the string `a`.
   - `a` is a binary string.
   - `S` is a list where each element is a sublist `[lsum, rsum]`:
     - `lsum` is the cumulative count of '0's up to the current position.
     - `rsum` is the cumulative count of '1's up to the current position.
   - `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while ensuring that:
     - `left * 2 >= lsum` (where `left` is the count of '0's up to index `i`).
     - `right * 2 >= rsum` (where `right` is the count of '1's up to index `i`).

3. **Determine `ans`:**
   - The goal is to find an index `i` such that the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied.
   - The index `i` should also minimize the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `i` that meets the above criteria.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of i that minimizes the absolute difference between n / 2 and i while satisfying the conditions left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum)**
