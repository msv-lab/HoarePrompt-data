Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a permutation `p` and an array `a`. It simulates a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, start at different positions in the permutation and move according to the rules defined by the permutation and the array. The function calculates the maximum score each player can achieve within a given number of moves `k` and determines the winner. For each test case, it prints "Bodya" if Bodya wins, "Sasha" if Sasha wins, or "Draw" if the scores are equal. The function does not return any value. **
