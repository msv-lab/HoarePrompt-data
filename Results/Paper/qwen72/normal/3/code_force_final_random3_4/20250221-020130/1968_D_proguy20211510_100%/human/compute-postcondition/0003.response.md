The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variables `MOD`, `alpha`, `YES`, and `NO` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
