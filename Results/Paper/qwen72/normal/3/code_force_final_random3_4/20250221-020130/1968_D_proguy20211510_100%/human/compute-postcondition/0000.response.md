Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with the necessary input parameters as described in the problem statement, but the actual parameters are not provided in the function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. Each parameter should adhere to the constraints: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= k <= 10^9`, `1 <= p_i <= n`, and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'.**
