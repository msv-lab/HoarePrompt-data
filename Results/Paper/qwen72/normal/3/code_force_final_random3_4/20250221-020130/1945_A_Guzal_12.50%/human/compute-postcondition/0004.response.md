Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. It then calculates a value `k` based on the following rules: if `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3)` and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `a + (b + c) // 3` and increments `k` by 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. The function prints the value of `k` for each test case. After processing `n` test cases, the function ends. The final state of the program is that `a`, `b`, and `c` are the values provided in the last test case, and `k` is the value calculated in the last test case. **
