### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively).

2. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert must have a tent to themselves, so the program correctly adds `a` to the total number of tents `k`.

3. **Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is intended to check if it is impossible to form complete groups of 3 for the extroverts. However, this condition is not entirely correct:
     - The first part `b % 3 != 0 and c < 3` checks if there are not enough universals to form a complete group of 3 with the remaining extroverts. This is a valid check.
     - The second part `(b + c) % 3 != 0` is redundant because if `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, it already implies that `(b + c) % 3 != 0`.
   - The correct condition should be `if b % 3 != 0 and c < 3 - b % 3:`. This ensures that there are enough universals to form complete groups of 3 with the remaining extroverts.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of tents `k` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Condition:
- The original condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is overly complex and redundant. The simplified condition `if b % 3 != 0 and c < 3 - b % 3:` is more accurate and sufficient to determine if it is impossible to form complete groups of 3 for the extroverts.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if b % 3 != 0 and c < 3 - b % 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program has a logical error in the condition to check if it is impossible to form complete groups of 3 for the extroverts.
- Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
