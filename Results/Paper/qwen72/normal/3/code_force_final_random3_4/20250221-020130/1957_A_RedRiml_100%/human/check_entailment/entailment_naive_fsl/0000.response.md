Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons with more than 3 sides. The program assumes that any length that appears at least 3 times can form a polygon, but it only counts the number of triangles that can be formed. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

The correct output should be `2` because we can form two squares (4-sided polygons) from the sticks. However, the program will output `2` because it only counts the number of triangles that can be formed, which is incorrect. The program should be modified to consider the formation of polygons with more than 3 sides.
