### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Setup:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the First Maximum (mak):**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0.
   - The function iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` and performs a query `? mak mak i i`.
   - The query compares `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. Since `p_mak | p_mak` is always `p_mak` and `p_i | p_i` is always `p_i`, the query effectively compares `p_mak` with `p_i`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i` is greater than `p_mak`, so `mak` is updated to `i`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum (mak2) and Candidate Indices (pans):**
   - `mak2` is initialized to the value of `mak`.
   - The function iterates over all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and performs a query `? mak mak2 i mak2`.
   - The query compares `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i` is a better candidate for the second maximum, so `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
   - If the response is `=`, it means `p_i` is equal to `p_mak2`, so `i` is added to `pans`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The function iterates over the candidate indices in `pans` and performs a query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]`.
   - The query compares `(p_pans[mak] | p_pans[mak])` with `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])`, which is effectively comparing `p_pans[mak]` with `p_pans[i]`.
   - If the response is `>`, it means `p_pans[i]` is greater than `p_pans[mak]`, so `mak` is updated to `i`.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - The function prints the indices `mak2` and `mak` that maximize `p_i âŠ• p_j`.
   - The function flushes the output to ensure the result is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation `p` and uses it to find the second maximum value.
- The queries are designed to compare values and update the indices accordingly.
- The final step ensures that the indices `mak2` and `mak` are printed, which should maximize the XOR operation.

### Correctness:
- The function uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- The logic for finding the maximum and second maximum values is correct.
- The final step of printing the indices that maximize the XOR operation is also correct.
