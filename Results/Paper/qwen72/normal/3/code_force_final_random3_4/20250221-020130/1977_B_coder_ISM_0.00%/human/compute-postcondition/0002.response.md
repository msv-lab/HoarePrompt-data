Output State: **The variable `x` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, and `t` is an input integer. The list `s` contains the binary representation of `x` with possible modifications due to the loop logic, and `length` is the length of the list `s` after all iterations. The modifications to `s` include converting pairs of consecutive '1's to '-1' and '0', and potentially appending an additional '1' to the list if the last bit was modified.**
