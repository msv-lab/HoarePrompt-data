### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x` where \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\).

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` with possible modifications.
   - It iterates over the range from 0 to 29 (since \(x < 2^{30}\)), and for each bit position `i`, it checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true). If it is, it appends '1' to `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

3. **Modification of Binary Representation:**
   - The function then iterates over the list `s` to modify it according to the problem constraints.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a modification has been made to the previous bit.
   - If the flag is set and the current bit is '0', it changes the current bit to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is not set and the current bit and the next bit are both '1', it changes the current bit to '-1' and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set, it changes the current bit to '0'.
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the last bit is not '0', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The function iterates over the list `s` again to ensure that there are no consecutive '1' and '-1' pairs. If such a pair is found, it changes the '-1' to '0' and the '1' to '-1'.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the length of the modified list `s`.
   - It then prints the modified list `s`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly generates the binary representation of `x` and modifies it to ensure that no two consecutive bits are non-zero.
- The flag mechanism is used to handle the carry-over effect when converting pairs of '1's to '-1' and '0'.
- The final adjustment loop ensures that the array meets the condition that there are no consecutive '1' and '-1' pairs.
- The function prints the correct length and the modified array for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. It handles the constraints and produces the expected output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
