### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.
   - The program then calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function first checks if the smallest pile size is greater than 1. If so, Alice wins immediately because she can choose `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, the function proceeds to check the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - The variable `A` is used to track whether Alice or Bob will win. It is initialized to `False` (indicating Bob's turn).
   - The program sorts the unique pile sizes and iterates through them to check if the difference between consecutive sizes is exactly 1. If any difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks, and `A` is set to `True` (indicating Alice's turn).
   - If all differences are exactly 1, `A` is toggled again to ensure the correct player wins.
   - Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' otherwise.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is based on the properties of the game:
     - If the smallest pile size is greater than 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size.
     - If the smallest pile size is 1, the game becomes more complex. The key insight is that if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all exactly 1, the game is balanced, and the player who starts (Alice) will lose if the number of piles is odd. If any difference is greater than 1, Alice can force a win by choosing an appropriate `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the smallest pile size is greater than 1 correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all exactly 1 correctly.
   - The program correctly toggles the turn between Alice and Bob based on the differences.

5. **Overall Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the given problem description.
   - The input handling and test case loop are also correct and match the problem's constraints.
