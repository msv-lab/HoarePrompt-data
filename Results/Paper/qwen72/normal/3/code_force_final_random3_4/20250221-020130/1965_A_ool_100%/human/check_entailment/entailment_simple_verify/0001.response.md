### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.
   - **Note**: The variable `n` is read but not used in the function `func_1`. This is not a critical issue since the function only needs the pile sizes.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track whether Alice or Bob will win.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes using `set(arr)` and then sorting it.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - If the smallest pile size (i.e., `set_[0]`) is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. Hence, the function returns 'Alice'.
   - **Correct**: This is a valid strategy because if the smallest pile is greater than 1, Alice can remove that many stones from all non-empty piles, leaving Bob with no valid move.

4. **Consecutive Check**:
   - The program then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, it toggles the value of `A` one more time.
   - **Correct**: This check is necessary because if the pile sizes are consecutive, the game can be reduced to a simpler form where the parity of the number of piles determines the winner. If the pile sizes are not consecutive, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with a non-consecutive sequence, which is a winning strategy for Alice.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.
   - **Correct**: The final decision is based on the parity of the number of moves Alice can make, which is correctly determined by the toggling mechanism.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
  - This state is correctly described.

- **State After Initial Check**:
  - If `set_[0]` is not 1, the function returns 'Alice'.
  - **Correct**: This is a valid and correct check.

- **State After Consecutive Check**:
  - The program iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1.
  - If the difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
  - **Correct**: This check ensures that if the pile sizes are not consecutive, Alice can always win by breaking the sequence.
  - If the pile sizes are consecutive, it toggles the value of `A` one more time.
  - **Correct**: This toggling accounts for the parity of the number of moves, which is crucial for determining the winner in a consecutive sequence.

- **Final State**:
  - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.
  - **Correct**: The final decision is based on the parity of the number of moves, which is correctly determined by the toggling mechanism.
