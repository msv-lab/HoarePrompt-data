Postcondition: **The list `xx` remains unchanged, containing `n + 1` strings where the first string is empty and the next `n` strings are the inputs provided by the user. The list `a` and `b` also remain unchanged, containing the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters for each row and column, respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the length of `sa` after the loop has executed, and the loop prints a modified version of each row in `xx` where '?' characters are replaced with 'F' if the row or column index is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise. If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, the list `sb` now contains the indices of the rows or columns where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0, as well as the indices of the rows or columns where both the count of 'F' and 'S' characters are 0. The loop prints the modified rows of `xx` where '?' characters are replaced with 'S' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise.**
