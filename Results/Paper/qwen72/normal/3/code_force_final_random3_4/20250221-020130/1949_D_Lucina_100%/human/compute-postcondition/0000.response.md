Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, and it must satisfy 2 <= n <= 24. The input is a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at position (i, j) is the same as the character at position (j, i), and the character at position (i, i) is always '.'. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.**
