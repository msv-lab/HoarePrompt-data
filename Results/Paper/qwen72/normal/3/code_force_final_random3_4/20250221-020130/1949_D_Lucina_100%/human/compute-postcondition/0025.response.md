The function `func` accepts a list of strings as its parameter. The list contains `n` strings, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. Each string in the list is of length `n` and consists of characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at position (i, j) in the list is the same as the character at position (j, i), and the character at position (i, i) is always '.'. At most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided, meaning at most \(2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.

The function returns a string indicating the result of the function based on the input list. The specific output depends on the configuration of the characters in the input list, but the exact details of the output are not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of `n` strings, each of length `n` and containing characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with specific symmetry and character constraints. It returns a string based on the configuration of the characters in the input list.**
