n and t are integers where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and t = 1, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, nodes is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to n and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the key node, start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, and moves is a list of integers representing the number of moves from the start node to each leaf node.
