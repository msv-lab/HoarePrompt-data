### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation:**
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list (`nodes`), which is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. This is a standard and efficient way to represent a tree in Python.

2. **Leaf Node Identification:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one adjacent node) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. This is necessary for the game logic, as leaf nodes are the terminal points in the tree.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. It correctly handles the base case where the starting node is a leaf node (returning `[0]`), and for non-leaf nodes, it recursively calculates the distances to all its children and increments them by 1. This ensures that the distances are correctly computed.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - The game logic is implemented in `func_2` after calling `func_1`. The function checks if there is at least one odd number in the list of distances (`moves`). If there is, Ron wins the round because he can make the first move and force Hermione into a position where she has to make an even number of moves, which will eventually lead to a loss. If all distances are even, Hermione wins because she can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring that Ron is the one who cannot make a move first.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input is read correctly, and the output is printed as required. The program handles the input constraints and the single round (`t = 1`) as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game logic and handles the input and output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
