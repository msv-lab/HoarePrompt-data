Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `edges` is still an empty list, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list of adjacent nodes (integers) based on the input edges, `start` is an input integer, `moves` remains unchanged, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one adjacent node.**
