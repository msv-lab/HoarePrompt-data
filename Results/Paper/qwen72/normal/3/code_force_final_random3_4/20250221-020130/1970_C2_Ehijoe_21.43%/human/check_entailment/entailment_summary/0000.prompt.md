Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Functions with Execution Summary:
from functools import reduce
import math
from collections import deque, defaultdict

t = 1
for i in range(t):
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(nodes, start, parent=None):
    if len(nodes[start]) == 1 and nodes[start][0] == parent:
        return [0]
    distances = []
    for node in nodes[start]:
        if node != parent:
            distances.extend([1 + dist for dist in func_1(nodes, node, start)])
    return distances
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `nodes` representing a tree, an integer `start` representing the starting node, and an integer or `None` `parent` representing the parent node. It returns a list of distances from the `start` node to all other nodes in the tree that are reachable from `start` and not equal to `parent`, incremented by 1. If the `start` node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one adjacent node which is its parent), the function returns a list containing the single element 0. The `nodes` list and the `parent` variable remain unchanged.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    (n, t) = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
        nodes[u].append(v)
        nodes[v].append(u)
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves]):
        print('Ron')
    else:
        print('Hermione')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` from the input, then constructs a dictionary `nodes` representing a graph where each key is a node and each value is a list of its adjacent nodes based on the input edges. It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one adjacent node) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. The function then reads an integer `start` from the input, calls `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` to compute a list of integers `moves` representing the number of moves from the start node to each leaf node. Finally, it prints 'Ron' if at least one element in `moves` is an odd number, otherwise it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `edges` is still an empty list, `nodes` contains the adjacency information of the graph, `start` is the input start node, `moves` contains the number of moves from the start node to each leaf node, and `leaves` is a deque containing all leaf nodes.
