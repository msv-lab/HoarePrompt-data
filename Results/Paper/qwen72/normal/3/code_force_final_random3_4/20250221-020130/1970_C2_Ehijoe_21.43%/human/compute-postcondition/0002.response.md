Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `t` = 1, `edges` is an empty list, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the key node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= `start` <= `n`, `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves from the `start` node to each leaf node, `empty` is True.**
