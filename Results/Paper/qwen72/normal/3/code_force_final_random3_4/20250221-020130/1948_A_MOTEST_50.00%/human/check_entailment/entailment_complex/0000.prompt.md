Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case, the console screen is cleared, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, if `n` was 1, 'NO' was printed. If `n` was greater than 1, 'YES' was printed followed by a string `ans` constructed as follows: if `n` was even, `ans` contains each of the first `n // 2` letters of `s` repeated twice; if `n` was odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then contains each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of `s` repeated twice.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It clears the console screen and then reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the user. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed such that if `n` is even, it contains each of the first `n // 2` letters of the uppercase English alphabet repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then contains each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet repeated twice. The function executes this process `t` times.
