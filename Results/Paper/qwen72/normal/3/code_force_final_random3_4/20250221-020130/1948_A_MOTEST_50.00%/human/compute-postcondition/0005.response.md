The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function might be designed to work within a context where `t` and `n` are integers within the range 1 to 50. Without further details on the function's output, it's not possible to describe what the function returns. 

If we assume that the function is supposed to return some value based on these constraints, we need more information about the expected output to accurately describe the functionality. For now, the functionality can only be described as:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified based on the given information.**
