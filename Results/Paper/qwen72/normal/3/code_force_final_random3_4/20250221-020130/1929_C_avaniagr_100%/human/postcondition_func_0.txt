The function reads input from standard input, processes each line as a test case, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The function processes each test case by extracting integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input, and determines if `a` meets certain criteria relative to `k` and `x`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program is ready to terminate or move on to the next part of the code.
