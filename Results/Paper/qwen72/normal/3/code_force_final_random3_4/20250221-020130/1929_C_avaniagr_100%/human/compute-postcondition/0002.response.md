Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.**
