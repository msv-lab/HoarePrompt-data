Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program computes the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, but this does not necessarily give the maximum beauty of the array as defined by the problem statement.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any order. To maximize this beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending or descending order. When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized.

Here is the correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Sort the array.
2. Compute the beauty of the array as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct way to maximize the beauty of the array.
