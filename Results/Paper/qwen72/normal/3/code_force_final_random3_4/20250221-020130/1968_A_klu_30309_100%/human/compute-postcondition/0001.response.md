The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must not be empty because the loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`. The variable `x` will take the value of the first element in `test_cases` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x in the list satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
