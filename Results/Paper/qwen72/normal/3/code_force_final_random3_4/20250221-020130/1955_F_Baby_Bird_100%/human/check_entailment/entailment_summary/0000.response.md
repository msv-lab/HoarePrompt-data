### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - The bitwise XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the sequence can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has a zero XOR as often as possible.
   - The key is to balance the counts of the numbers to ensure that the XOR can be zero after each removal.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum(3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Here, `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of each number, and `x % 2` gives the remainder (0 or 1).
   - The term `x % 2 * (i < 3)` ensures that if there is an odd count of 1, 2, or 3, it contributes to the sum, but not for 4.
   - The sum is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: `1 1 1 0`**
     - Counts: 1 one, 1 two, 1 three, 0 fours.
     - Calculation: \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times (0 + 0 + 0) + 1 + 1 + 1}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{3}{3} \right\rfloor = 1\)
     - Correct: Bob wins once when the sequence is `[1, 2, 3]`.

   - **Example 2: `1 0 1 2`**
     - Counts: 1 one, 0 twos, 1 three, 2 fours.
     - Calculation: \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times (0 + 0 + 0 + 1) + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{3 + 2}{3} \right\rfloor = 1\)
     - Correct: Bob wins once when the sequence is `[1, 3, 4, 4]`.

   - **Example 3: `2 2 2 0`**
     - Counts: 2 ones, 2 twos, 2 threes, 0 fours.
     - Calculation: \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times (1 + 1 + 1) + 0 + 0 + 0}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{9}{3} \right\rfloor = 3\)
     - Correct: Bob wins three times when the sequence is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.

   - **Example 4: `3 3 2 0`**
     - Counts: 3 ones, 3 twos, 2 threes, 0 fours.
     - Calculation: \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times (1 + 1 + 1) + 1 + 1 + 0}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{9 + 2}{3} \right\rfloor = 3\)
     - Correct: Bob wins three times when the sequence is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.

   - **Example 5: `0 9 9 9`**
     - Counts: 0 ones, 9 twos, 9 threes, 9 fours.
     - Calculation: \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times (4 + 4 + 3) + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{36 + 2}{3} \right\rfloor = 12\)
     - Correct: Bob wins twelve times when the sequence is `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
