The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, and each test case includes a list `p_i` of four integers (each between 0 and 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. The function returns a result for each test case based on the counts provided in `p_i`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and a list `p_i` of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. It returns a result for each test case based on these counts.**
