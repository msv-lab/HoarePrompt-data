The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a number of test cases `t`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. For each of these `t` test cases, the function processes another integer `n`, where 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3, and returns a result for each test case.**
