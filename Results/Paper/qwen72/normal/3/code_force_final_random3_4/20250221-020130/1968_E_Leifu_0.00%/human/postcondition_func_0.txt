The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3. The function prints the pairs '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. Otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of integers (j, j) for each `j` ranging from 4 to `n`. The function does not return any value, and the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.
