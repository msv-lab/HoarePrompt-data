You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')
        
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')

    #State: t is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The loop has finished executing, and the values of t and n remain unchanged. The loop has printed '1 1', '1 2', and depending on the value of n, either '2 3' if n == 3, or '2 4' followed by pairs of integers (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3. The function prints the pairs '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. Otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of integers (j, j) for each `j` ranging from 4 to `n`. The function does not return any value, and the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints a set of `n` points.
   - The points are chosen as follows:
     - The first point is always \((1, 1)\).
     - The second point is always \((1, 2)\).
     - If `n == 3`, the third point is \((2, 3)\).
     - If `n > 3`, the third point is \((2, 4)\), and the remaining points are \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to `n`.

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of `n`:**
   - **For \(n = 2\):**
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\)
     - Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{1\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H} = 1\)
     - **Expected Size:** 2 (since the distance between the same point is 0, and the distance between different points is 1)
     - **Conclusion:** The program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\).

   - **For \(n = 3\):**
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\)
     - Distances:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-3| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-1| = 1\)
       - \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
     - Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H} = 3\)
     - **Expected Size:** 3 (since the distances are 0, 1, 2, and 3)
     - **Conclusion:** The program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\).

   - **For \(n = 4\):**
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\)
     - Distances:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)

       - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
       - \(|2-4| + |2-4| = 4\)
     - Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H} = 5\)
     - **Expected Size:** 6 (since the distances are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6)
     - **Conclusion:** The program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\).

   - **For \(n = 5\):**
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\)
     - Distances:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |1-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-1| + |1-5| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-5| = 5\)
       - \(|1-4| + |1-5| = 7\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-5| = 4\)
       - \(|1-4| + |2-5| = 6\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-5| = 3\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
       - \(|2-5| + |4-5| = 4\)
       - \(|4-5| + |5-5| = 1\)
     - Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H} = 7\)
     - **Expected Size:** 8 (since the distances are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7)
     - **Conclusion:** The program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\).

   - **For \(n = 6\):**
     - Points: \((1, 4)\), \((1, 5)\), \((1, 6)\), \((5, 2)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 1)\)
     - Distances:
       - \(|1-1| + |4-5| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |4-6| = 2\)
       - \(|1-5| + |4-2| = 5\)

       - \(|5-6| + |2-1| = 2\)
       - \(|5-6| + |5-1| = 5\)
       - \(|5-6| + |5-5| = 1\)
       - \(|6-6| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H} = 6\)
     - **Expected Size:** 9 (since the distances are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8)
     - **Conclusion:** The program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 6\).

### Conclusion:
The program does not consistently maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, it fails to maximize the set for \(n = 2\), \(n = 4\), \(n = 5\), and \(n = 6\).
