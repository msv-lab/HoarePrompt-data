Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. Specifically, the program only prints a fixed pattern of points, which does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

For example, when \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |1-3|, |1-2| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |2-3|, |2-2| + |1-3|\} = \{0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2\}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, which is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\). The maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is 4, as shown in the problem description.

Similarly, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |1-4|, |1-4| + |1-4|, |1-2| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |2-4|, |1-4| + |1-2|, |1-4| + |2-4|, |2-2| + |1-4|, |2-4| + |1-4|\} = \{0, 1, 3, 6, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 6, which is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\). The maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 10.

Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases, and hence it is incorrect.
