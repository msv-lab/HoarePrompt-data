Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the MEX operation. Let's break down the issues in the code:

1. **MEX Calculation Missing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray by applying the MEX operation. However, it does not actually calculate the MEX of the subarray.
   - Instead, it calculates a value that is the square of the length of the subarray and then tries to maximize this value through recursive calls. This is not the correct approach to find the MEX and apply it to the subarray.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum. However, it relies on the incorrect values computed by `func_1`.
   - The condition `if max_value == length ** 2` is not a valid check for determining whether the MEX operation has been applied correctly. The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and this is not captured by the current logic.

3. **`make_stairs` Function**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is meant to transform a subarray into a "stair" pattern, but it does not align with the MEX operation.
   - The function checks if the subarray already forms a sequence from 0 to `i`, and if not, it sets all elements in the subarray to `i`. This is not the correct way to apply the MEX operation, which should set elements to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     1 100 2 1
     ```
     The expected output is:
     ```
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
     However, the provided program will not produce this output because it does not correctly compute the MEX and apply it to the subarray.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, `func_1` should compute the MEX of the subarray and then apply it to the elements of the subarray.
   - The MEX of a subarray can be computed by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - `func_2` should then construct the sequence of operations based on the correct MEX values.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program does not correctly implement the required logic.

Final: **False**
