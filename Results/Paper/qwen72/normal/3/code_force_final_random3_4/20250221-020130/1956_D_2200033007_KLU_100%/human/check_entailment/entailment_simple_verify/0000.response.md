Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the MEX operation. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray by applying the MEX operation. However, it does not actually compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it calculates a value that is the square of the length of the subarray and then tries to maximize this value by recursively calling itself on different subarrays. This does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. The function `func_1` does not perform this calculation.

2. **Incorrect Use of `make_stairs`**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern, where each element is set to its index. However, this transformation is not relevant to the MEX operation as described in the problem.
   - The function `make_stairs` is called in `func_2` when the maximum value is equal to the square of the length of the subarray. This condition is not a valid criterion for applying the MEX operation, and the transformation performed by `make_stairs` does not help in maximizing the sum of the elements of the array using the MEX operation.

3. **Incorrect Recursion in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to construct a sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum. However, it relies on the incorrect values computed by `func_1` and the irrelevant transformations performed by `make_stairs`.
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly identify the subarrays where the MEX operation should be applied to maximize the sum.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The provided examples and the expected outputs are not achieved by the program, and the logic does not align with the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
