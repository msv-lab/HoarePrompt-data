Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer (specifically `i - 1`), `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` has been appended to `res`.**
