Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer and equals 0, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, `res` now contains one more tuple: (`start_index`, `start_index`).**
