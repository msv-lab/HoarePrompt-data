The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `testcases`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `testcases` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop will execute.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `_` is not relevant**
