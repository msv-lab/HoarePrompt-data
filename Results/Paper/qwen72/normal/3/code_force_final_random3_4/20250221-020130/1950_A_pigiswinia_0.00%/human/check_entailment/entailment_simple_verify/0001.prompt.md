You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the loop will have printed 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each of the `t` test cases based on the conditions provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - A **stair** is defined as `a < b < c`.
   - A **peak** is defined as `a < b > c`.
   - If neither condition is met, the output should be "NONE".

3. **Output**:
   - The program uses `if` and `elif` statements to check the conditions for a stair and a peak.
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIRS".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

4. **Case Sensitivity**:
   - The problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" (without quotes). However, the program prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" for the stair condition. This is a discrepancy.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `0 0 0` correctly by outputting "NONE".
   - It also correctly handles cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak, such as `4 1 7`.

Given the discrepancy in the output string for the stair condition, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
