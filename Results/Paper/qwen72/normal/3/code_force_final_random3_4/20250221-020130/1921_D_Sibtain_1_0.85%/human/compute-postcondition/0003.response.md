Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `c` (renamed from `a_i` and `b_i` in the annotations). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the sum of the absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and the reverse-sorted list `c`. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same, it prints `0`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` retain their initial values, but the internal variables `a`, `c`, `i`, and `ans` are reset for each test case. **
