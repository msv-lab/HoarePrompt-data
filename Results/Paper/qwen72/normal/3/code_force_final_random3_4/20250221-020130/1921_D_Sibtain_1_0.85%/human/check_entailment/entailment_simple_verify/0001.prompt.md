You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the calculated value of `ans`. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` retain their initial values, but the internal variables `a`, `c`, `i`, and `ans` are reset for each test case. The final state of the loop is that all test cases have been processed, and the corresponding `ans` values have been printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `c`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal. If so, it prints `0` because the maximum difference is zero.
   - This check is necessary to handle the special case where no difference can be achieved.

3. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The function sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `c` in descending order.
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order helps in maximizing the absolute differences between corresponding elements.

4. **Special Case for Single Element:**
   - If `a` has only one element, the function calculates the maximum difference between this element and the largest or smallest element in `c`.
   - This is correct because for a single element, the maximum difference is achieved by comparing it to the extreme values in `c`.

5. **General Case for Multiple Elements:**
   - The function uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate through the arrays and calculate the total difference.
   - The first loop runs from `0` to `n // 2` and adds the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` to the total difference `ans`.
   - The second loop runs from `n // 2` to `n` and adds the maximum of the absolute differences between `a[i]` and the corresponding elements in `c` (either `c[i]` or `c[j]`).

6. **Pointer Initialization and Iteration:**
   - The pointer `i` is initialized to `0` and incremented in both loops.
   - The pointer `j` is initialized to `len(c) - len(a) + i` and incremented in the second loop.
   - This ensures that the elements in `c` are used optimally to maximize the differences.

7. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where all elements in `a` and `c` are the same.
- The sorting strategy ensures that the differences are maximized by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c` and vice versa.
- The special case for a single element in `a` is handled correctly by comparing it to the extreme values in `c`.
- The general case for multiple elements uses a two-pointer approach to ensure that the differences are maximized.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and will produce the maximum total difference `D` for each test case as described in the problem.
