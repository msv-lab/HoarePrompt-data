Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is 0, `best` is the maximum float value, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
