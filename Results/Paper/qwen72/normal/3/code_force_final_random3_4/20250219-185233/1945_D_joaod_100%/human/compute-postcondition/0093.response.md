Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers input by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all iterations where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0.
- For each iteration, `total` is updated by adding the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
- If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is updated to the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`.
- After the loop completes, `v` will be -1 because the loop decrements `v` until it reaches -1.
- `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs for all iterations.
- `best` will be the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all iterations where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.
