Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is 0, `best` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.** 

The value of `best` is updated to be the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
