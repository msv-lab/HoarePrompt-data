Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least -1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum total cost of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`**: These variables remain unchanged from their initial state because they are not modified within the loop.
- **`v`**: After the loop completes, `v` will be -1 because the loop iterates from `na_frente` down to -1 (inclusive) with a step of -1.
- **`total`**: This variable accumulates the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0. This means that for each iteration, the loop adds the smaller of the two costs to `total`.
- **`best`**: This variable is updated to the minimum total cost of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If no such `v` exists (i.e., `na_frente` is less than `pos_final`), `best` remains the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`). Otherwise, `best` will be the smallest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.
