Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- **`cases`**: Remains an input integer greater than 0.
- **`c`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`na_frente`**: Remains at least 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.
- **`pos_final`**: Remains an input integer minus 1, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`custo_pra_trocar_a`**: Remains a list of integers, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`custo_pra_passar_b`**: Remains a list of integers, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`v`**: After the loop completes, `v` will be -1, as the loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0.
- **`total`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0.
- **`best`**: This variable is updated to the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` ≤ `pos_final`. If no such `v` is found, `best` remains the maximum float value.
