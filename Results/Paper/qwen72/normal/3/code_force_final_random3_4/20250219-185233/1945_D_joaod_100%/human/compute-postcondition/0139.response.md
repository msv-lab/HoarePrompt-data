Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the new `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, but `best` remains the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`).**
