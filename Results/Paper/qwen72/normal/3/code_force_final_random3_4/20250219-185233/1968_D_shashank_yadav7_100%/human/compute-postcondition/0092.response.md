Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -3 or decreased by 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice, `sp` is further increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` again.**

In natural language:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2.
- `k` remains -3 or is decreased by 3.
- `b` remains `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` remains `p[s] - 1`.
- `bm` is still updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `sm` is still updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
- `sp` is still increased by `a[s]`.
- `bp` is now increased by `a[b]` three times (twice from the initial state plus one more from the executed code).
- `sp` is further increased by `a[s]` (once from the initial state and once from the executed code).
