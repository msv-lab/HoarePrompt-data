t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. p is a permutation of length n, containing integers from 1 to n. a is an array of length n, containing integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
