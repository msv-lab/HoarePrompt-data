### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha (`bp` and `sp`) based on their starting positions.
   - It also initializes the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) based on the starting positions and the number of turns `k`.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns. However, it uses a loop that iterates `n` times, which is incorrect. The loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times.
   - Inside the loop, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha (`b` and `s`) based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) and the current scores (`bp` and `sp`).

4. **Loop Break Condition:**
   - The loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, which is correct. However, the loop should not decrement `k` inside the loop; instead, it should use a loop that runs exactly `k` times.

5. **Score Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores (`bm` and `sm`) and prints the result accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Loop Iteration:**
  - The loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times. This is a critical error because the game duration is `k` turns, and the loop should reflect this.
- **Score Calculation:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`). The maximum possible score should be the sum of the scores collected over `k` turns, not the product of the current score and the remaining turns.
- **Loop Break Condition:**
  - The loop should not decrement `k` inside the loop. Instead, it should use a loop that runs exactly `k` times.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, P_B, P_S = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        P_B -= 1
        P_S -= 1
        
        sp = 0
        bp = 0
        
        b = P_B
        s = P_S
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- **False**

The original program has logical errors in the loop iteration and score calculation, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output for the given problem.
