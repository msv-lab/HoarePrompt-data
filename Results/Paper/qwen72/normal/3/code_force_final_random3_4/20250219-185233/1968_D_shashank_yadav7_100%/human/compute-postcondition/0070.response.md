Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1 or decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
