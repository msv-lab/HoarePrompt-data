Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2 or decreased by 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so if it was initially -1, it becomes -2.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The updates to `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` are still valid as they were in the initial state, but `k` is now -2, which will affect the calculations involving `k`.
