You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the initial value of `n`, `t` is the initial value of `t`, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations (or -1 if the loop breaks early), `b` is the final position of `b` after all iterations (or the position when `k` reaches 0), `s` is the final position of `s` after all iterations (or the position when `k` reaches 0), `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each `s` during the loop, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop breaks and `bm` and `sm` are set to -1. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their movements and the values in the permutation `p` and array `a`. The function then prints the result of the game for each test case: 'Bodya' if Bodya's maximum score is greater, 'Sasha' if Sasha's maximum score is greater, and 'Draw' if their scores are equal. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` by multiplying the current score by `k` and then adding the current position's score. This approach does not correctly simulate the game's rules, where the score is simply incremented by the value at the current position in the array `a` on each turn.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the game lasts for `k` turns. The loop that simulates the game only runs for `k-1` iterations, which can lead to incorrect results if the game is supposed to last exactly `k` turns.

Here's a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Draw
```

In this example, Bodya starts at position 3 and Sasha starts at position 2. The permutation `p` is `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and the array `a` is `[7, 2, 5, 6]`. The game lasts for 2 turns.

**Correct Simulation:**
- **Turn 1:**
  - Bodya's position: 3, score: 0 + 5 = 5, move to 2 (since `p[3] = 2`)
  - Sasha's position: 2, score: 0 + 2 = 2, move to 1 (since `p[2] = 1`)
- **Turn 2:**
  - Bodya's position: 2, score: 5 + 2 = 7, move to 1 (since `p[2] = 1`)
  - Sasha's position: 1, score: 2 + 7 = 9, stay at 1

After 2 turns, Bodya's score is 7 and Sasha's score is 9, so Sasha should win. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" because of the flawed score calculation logic.
