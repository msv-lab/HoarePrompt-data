Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1` or the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0.
   - `k` is `k - n` or `k` is -1.
   - `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times or until `k` reaches 0).
   - `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times or until `k` reaches 0).
   - `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each `b` and `k` during the loop.
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each `s` and `k` during the loop.
   - `sp` is increased by the sum of `a[s]` for each `s` during the loop.
   - `bp` is increased by the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop.
   - `bm` is equal to or greater than `sm`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Draw')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is a simple string output: `'Draw'`.
   - The initial state describes a complex set of conditions and operations involving variables `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`.
   - However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or their values. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **Draw**
