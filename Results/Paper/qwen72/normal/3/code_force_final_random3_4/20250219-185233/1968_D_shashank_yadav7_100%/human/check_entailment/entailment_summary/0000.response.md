Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the "Permutation game" problem by simulating the game for each player and calculating their scores over `k` turns. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Scores:**
   - The program initializes `bm` and `sm` as the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, by multiplying the initial score by `k`. This is incorrect because the maximum score is not simply the initial score multiplied by `k`. Instead, it should be the sum of the scores accumulated over `k` turns.
   - The program then iterates `k` times, updating the positions and scores for both players. However, the way it updates the maximum scores (`bm` and `sm`) is flawed. It uses the formula `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, which is not correct. The maximum score should be the sum of the scores at each position over the turns.

2. **Incorrect Position Updates:**
   - The program updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`. This is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-indexed, and the positions should be updated directly to `p[b]` and `p[s]` without subtracting 1.

3. **Inefficient Loop:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` is not necessary. The game lasts for `k` turns, so the loop should be `for i in range(k)`.

4. **Incorrect Final Score Comparison:**
   - The final scores `bm` and `sm` should be the accumulated scores after `k` turns, not the maximum possible scores. The program should simply compare the accumulated scores `bp` and `sp` after `k` turns.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
