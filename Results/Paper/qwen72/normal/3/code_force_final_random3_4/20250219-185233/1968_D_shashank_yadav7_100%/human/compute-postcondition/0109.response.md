Output State: **`i` is `n` (the new value of `n` from input), `t` must be greater than `n` (the new value of `n` from input), `k` is the new value of `k` from input, `b` is the new value of `b` from input minus 1, `s` is the new value of `s` from input minus 1, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each `b` and `k` during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each `s` and `k` during the loop, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
