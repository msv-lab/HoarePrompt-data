Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1, `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and all subsequent elements until a repeated index is found in `vis`, `paths` is an empty list, `pb` is the index of the repeated element in `vis` or the last element in `pathb` if no repetition is found.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1, `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements and now includes the element `a[ps - 1]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and all subsequent elements until a repeated index is found in `vis`, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`, `pb` is the index of the repeated element in `vis` or the last element in `pathb` if no repetition is found, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`. If the element at index `ps - 1` in `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1, `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths) + 1` elements and now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and all subsequent elements until a repeated index is found in `vis`, `paths` is a list containing the elements `a[ps - 1]` and the newly appended `a[ps - 1]`, `pb` is the index of the repeated element in `vis` or the last element in `pathb` if no repetition is found, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`. If the element at index `ps - 1` in `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `p[ps - 1] - 1` which is 1, `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths) + 1` elements and now includes the element `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]` appended to it, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and all subsequent elements until a repeated index is found in `vis`, `paths` is a list containing the elements `a[ps - 1]` and the newly appended `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `pb` is the index of the repeated element in `vis` or the last element in `pathb` if no repetition is found, `ps` is now `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
