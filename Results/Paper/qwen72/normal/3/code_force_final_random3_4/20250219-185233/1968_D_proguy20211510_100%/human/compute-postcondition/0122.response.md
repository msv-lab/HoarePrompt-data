Output State: **`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `pb - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the elements at indices visited during the loop set to 1, `pb` is the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index.**

### Explanation:
- **`p`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the next index.
- **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress`**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used to append elements to `pathb`.
- **`pathb`**: This list contains the elements from `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `pb - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a previously visited index is encountered again.
- **`paths`**: Remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`vis`**: This list is updated to mark the indices that have been visited during the loop. Each index that is visited is set to 1.
- **`pb`**: After the loop completes, `pb` is the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index, indicating the end of the cycle.
