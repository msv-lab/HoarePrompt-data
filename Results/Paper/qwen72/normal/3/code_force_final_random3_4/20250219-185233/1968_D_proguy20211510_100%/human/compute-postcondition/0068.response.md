Output State: **`preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`, `i` is `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`, `curr` is the last computed value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` before the loop terminates. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ress`, and `pres` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- `preb` is updated to the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`.
- `resb` is updated to the maximum value of the expression `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`.
- `i` is the index of the last element processed in `pathb`, which is `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`.
- `curr` is the last computed value of the expression `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` before the loop terminates.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ress`, and `pres` remain unchanged from their initial values.
