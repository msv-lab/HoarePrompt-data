Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are part of the same cycle in the permutation. In such cases, the logic for determining the optimal score for each player can be incorrect because the program does not account for the possibility that the players might revisit the same positions multiple times within the cycle during the game.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 1 2
2 3 4 1
10 20 30 40
```
In this case:
- The permutation is `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- The array `a` is `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
- Bodya starts at position 1, and Sasha starts at position 2.
- The game lasts for 2 turns.

The correct output should be:
```
Sasha
```
However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
Bodya
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the cycle in the permutation where both players will revisit the same positions multiple times. The logic for calculating the scores within the cycle is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
