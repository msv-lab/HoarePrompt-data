Output State: **`pres` is updated to `pres + paths[0]`, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `curr`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
