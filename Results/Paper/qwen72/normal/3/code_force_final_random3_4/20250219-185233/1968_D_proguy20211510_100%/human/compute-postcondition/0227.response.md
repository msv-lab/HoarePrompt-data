Output State: **`vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1, `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths) + 1` elements and now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and all subsequent elements until a repeated index is found in `vis`, `paths` is a list containing the elements `a[ps - 1]` and the newly appended `a[ps - 1]`, `pb` is the index of the repeated element in `vis` or the last element in `pathb` if no repetition is found, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`. If the element at index `ps - 1` in `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
