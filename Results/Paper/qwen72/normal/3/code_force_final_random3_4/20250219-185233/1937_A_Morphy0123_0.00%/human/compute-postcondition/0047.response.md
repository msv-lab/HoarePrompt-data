To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n_cases` is greater than 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `power` is 3.

3. **Evaluating the Condition**:
   - We need to ensure that `power < log2(n)` is true for the next iteration.
   - Currently, `power` is 3.
   - Therefore, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The value of `n` must be such that `log2(n) > 3`.
   - Since `log2(n) > 3` implies `n > 2^3`, which means `n > 8`.

### Final State:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 8. The other variables (`i` and `n_cases`) are not relevant to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
