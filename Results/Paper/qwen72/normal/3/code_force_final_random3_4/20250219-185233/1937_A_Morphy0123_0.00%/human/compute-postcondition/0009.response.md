The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)`.

Given that `power` is 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. This means `n` must be greater than 4 (since `log2(4) = 2`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 4.
State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 2**
