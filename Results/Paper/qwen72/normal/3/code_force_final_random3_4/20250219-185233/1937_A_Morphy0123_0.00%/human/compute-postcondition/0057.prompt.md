Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that it should be called with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array `a`, and the function should internally handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`. `n_cases` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        while power < log2(n):
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the current value of `n` remains 1. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. If `power` is equal to `n`, the current value of `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than 2^(power-1). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains the smallest integer such that 2^power >= n. If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is one less than the smallest integer such that 2^power >= n.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\) if `power` is equal to `n`, or greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\) if `power` is not equal to `n`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\). If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is updated to \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
