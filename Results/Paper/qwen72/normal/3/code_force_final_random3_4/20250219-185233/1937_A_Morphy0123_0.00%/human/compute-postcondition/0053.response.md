Output State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\), `power` is \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\), and `power` is not equal to `n`**

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `power` is \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\). Consequently, the condition `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\) is updated to `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
