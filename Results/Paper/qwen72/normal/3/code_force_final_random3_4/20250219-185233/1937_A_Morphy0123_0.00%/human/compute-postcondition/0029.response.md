To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head condition: `power < log2(n)`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1
- `n_cases` is greater than 1
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `power` is 3

### Loop Condition:
- The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`.

2. **Check the Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `power` is less than `log2(n)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `power` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3.

3. **Determine the Required Value for `n`:**
   - `log2(n) > 3` implies `n > 2^3`.
   - `2^3 = 8`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 8.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The current state says `n` must be greater than 4, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 8.
   - No other states need to be adjusted.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
