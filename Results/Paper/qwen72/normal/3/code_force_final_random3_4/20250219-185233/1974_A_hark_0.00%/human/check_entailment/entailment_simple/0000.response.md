### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is a simple comparison function that returns the smaller of two values. It is not used in the main logic of the program, so we can ignore it for the correctness check.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The function then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - Calculate `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
       - Update `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step is intended to account for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this formula is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the space left after placing 2x2 icons.
       - Calculate `bxsfory1` as 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise as `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. This step is also incorrect because adding 1 to the ceiling value is not necessary.
       - Print the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - Print the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - Print the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - Print 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_2()` for each test case.
   - The state after the function call is that `func_2()` has been called `t` times, and the results for each test case have been printed.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Formula in `func_2`**:
  - The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so placing `bxsfory` 2x2 icons leaves `15 - 4 * bxsfory` cells for 1x1 icons.
  - The formula `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` to correctly calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0):
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 11  # Corrected formula
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)  # Corrected formula
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    else:
        if (x == 0 and y > 0):
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        else:
            if (x > 0 and y == 0):
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
            else:
                print(0)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

### Correctness:
- The original program contains logical errors in the formula used to calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
