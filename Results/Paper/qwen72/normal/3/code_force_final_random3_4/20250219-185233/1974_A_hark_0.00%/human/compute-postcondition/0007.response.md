Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, and `func_2()` has been called `t` times.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged from the initial state because the loop does not modify `t`.
- **`_`**: The placeholder variable `_` is incremented with each iteration of the loop. After all `t` iterations, `_` will be `t-1` because the loop starts at 0 and iterates up to `t-1`.
- **`func_2()`**: The function `func_2()` is called `t` times, once for each iteration of the loop.
