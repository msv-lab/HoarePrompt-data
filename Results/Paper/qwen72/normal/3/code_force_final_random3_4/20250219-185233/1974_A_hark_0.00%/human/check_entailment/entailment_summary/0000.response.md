### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values. It is not directly used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not critical to the overall solution. However, it is a well-defined and correct function for its purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of screens required for a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - The function first checks if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. If so, it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`), which is the ceiling of `y / 2`. This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so you can fit 3.75 2x2 icons per screen, but you need to round up to ensure all icons are placed.
   - It then updates `x` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons. The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is used to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. This formula is derived from the fact that each screen can hold 15 1x1 icons, and each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells.
   - If the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, it means all 1x1 icons can fit on the screens already used for 2x2 icons, so `bxsfory1` is set to 0. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons as `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
   - The function then prints the total number of screens required, which is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases, ensuring that `func_2` is called the correct number of times.

### Correctness:

- The logic in `func_2` for calculating the number of screens needed for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons appears to be correct. The formula for updating `x` and calculating the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is derived from the problem constraints and seems to handle all edge cases.
- The function `func_3` correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_2` for each one.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
