Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are assigned the values of two input integers, each between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If at least one of `x` or `y` is 0 or less, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, except in the case where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, in which case `y` remains 0.***
