Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are assigned the values of two input integers, each between 0 and 99 (inclusive), and at least one of `x` or `y` is 0 or less. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains greater than 0. Otherwise, either `x` is not 0, or `y` is 0 or less. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `y` remains 0. In all other cases, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.***
