The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
