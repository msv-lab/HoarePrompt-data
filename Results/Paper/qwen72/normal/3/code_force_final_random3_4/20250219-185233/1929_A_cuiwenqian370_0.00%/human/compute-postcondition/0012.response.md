Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `right` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `n - 2`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, and `left` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `new_arr` remains the same, but it will be evaluated with the updated value of `right`.
