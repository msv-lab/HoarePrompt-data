Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a modified list `new_arr`, which contains all elements of `arr` but arranged in a specific order: elements are paired from the largest to the smallest, with the largest element followed by the smallest, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` is appended to `new_arr` once. The final state of the program ensures that `new_arr` is a permutation of `arr` and the returned value is the computed sum of these absolute differences. **
