The value of `new_arr` is updated by appending the element at index `right` of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` initially contains the first element of `arr` and `arr[1]`. After appending `arr[right]`, `new_arr` will contain the first element of `arr`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[right]`.

If `left` is not equal to `right`, `new_arr` initially contains the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and `arr[left]`. After appending `arr[right]`, `new_arr` will contain the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[right]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`, if `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[right]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[right]`.**
