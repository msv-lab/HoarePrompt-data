Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not aim to maximize the beauty of the array by simply alternating the largest and smallest elements. Instead, it aims to maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a specific way that is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Let's analyze the function `func_1` step-by-step:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The function starts by sorting the array `arr`. This ensures that the elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: The function then creates a new array `new_arr` by alternately appending the largest and smallest elements from the sorted array. This means that the largest element is followed by the smallest, the second largest by the second smallest, and so on.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The function calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

The key insight here is that the rearrangement strategy used by `func_1` is designed to maximize the sum of the absolute differences. By placing the largest and smallest elements next to each other, the function ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Let's verify this with the example provided in the original assessment:

- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 6

- **Function Execution**:
  - **Sorted Array**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - **Rearranged Array**: `[4, 1, 3, 2]`
  - **Beauty Calculation**:
    - `|4 - 1| = 3`
    - `|1 - 3| = 2`
    - `|3 - 2| = 1`
    - **Total Beauty**: `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`

The function correctly calculates the maximum beauty for this example. Let's consider another example to further validate the function:

- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  5
  100 54 80 43 90
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 57

- **Function Execution**:
  - **Sorted Array**: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - **Rearranged Array**: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
  - **Beauty Calculation**:
    - `|100 - 43| = 57`
    - `|43 - 90| = 47`
    - `|90 - 54| = 36`
    - `|54 - 80| = 26`
    - **Total Beauty**: `57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166`

However, the expected output is 57, which suggests that the problem might be misinterpreted. The correct approach should be to maximize the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`, not the absolute differences. This means the function should aim to maximize the positive differences.

Given this, the correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, but in reverse order (from the largest to the smallest). This ensures that the differences are maximized.

Let's correct the function and re-evaluate:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += arr[i-1] - arr[i]
    return max_beauty
```

- **Function Summary**:
  - The function `func_1` sorts the array in descending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This ensures that the differences are maximized and positive.

- **Re-evaluation**:
  - For the input:
    ```
    3
    4
    1 2 3 4
    ```
    - **Sorted Array (Descending)**: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`
    - **Beauty Calculation**:
      - `4 - 3 = 1`
      - `3 - 2 = 1`
      - `2 - 1 = 1`
      - **Total Beauty**: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

  - For the input:
    ```
    3
    5
    100 54 80 43 90
    ```
    - **Sorted Array (Descending)**: `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]`
    - **Beauty Calculation**:
      - `100 - 90 = 10`
      - `90 - 80 = 10`
      - `80 - 54 = 26`
      - `54 - 43 = 11`
      - **Total Beauty**: `10 + 10 + 26 + 11 = 57`

The corrected function now correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem.

Final: **False**

The original assessment was correct in identifying that the program did not correctly calculate the maximum beauty. The function `func_1` in the original program was not designed to maximize the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})`, but rather the sum of the absolute differences. The corrected function, which sorts the array in descending order and calculates the differences, is the correct approach. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
