Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`, if `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and the element at index `left` of `arr`. The last element of `new_arr` is `arr[left]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `right` is decremented by 1, so `right` is now `n - 3`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, and `left` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `new_arr` is still valid, but the value of `right` has been updated. If `left` is equal to `right` (which is now `n - 3`), `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and the element at index `left` of `arr`, with the last element being `arr[left]`.
