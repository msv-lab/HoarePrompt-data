Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and the element at index `left` of `arr`. The last element of `new_arr` is `arr[left]`.***
