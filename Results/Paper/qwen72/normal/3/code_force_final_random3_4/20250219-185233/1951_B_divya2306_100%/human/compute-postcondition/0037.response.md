Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` and an integer `k`. The list `ratings` contains distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and `k` is the index of your cow. The function processes these inputs to determine the relative standing of your cow based on the ratings, but it does not return any value. The function is called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of `n` (the length of `ratings`) over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
