### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by calling the `func_1` function.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`, followed by the list of ratings `a`.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `wins` to 0 and iterates through the list `a` to count the number of consecutive cows with ratings less than or equal to the rating of your cow `a[k-1]`.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it encounters a cow with a higher rating, which is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Condition for No Swap**:
   - If the number of initial wins `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1` and returns. This is because if your cow can win at least `k` matches without any swap, it will win `k-1` matches (since the first match is between the first two cows).

4. **Wins Calculation with Swap**:
   - If `wins` is less than `k`, the program calculates the potential wins if your cow is swapped to a position where it can win more matches.
   - It initializes `win_with_swap` to `wins + 1` and iterates from `win_with_swap` to `k-1` to count the number of additional cows with ratings less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it encounters a cow with a higher rating, which is correct.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.
   - The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is used to calculate the number of additional wins after the swap, adjusted by whether the initial wins were non-zero.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for calculating the initial wins and the potential wins after a swap is correct.
- The final output correctly determines the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

However, there is a small issue in the final output calculation. The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` should be `win_with_swap - 1` to correctly reflect the number of wins after the swap. The current expression is overly complex and may not always give the correct result.

### Corrected Final Output:
```python
print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - 1))
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct, but the final output calculation is flawed. The corrected final output should be `print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - 1))` to ensure the maximum number of wins is correctly calculated.
