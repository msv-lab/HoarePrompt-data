Output State: **`ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[k - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
