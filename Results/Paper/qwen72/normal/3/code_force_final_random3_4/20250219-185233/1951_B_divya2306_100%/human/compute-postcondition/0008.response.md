The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the length `n` of the `ratings` list. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 1, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is 1, `i` is 1**
