Correctness: **False**

The provided code has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in Main Loop**: The main loop calls `func_1()` but the function is not defined before the loop. This will result in a `NameError` when the program is run.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Wins Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of wins without swapping is incorrect. It should check the number of consecutive wins starting from the cow in position `k`.
   - The logic for calculating the number of wins with a swap is also incorrect. It should consider the optimal position to swap the cow to maximize the number of wins.

3. **Handling of Swap Logic**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the swap logic. It should find the best position to swap the cow to maximize the number of wins, and then calculate the number of wins from that position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins(n, k, a):
    # Calculate the number of wins without swapping
    wins_without_swap = 0
    for i in range(k - 1, n - 1):
        if a[i] < a[i + 1]:
            break
        wins_without_swap += 1

    # Calculate the number of wins with a swap
    wins_with_swap = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i == k - 1:
            continue
        # Swap the cow to position i
        a[i], a[k - 1] = a[k - 1], a[i]
        # Calculate wins after the swap
        wins = 0
        for j in range(i, n - 1):
            if a[j] < a[j + 1]:
                break
            wins += 1
        # Restore the original order
        a[i], a[k - 1] = a[k - 1], a[i]
        # Update the maximum wins with swap
        wins_with_swap = max(wins_with_swap, wins)

    return max(wins_without_swap, wins_with_swap)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max_wins(n, k, a))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Wins Without Swap**:
   - We start from the cow in position `k` and count the number of consecutive wins until the cow loses.

2. **Wins With Swap**:
   - We iterate through all possible positions to swap the cow to.
   - For each position, we swap the cow to that position, calculate the number of wins, and then restore the original order.
   - We keep track of the maximum number of wins achieved with any swap.

3. **Final Output**:
   - We print the maximum number of wins between the wins without swap and the wins with the optimal swap.

This corrected version should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
