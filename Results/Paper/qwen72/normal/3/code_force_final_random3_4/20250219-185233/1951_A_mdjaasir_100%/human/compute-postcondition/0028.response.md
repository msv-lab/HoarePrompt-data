The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal `'YES'` provided in the statement.

Output: **YES**
