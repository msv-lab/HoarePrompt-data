Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, and `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. If `count` is 2 and the character following the first '1' in `a` is not '1', the postcondition remains unchanged. If `count` is 2 and the character following the first '1' is '1', the postcondition also remains unchanged. If `count` is not 2, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
