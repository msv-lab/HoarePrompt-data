The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `start` and `end` are integers where 0 <= start <= end, and the current working directory contains subfolders with names that can be interpreted as integers. The function returns a list of subfolder names (interpreted as integers) that fall within the range `[start, end]`.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names (interpreted as integers) within the current working directory that fall within the specified range `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` are integers and 0 <= start <= end.**
