Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, and `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. If `count` is 0, greater than 2 and even, 2 and the character following the first '1' in `a` is not '1', 2 and the character following the first '1' in `a` is '1', or not 2 or not even, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
