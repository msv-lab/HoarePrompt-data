To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `count` is 0, the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - If `count` is 2 and the character following the first '1' in `a` is not '1', the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - If `count` is 2 and the character following the first '1' is '1', the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - If `count` is not 2 or not even, the postcondition remains unchanged.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will always execute because none of the conditions change the postcondition. The `print` statement itself does not depend on any of the variables or conditions; it simply prints the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
