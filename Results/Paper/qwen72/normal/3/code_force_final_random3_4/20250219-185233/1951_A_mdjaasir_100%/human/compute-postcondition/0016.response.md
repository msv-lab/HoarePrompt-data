Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`, `count` is greater than 0, `count` is either less than or equal to 2, or `count` is odd, and the current value of `count` is 2. If the character immediately following the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not '1', the program continues with the given conditions. If the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is '1', the program also continues with the given conditions.***
