Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`, and `count` is greater than 0. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the program continues with these conditions. If `count` is 2, 1, or odd, the program also continues with these conditions.***
