The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `j` must start at `n - 1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`. This means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples
- `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `cards` is a list of integers input by the user
- `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0
- `i` is `n - 3`

We need to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, and `j` starts at `n - 1` and decrements to `-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 1`**
