The provided function definition is incomplete. However, based on the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases and the details of each test case as inputs. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in your hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
