Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, and `j` is n - 1. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is exactly 1, `dp[n-4][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[n-3][n-1]` and `dp[n-2][n-2] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.***
