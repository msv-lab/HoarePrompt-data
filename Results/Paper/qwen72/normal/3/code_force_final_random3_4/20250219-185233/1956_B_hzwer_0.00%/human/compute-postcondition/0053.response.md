The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `test_cases`, but the loop execution does not depend on `test_cases`. The loop execution depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 3` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 4`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 5`, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 to ensure that `i` remains within the valid range for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 5, and `j` is -1.**
