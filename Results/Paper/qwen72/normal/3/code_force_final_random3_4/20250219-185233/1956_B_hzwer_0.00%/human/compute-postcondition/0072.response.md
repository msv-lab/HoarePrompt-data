Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1), `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.** 

The value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
