Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following state is true:

- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `test_cases` remains a list of tuples.
- The variable `n` is still an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2.
- The variable `cards` is still a list of integers input by the user.
- The 2D list `dp` of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) is fully populated. Each element `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list:
  - If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`.
  - If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
  - If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- The loop variables `i` and `j` are both 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations from `i = n - 3` down to `i = 0` and from `j = n - 1` down to `j = 0`.

This final state represents the complete execution of the loop, where the `dp` table is fully computed based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
