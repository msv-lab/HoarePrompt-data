Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is n - 1, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically, `i` is still `n - 4`, `j` is still `n - 1`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is still 0. The 2D list `dp` retains its size and other elements, and the input variables `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `cards` remain as they were.
