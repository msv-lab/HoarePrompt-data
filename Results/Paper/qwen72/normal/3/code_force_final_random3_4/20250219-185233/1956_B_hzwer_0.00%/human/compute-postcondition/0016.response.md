The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order, starting from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to 0. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n]`. `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`.**
