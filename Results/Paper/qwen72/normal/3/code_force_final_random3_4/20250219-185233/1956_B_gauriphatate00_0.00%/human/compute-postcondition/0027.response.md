The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `results` must contain at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one result from `func_1(n, a)`. For the next iteration, `results` must contain at least two results, and `result` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least two results from `func_1(n, a)`, `result` is the second result in the list**
