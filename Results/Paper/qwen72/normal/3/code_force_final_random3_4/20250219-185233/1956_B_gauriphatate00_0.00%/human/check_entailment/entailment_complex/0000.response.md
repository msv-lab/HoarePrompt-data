### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of cards each player has) and `a` (the list of integers on the cards in your hand).
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) of integers that appear exactly twice in `a`.
   - The function returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`.

   The logic here is sound. The number of points you can get is determined by the number of pairs you have in your hand, but you can only score a maximum of `n // 2` points because Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. If you have more pairs than `n // 2`, Nene will ensure that you don't score more than `n // 2` points by playing her cards in a way that forces you to score fewer points.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cards each player has) and the list `a` (the integers on the cards in your hand).
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

   The function correctly handles the input and output format specified in the problem. It reads the input in the correct order and processes each test case independently. The results are stored and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are implemented correctly and meet the problem requirements. The logic in `func_1` is sound and the input/output handling in `func_2` is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
