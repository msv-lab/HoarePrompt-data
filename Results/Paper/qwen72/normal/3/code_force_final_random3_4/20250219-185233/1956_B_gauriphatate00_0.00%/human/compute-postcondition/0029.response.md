The only objects in the loop head are the list `results` and the variable `result`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If `results` has at least three items, the loop can execute again for the third item. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least two results from `func_1(n, a)`, and `result` is the second result in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least three results, and `result` will be the third result in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least three results from `func_1(n, a)`, `result` is the third result in the list**
