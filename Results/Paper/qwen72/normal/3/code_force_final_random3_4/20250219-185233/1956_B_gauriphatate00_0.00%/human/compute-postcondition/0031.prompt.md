Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `n` is the sum of the values of `n` for each iteration. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations. `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration. `a` is a list of `n` integers for the last iteration, starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing at least one result from `func_1(n, a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing at least two results from `func_1(n, a)`, `result` is the second result in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing at least three results from `func_1(n, a)`, `result` is the third result in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
