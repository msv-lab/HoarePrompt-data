Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value 1. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`. `results` is an empty list. No other variables are affected.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `2 + n`. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`. `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index 2 in `data`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `3 + n + n`. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1 - n]`. `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n` in `data`. `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. The result of `func_1(n, a)` is appended to the `results` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is now assigned the value `4 + n + 2 * n`. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than the new value of `_`. `n` is now assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`. `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`. `_` is incremented by 1. The result of `func_1(n, a)` is appended to `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
