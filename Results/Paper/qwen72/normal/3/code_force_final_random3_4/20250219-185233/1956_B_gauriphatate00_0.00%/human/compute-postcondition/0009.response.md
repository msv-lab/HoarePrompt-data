Output State: **`func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value 2. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. `results` is an empty list. `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx` in `data`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts the elements in `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` (exclusive) into integers and assigns them to the list `a`. The values of `data`, `idx`, `t`, `n`, and `results` remain unchanged. The new list `a` contains `n` integers starting from the element at index `2` in `data`.
