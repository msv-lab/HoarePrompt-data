Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of cards you have (`pairs`).
   - It returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score points for pairs of cards that you have, and you can only play `n // 2` turns optimally (since Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours).

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - It reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program correctly handles the input format and the logic for determining the maximum number of points you can get. It also considers the optimal play by both you and Nene, ensuring that the result is accurate for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
