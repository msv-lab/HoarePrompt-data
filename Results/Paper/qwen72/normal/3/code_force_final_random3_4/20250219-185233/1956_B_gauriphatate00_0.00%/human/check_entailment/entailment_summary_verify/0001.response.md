### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed equally between you and Nene.
   - You and Nene take turns placing one card on the table, and you score a point if the card you place matches a card already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If you have a pair of cards with the same integer, you can score a point by placing the second card after the first one.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. Therefore, if you place a card that Nene has a matching card for, she will place her matching card immediately to score a point.

3. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` calculates the maximum number of points you can score.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It then counts the number of pairs (`pairs`) in your hand.
   - The function returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score a point for each pair you have, and you can only place `n // 2` cards in your turns.

   **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The `Counter` correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - The `pairs` variable correctly counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - The return value `min(pairs, n // 2)` is correct because:
     - You can only score points for the pairs you have.
     - You can only place `n // 2` cards in your turns, so the maximum number of points you can score is limited by the number of pairs you have or the number of turns you have, whichever is smaller.

4. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input data.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to get the result for the current test case and appends it to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

   **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The function correctly reads the input data and processes it in a loop for each test case.
   - It correctly updates the `idx` to point to the next set of input data for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - It prints the results for all test cases after processing all inputs.

5. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly counts the pairs in your hand and returns the maximum number of points you can score.
   - The logic in `func_2` is also correct. It correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
