Output State: **`func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `n` is the sum of the values of `n` for each iteration. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations. `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration. `a` is a list of `n` integers for the last iteration, starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`.**

Explanation:
- `data` remains the same as it was initially, containing the split input from `sys.stdin`.
- `idx` is updated to the position after all the elements used in the loop. For each iteration, `idx` is incremented by `1 + n`, where `n` is the number of integers read for that iteration. After `t` iterations, `idx` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `n` is the sum of the values of `n` for each iteration.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations for the loop to complete.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration of the loop.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers for the last iteration, starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`.
