### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards.
   - Each card has an integer from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to maximize your score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function takes `n` and a list `a` of integers as input.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) by summing up the counts of integers that appear exactly twice.
   - The function returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`.

   **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in your hand.
   - The return value `min(pairs, n // 2)` is correct because:
     - `pairs` represents the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice.
     - `n // 2` represents the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from `n` cards.
     - Since Nene plays optimally, the best you can do is to match up to `n // 2` pairs, but no more than the number of pairs you have in your hand.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of integers.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

   **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - It correctly prints the results for each test case.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` is correct and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
