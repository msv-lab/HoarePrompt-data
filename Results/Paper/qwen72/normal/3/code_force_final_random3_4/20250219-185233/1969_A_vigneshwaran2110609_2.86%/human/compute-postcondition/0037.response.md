Output: **2**

Explanation:
The print statement `print(2)` simply prints the integer value 2. The initial state provides information about other variables (`n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag`), but these variables are not used in the print statement. Therefore, the output is exactly the value 2, as it is explicitly printed.
