Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `x` is a new input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is a new input integer, and `flag` is either True or unchanged.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` updates the variable `l` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The values of `n`, `x`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged.
