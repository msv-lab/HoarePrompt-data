Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list `cards` of 2n unique strings, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2'-'9', second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). The function does not return any value.**
