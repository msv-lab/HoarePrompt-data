### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case. However, the function itself does not take any parameters, which is a design flaw. The function should take `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as parameters to properly handle each test case.
   - The function reads input directly using `input()`, which is not ideal for a function that should be reusable and testable. It would be better to pass the input as parameters.

2. **Card Processing**:
   - The function correctly separates trump cards and non-trump cards.
   - It attempts to pair non-trump cards of the same suit and prints them in sorted order.
   - If a non-trump card cannot be paired with another card of the same suit, it tries to pair it with a trump card.

3. **Trump Card Handling**:
   - The function correctly pairs remaining trump cards and prints them.
   - If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and exits.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the pairs of cards as required, and if no valid pairs can be formed, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
   - The output format matches the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where there are no trump cards and all cards are of the same suit.
   - It also handles cases where there are more non-trump cards than trump cards, correctly printing "IMPOSSIBLE".

### Correctness:
Despite the design flaw of not passing parameters to `func_1`, the function itself correctly processes the input and produces the expected output based on the problem description. However, for a more robust and testable solution, the function should be modified to accept parameters.

Given the current implementation, the function will work correctly for the provided test cases and problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
