Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, and `card` remain unchanged; `rank` is the rank of the next card in the list, `suit` is the suit of the next card in the list, `answers` has a new element appended which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, separated by a space; `suits[suit]` is `None`.** 

In natural language: The variables `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, and `card` are not changed. The `rank` variable still holds the rank of the next card in the list, and the `suit` variable still holds the suit of the next card in the list. The `answers` list has a new element appended, which is a string created by joining the sorted list of the values in `suits[suit]` and `rank`, with each value having `suit` appended to it, and separated by a space. The value in the dictionary `suits` at the key `suit` is now set to `None`.
