Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining elements that were not used. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit. If `trumps` became empty before all non-`None` values in `suits` were processed, the program returned 'IMPOSSIBLE' and did not complete all iterations.**
