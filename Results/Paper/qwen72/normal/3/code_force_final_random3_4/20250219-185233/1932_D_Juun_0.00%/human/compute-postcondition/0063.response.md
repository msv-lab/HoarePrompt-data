The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `trumps` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `trumps` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining elements that were not used and `trumps` must contain at least one element. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.**
