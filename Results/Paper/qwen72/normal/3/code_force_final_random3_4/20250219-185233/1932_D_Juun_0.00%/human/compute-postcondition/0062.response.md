Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed.
- `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining elements that were not used, and it must contain at least one element.
- `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`. Since `trumps` is sorted and contains at least one element, the first `trumps.pop()` will return the last element of `trumps`.
2. **`trump`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the formatted string. Based on the context, `trump` is likely a string representing the suit of the trump cards (e.g., 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S').
3. **Second `trumps.pop()`**: This method is called again, removing and returning the new last element of `trumps` (which is now the second-to-last element from the original list).

### Output Calculation:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return the highest remaining trump card.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return the second-highest remaining trump card.
- The `trump` variable will be appended to each of these values to form the final string.

### Example:
If `trumps` is initially `[2, 3, 4, 5]` and `trump` is 'S', then:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return `5`.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return `4`.
- The output will be: `5S 4S`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `trumps` and `trump` are not provided, we can generalize the output based on the given information.

Output: **[last element of trumps][trump] [second-to-last element of trumps][trump] (where [last element of trumps] and [second-to-last element of trumps] are the highest and second-highest remaining elements in the `trumps` list, and [trump] is the suit of the trump cards)**
