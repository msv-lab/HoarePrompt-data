Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. This is a good structure for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Trump Suit Identification**: The program correctly identifies trump cards by checking if the suit of a card matches the trump suit. Trump cards are stored in a separate list `trumps`.

3. **Pairing Non-Trump Cards**: The program attempts to pair non-trump cards of the same suit. It sorts the ranks of the cards and prints the pair with the lower rank card first and the higher rank card second. This is a valid approach for non-trump cards, as a higher rank card can beat a lower rank card of the same suit.

4. **Handling Remaining Trump Cards**: The program correctly handles the case where there are remaining trump cards. It pairs the trump cards among themselves and prints these pairs. This is valid because a higher rank trump card can beat a lower rank trump card.

5. **IMPOSSIBLE Case**: The program prints "IMPOSSIBLE" if it runs out of trump cards before all non-trump pairs are processed. This is a correct approach because if there are non-trump cards left without a corresponding trump card to beat them, it is impossible to reconstruct the rounds.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no non-trump cards to pair and only trump cards, or when there are no trump cards at all. In these cases, it correctly prints the pairs or "IMPOSSIBLE" as needed.

7. **Multiple Solutions**: The problem statement allows for multiple solutions, and the program prints any valid sequence of pairs. This is consistent with the problem requirements.

8. **Output Format**: The program prints the pairs in the required format, with each pair on a new line and the cards separated by a space.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
