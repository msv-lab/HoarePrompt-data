Postcondition: ***`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one more value is not `None` (excluding the one already processed), `trumps` is a list that is one element shorter, `answers` is updated with a new string in the format `'rank suit trumpSuit trumpRank'`. If `rank` is `None`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.***
