### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one. The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which is a good approach to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Trump Suit Identification**: The program correctly identifies the trump suit and separates the trump cards from the non-trump cards. This is done by checking if the suit of each card matches the trump suit and appending the rank to the `trumps` list if it does.

3. **Non-Trump Card Matching**: The program uses a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the non-trump cards. It attempts to match each non-trump card with another non-trump card of the same suit, ensuring that the second card has a higher rank. If a match is found, it appends the pair to the `answers` list and removes the suit from the dictionary.

4. **Handling Remaining Non-Trump Cards**: If there are any non-trump cards left in the `suits` dictionary after processing all cards, the program attempts to match them with a trump card. If a trump card is available, it appends the pair to the `answers` list. If no trump card is available, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns, which is the correct behavior.

5. **Handling Remaining Trump Cards**: After processing all non-trump cards, the program sorts the remaining trump cards and prints pairs of them, ensuring that the first card in each pair has a higher rank than the second. This is done using a while loop that pops the highest and lowest rank trump cards and prints them as pairs.

6. **Output**: The program prints the pairs of cards in the correct format and handles the "IMPOSSIBLE" case appropriately.

### Issues:
- **Rank Comparison**: The program uses the `sorted` function to compare ranks, which is correct because the ranks are single characters and can be compared lexicographically.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases where there are no non-trump cards left to match with trump cards and where there are no trump cards available to match with non-trump cards.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described, including the edge cases and the required output format. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
