Postcondition: ***`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` is an empty list, `card` is the first element of the list resulting from `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`, `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` contains a single string which is the concatenation of the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list and the value for the key `suit` in `suits` is set to `rank`.***
