Postcondition: ***`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not `None`. If `rank` was `None` in the current iteration, `suit` and `rank` are set to the next key-value pair in `suits` regardless of the value of `rank`, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `rank` was not `None`, `suit` and `rank` are set to the next key-value pair in `suits` where `rank` is not `None`.***
