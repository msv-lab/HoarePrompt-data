Postcondition: ***`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, and `card` remain unchanged; `rank` is the rank of the next card in the list, `suit` is the suit of the next card in the list. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` has a new element appended which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, separated by a space, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.***
