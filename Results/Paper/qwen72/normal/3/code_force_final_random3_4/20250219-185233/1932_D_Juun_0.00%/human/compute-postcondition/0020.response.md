Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trumps`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged; `answers` has a new element appended, which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, followed by `suit`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the `answers` list.
- The new element is a string created by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, and then appending `suit` to the end.
- The values of `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trumps`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged.
