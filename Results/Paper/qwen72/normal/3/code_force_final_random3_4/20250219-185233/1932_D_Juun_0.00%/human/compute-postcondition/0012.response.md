Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` contains a single string which is the concatenation of the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `card` is the first element of the list resulting from `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`, `suit` is not equal to `trump`.**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = None` sets the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`, which means that the dictionary `suits` now has all values set to `None`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
