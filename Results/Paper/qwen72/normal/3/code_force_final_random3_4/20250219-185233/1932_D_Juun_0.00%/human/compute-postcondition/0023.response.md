Postcondition: ***`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trumps`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` has a new element appended, which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of the previous `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, followed by `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is now `None`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`.***
