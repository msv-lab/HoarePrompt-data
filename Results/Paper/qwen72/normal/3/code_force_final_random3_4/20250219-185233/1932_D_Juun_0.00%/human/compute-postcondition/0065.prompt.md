Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining elements that were not used. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit. If `trumps` became empty before all non-`None` values in `suits` were processed, the program returned 'IMPOSSIBLE' and did not complete all iterations.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining elements that were not used and `trumps` must not be empty. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining elements that were not used and `trumps` must contain at least one element. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining elements that were not used and `trumps` must contain at least one element. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
