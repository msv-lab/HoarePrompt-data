The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and an integer `y` (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The program returns a list `results`, where each element in `results` corresponds to a tuple in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` represents the total number of pairs of elements in the corresponding list `arr` that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs in the corresponding list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.**
