### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (i.e., `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`).
   - This part is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where:
     - `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.
   - This part is also correct and sets up the necessary data structures.

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program iterates through each number `num` in the array `arr`.
   - For each `num`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to the `count` variable.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair of residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is correct because it ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if `a_i % x` and `a_j % x` are the same.
   - The calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is correct because it ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if `a_i % y` and `a_j % y` are the same.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and both conditions are satisfied by using the `residue_map`.
   - The key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` is used to track the number of elements that have the same residues, which helps in counting the pairs efficiently.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with the residue calculation for `r_x`. The expression `-num % x` does not always yield the correct residue. For example, if `num = 1` and `x = 5`, `-1 % 5` should be `4` (since `1 + 4 = 5` is divisible by `5`), but `-1 % 5` in Python yields `4` directly, which is correct. However, for negative numbers, this might not always be the case. To ensure correctness, we should use `x - (num % x) % x` instead of `-num % x`.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a dictionary to store the residues, which allows for efficient lookups and updates.
   - The time complexity for each test case is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array, making the overall complexity \(O(t \cdot n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. However, the residue calculation for `r_x` should be adjusted to handle negative numbers correctly. Despite this, the program works correctly for the given problem constraints and examples.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct. The suggested adjustment for `r_x` is a minor improvement but does not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem constraints.
