Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least three elements, `count` is 1 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0), `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the key `current_key` with a value of 2, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple (`-num % x`, `num % y`).**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- `r_x` is `-num % x`, and `r_y` is `num % y`.
- `current_key` is a tuple (`-num % x`, `num % y`).
- The value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` is either 2 if the key `current_key` exists in `residue_map`, or 0 if it does not.
- Therefore, `count` is updated to `1 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
