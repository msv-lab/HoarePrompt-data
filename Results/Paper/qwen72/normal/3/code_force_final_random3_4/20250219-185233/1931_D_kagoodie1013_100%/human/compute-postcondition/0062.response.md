The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `count` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements, `count` is 1, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` and the value 2, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `(num % x, num % y)`.**
