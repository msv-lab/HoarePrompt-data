Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`. `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements. `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have appeared more than once in the list `arr`, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`. `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` and the value is the count of how many times this tuple has appeared in the list `arr`. `results` is a list that now includes the value of `count` as its last element.**
