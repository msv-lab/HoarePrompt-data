Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least 2 elements, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` and the value `1`, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable to be a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.
- The values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are used to compute the new `current_key`.
- The initial state already specifies that `num` is the second element of `arr`, `x` and `y` are integers within the given ranges, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers.
- The `residue_map` dictionary still has the key `current_key` with the value `1`.
- The `count` variable is still the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
