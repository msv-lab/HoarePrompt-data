You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))

        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs of elements in the corresponding `arr` list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (i.e., `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`).

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where:
     - `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program iterates through each number `num` in the array `arr`.
   - For each `num`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to the `count` variable.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair of residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Residue Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is correct because it ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if `a_i % x` and `a_j % x` are the same.
  - The calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is correct because it ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if `a_i % y` and `a_j % y` are the same.

- **Counting Pairs:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and both conditions are satisfied by using the `residue_map`.
  - The key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` is used to track the number of elements that have the same residues, which helps in counting the pairs efficiently.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses a dictionary to store the residues, which allows for efficient lookups and updates.
  - The time complexity for each test case is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array, making the overall complexity \(O(t \cdot n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. It correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
