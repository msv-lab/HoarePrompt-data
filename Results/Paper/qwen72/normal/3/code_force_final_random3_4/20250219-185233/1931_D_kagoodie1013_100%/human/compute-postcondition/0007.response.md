The code snippet `count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` updates the value of `count` based on the value of `r_x` and `r_y` from the initial state. The `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, so the `get` method will return `0` for the key `(r_x, r_y)` if it does not exist in the dictionary. Therefore, `count` will be incremented by `0`, which means `count` remains `0`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least one element, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**
