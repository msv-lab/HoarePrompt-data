Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least 1 element, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- Since `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, the key `(r_x, r_y)` does not exist, and `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` returns `0`.
- Therefore, `count` remains `0` after the execution of the code.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
