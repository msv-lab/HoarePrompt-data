Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2 or 3, `same` is 2 or 3, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar`. Additionally, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1.**
