Postcondition: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was initially equal to infinity, `minn` remains infinity. Otherwise, `minn` is not equal to infinity.**
