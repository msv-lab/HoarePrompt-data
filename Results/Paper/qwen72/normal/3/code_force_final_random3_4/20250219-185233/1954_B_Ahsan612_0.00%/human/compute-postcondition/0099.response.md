Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least four elements, `i` is 4, if `ar[1]` is equal to `num` (which is the first element of `ar`), `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the third element of `ar`, and `minn` is 1, with the condition that the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**
