Output State: **_ is incremented by the number of iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar`, and `same` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`.**

### Explanation:
- **_**: This variable is incremented by the number of iterations the loop goes through.
- **t**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **n**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **ar**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **i**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
- **num**: After the loop finishes, `num` will be the last element of `ar` because the loop updates `num` to the current element whenever it encounters a different number.
- **minn**: This variable will hold the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar`. The loop updates `minn` whenever it encounters a different number, ensuring that `minn` captures the smallest sequence length.
- **same**: This variable will hold the length of the last sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`. If the last element is part of a sequence, `same` will be the length of that sequence. If the last element is different from the previous one, `same` will be 1.
