Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, the program's logic is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Consecutive Sequences**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same number (`minn`). However, this approach does not correctly handle the problem's requirement. The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful, which means we need to prevent the operation `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` from being possible for any `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1).

2. **Handling of Consecutive Sequences**:
   - The program increments `i` by 1 when it encounters a different number, and then sets `num` to `ar[i]` without checking the next element. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the array has more than one type of consecutive sequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the array is already not beautiful or where the array consists of all identical elements. For example, in the case where the array is `[2, 2, 2]`, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. However, the program's logic does not account for this.

4. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `minn` as the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same number. This is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. Instead, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) exists where `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}`.

5. **Output for All-Identical Arrays**:
   - The program should output `-1` for arrays where all elements are the same, but it does not handle this case correctly. For example, for the input `[2, 2, 2]`, the program should output `-1`, but it will output `3` instead.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
