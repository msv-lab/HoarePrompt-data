Output State: **_ is incremented by the number of iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar` and `same`, and `same` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.
- Since `minn` was initially the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar`, and `same` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`, the new value of `minn` will be the minimum of these two values.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`) remain unchanged.
