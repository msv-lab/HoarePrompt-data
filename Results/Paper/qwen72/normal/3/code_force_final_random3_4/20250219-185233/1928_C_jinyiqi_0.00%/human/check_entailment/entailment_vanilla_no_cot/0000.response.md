Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the divisors of `x`, but it incorrectly reverses the list `output1` and concatenates it with `output2`. This results in a list of divisors that is not in the correct order and may contain duplicates.
   - The function should return a list of divisors in ascending order without duplicates.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic for determining the valid `k` values is flawed. The conditions for appending `k` values to the `output` list are not correctly formulated.
   - The program should consider the periodic nature of the sequence and correctly identify the valid `k` values based on the position `n` and the number `x` received.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = set()
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        if (n - 1) % period < k:
            if (n - 1) % period + 1 == x:
                valid_ks.add(k)
        else:
            if period - (n - 1) % period + 1 == x:
                valid_ks.add(k)
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Function `count_valid_ks`**:
   - This function iterates over possible values of `k` from 2 to `n`.
   - For each `k`, it calculates the period of the sequence, which is `2 * k - 2`.
   - It then checks if Vasya's position `n` falls within the first half or the second half of the period.
   - If `n` falls within the first half, it checks if the number received is `x`.
   - If `n` falls within the second half, it checks if the number received is `x` by considering the reverse sequence.
   - It adds valid `k` values to a set to avoid duplicates.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the `count_valid_ks` function.
   - It prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case based on the given problem description.
