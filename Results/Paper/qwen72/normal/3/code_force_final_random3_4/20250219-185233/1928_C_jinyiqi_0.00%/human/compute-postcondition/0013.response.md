Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing [1, 2, 3, 3], and `output2` is a list containing [x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3), int(x / 3)] if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `output1` remains [1, 2, 3, 3] and `output2` remains [x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3)].**

Explanation: The code appends the value `int(x / i)` to the list `output2`. Since `i` is 3, the value `int(x / 3)` is appended to `output2`. If `x` is divisible by 3, the new value `int(x / 3)` is the same as `x / 3`, and it is appended to `output2`. If `x` is not divisible by 3, the value `int(x / 3)` is still appended, but it will be the integer part of `x / 3`. The other variables and lists remain unchanged.
