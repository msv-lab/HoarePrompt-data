Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` is a list containing [1, 2, 3, 3], and `output2` is a list containing [x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3), int(x / 3)]. Otherwise, `output1` remains [1, 2, 3] and `output2` remains [x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3)].***
