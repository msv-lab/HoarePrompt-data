Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements of `v` are integers provided by the user.
   - `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is very straightforward: it prints the integer `2`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables and the list `v`, but none of this information affects the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or the list `v`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
