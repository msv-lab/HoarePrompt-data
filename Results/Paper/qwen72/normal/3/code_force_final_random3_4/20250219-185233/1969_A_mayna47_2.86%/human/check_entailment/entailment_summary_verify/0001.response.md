### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - It initializes `v` as a list of size `n + 1` to handle 1-indexed input.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 2` by printing `2`. This is because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates through each friend from 1 to `n` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if there is a cycle of length 3.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints `2` and returns, which is correct because inviting 2 friends from this cycle will ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints `3`.

### Analysis:
- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is used to detect cycles of length 3. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to cover all cases where at least 2 friends can be invited.
  - For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 2 (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`), then inviting just 2 friends from this cycle will ensure both attend the party. The program does not check for cycles of length 2.
  - Additionally, the program does not consider other configurations where fewer than 3 friends can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 2` by printing `2`.
  - For `n > 2`, the program only checks for cycles of length 3 and prints `3` if no such cycle is found. This is incorrect because there could be cycles of length 2 or other configurations that allow inviting fewer than 3 friends.

### Example Analysis:
- **First Test Case**:
  - `n = 5`, `v = [0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - The program correctly identifies the cycle of length 3 (3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3) and prints `2`.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `n = 4`, `v = [0, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - The program does not identify any cycle of length 3 and prints `3`.
  - However, there is a cycle of length 4 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), and the minimum number of invitations required is 2 (inviting 1 and 2, for example).

- **Third Test Case**:
  - `n = 2`, `v = [0, 2, 1]`
  - The program correctly handles this case by printing `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks for cycles of length 3 and does not handle cycles of length 2 or other configurations that might allow inviting fewer than 3 friends. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
