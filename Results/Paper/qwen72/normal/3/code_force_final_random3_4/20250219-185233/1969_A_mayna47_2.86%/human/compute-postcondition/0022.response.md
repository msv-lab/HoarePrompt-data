Functionality: **The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters: `t`, an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of integers (1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, all p_i are distinct). However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, and the function returns nothing in all cases.**
