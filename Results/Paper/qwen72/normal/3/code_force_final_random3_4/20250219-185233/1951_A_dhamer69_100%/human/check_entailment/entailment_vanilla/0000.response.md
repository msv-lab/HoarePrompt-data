### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` starts by reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, each time reading an integer `n` and a string `s`.

2. **Test Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If `n == 2`, the function checks if the string `s` is '00'. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct because if `n == 2`, the only valid string is '00' (since '01', '10', and '11' would not satisfy the conditions).

3. **General Case for `n > 2`**:
   - The function counts the number of '1's in the string `s` and stores it in `count_1`.
   - It then checks if `count_1` is odd. If it is, it prints 'NO' because the string cannot be divided into two equal parts with the same number of '1's.
   - If `count_1` is even, it further checks if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' and `count_1` is exactly 2. If both conditions are true, it prints 'NO' because the string cannot be divided into two equal parts with the same number of '1's.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are logically consistent with the problem description.
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
