The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. The function then checks the string `s` based on the value of `n` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, if `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' if `s` is '00', otherwise 'NO'. If `n` is not 2, it prints 'NO' if the number of '1' characters in `s` is odd or if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no further actions or side effects.
