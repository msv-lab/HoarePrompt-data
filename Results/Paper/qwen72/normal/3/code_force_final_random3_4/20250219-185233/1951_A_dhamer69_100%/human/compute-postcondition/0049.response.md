Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 2` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the program executes the if part. If `n` != 2 and `count_1` (the number of '1' characters in `s`) is odd, or if `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, the program also executes the if part. In all other cases, the program executes the else part, but the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
