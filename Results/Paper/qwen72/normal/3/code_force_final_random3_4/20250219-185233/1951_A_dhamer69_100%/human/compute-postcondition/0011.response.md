The code snippet `count_1 = s.count('1')` calculates the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `count_1`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`.**
