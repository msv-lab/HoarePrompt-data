The given `print` statement is:
```
print('YES')
```
This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{start} \leq \text{end}\).
- `t` is defined as `t - 2` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string.

None of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement, which is a simple constant string.

Output: **YES**
