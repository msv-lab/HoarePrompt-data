The variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 but now `t` is `t - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 but now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string.**
