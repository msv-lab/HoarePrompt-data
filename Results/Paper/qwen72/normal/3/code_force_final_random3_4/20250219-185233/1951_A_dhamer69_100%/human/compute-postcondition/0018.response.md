Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`.
2. `t` must be greater than 0.
3. `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2.
4. `s` is an input string.
5. `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, and `count_1` is even.
6. Additionally, either `s` does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11' or `count_1` is not equal to 2.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' because the conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly. The conditions are constraints on the input values but do not change the content of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
