Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is 3, `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `sum` is `n + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**

Explanation:
- `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3.
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 0 and 498.
- The value of `n` remains at least 2.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `j` is now `n + 3` (since `r` is now 3).
- The value of `sum` is updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If this condition is true, `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n`. If the condition is false, `sum` is updated to `n + 2 * n`.
