Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 2`, `r` is 2, and `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n` is no longer relevant after the execution of the code snippet. The new value of `sum` is simply the old value of `sum` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
