To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 499.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` is true.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` is false.

2. **Analyzing the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.
   - The first argument is the integer 2.
   - The second argument is `j % n`, which is the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.

3. **Determining the value of `j % n`:**
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - The remainder of 3 divided by `n` depends on the value of `n`:
     - If `n` is 1, then `j % n` is `3 % 1` which is 0.
     - If `n` is 2, then `j % n` is `3 % 2` which is 1.
     - If `n` is 3 or greater, then `j % n` is `3 % n` which is 3 (since 3 is less than `n`).

4. **Combining the results:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer 2 followed by the value of `j % n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the possible values for `j % n` are 0, 1, or 3 depending on the value of `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be `2` followed by the value of `j % n`.

Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is 0 if n is 1, 1 if n is 2, and 3 if n is 3 or greater)**
