Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is 1, `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`, and the current value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated by adding the result of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `r`) and the condition that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` remain unchanged.
