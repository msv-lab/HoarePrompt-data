The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `n`, and `r`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `j <= n + r`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 499.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 2.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` is true.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` is false.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `j <= n + r` must still be true. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is 3.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` is true. If `j` is greater than `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` is false.**
