Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is 0, `sum` is `n`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` adds the value of `i * n` to the current value of `sum`. Initially, `sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `sum` becomes `1 * n`, which is `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n` still holds true.
