Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `n + i * n` and `r` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `i * n` is `2 * n`.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` was initially `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and after the code execution, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n`.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` was initially `n`, and after the code execution, `sum` becomes `n + 2 * n`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.
