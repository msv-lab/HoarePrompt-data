Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer between 0 and 499, as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop iterates from `1` to `n`.
- **`j`**: Remains `n + 1`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: `r` will be the largest integer `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true. If the condition is never true, `r` will remain `0`.
- **`sum`**: The value of `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all iterations where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the sum of `i * n` for all iterations where the condition is false. This means that `sum` will be the total of the values added to it during each iteration of the loop.
