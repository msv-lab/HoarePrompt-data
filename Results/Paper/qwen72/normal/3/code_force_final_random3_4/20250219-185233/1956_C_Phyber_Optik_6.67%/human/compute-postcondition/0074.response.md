The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `n`, and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n + r + 1`. If `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue is `j <= n + r`, so `n + r` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false. If `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` is true. If `j` is greater than `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` is false.**
