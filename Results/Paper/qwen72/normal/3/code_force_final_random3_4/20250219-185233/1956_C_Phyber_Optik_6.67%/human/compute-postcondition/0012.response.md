Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `r` is 2, `sum` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition for `sum` and `r` is still valid, but `r` is now specifically 2.
