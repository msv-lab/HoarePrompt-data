Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, which can be achieved by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values using the allowed operations. The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element can be at most \( n \), is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \). However, the program seems to be using a different logic to calculate the sum and the number of operations, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Here is a more appropriate approach to solve the problem:

1. For an \( n \times n \) matrix, the maximum sum is \( n^3 \).
2. To achieve this, we can perform \( n \) operations of Type 1 and \( n \) operations of Type 2, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

This ensures that each element in the matrix is set to \( n \), thus maximizing the sum.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n
        num_operations = 2 * n
        print(max_sum, num_operations)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations, and it prints the operations in the required format. Each operation uses the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), ensuring that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.
