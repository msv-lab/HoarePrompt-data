Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`).
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n + r + 1` must be greater than 3.

2. **Understanding `r`:**
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > i \cdot n
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by `n`:
     \[
     \frac{n + 1}{2} > i
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     i < \frac{n + 1}{2}
     \]
   - The largest `i` that satisfies this condition is:
     \[
     i = \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1
     \]
   - However, if `n` is 1, the condition `i < 1` is not satisfied for any `i` from 1 to `n`, so `r` will be `n`.

3. **Understanding `j % n`:**
   - `j` is set to 3.
   - `j % n` will be the remainder when 3 is divided by `n`.
   - If `n` is 1, `j % n` will be 0.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, `j % n` will be 3 (since 3 divided by any integer greater than 1 leaves a remainder of 3).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is:
     \[
     \text{print(2, j \% n, end=' ')}
     \]
   - This will print the integer 2, followed by the value of `j % n`, and end with a space.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since `j` is 3, `j % n` will be 3 if `n` is greater than 1, and 0 if `n` is 1.
   - Therefore, the output will be:
     - If `n` is 1: `2 0 `
     - If `n` is greater than 1: `2 3 `

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and the condition `n + r + 1 > 3` must hold, `n` cannot be 1 (since `r` would be 1, and `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which does not satisfy the condition). Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

Output: **2 3**
