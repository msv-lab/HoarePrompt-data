Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `r` is `n`, and `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n. Additionally, `j` is greater than `n`.***
