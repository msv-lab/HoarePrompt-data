The value of `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `r`) remain unchanged. 

Given the initial conditions:
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` was initially `n`.
- Otherwise, `sum` was initially `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

In both cases, `sum` is now increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `r` is 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` more than its initial value.**

If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` is now `n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.

If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is now `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `2 * n * (n + 1) // 2` or `n * (n + 1)`.
