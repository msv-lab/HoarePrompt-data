Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 499.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.
   - Additionally, `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the integer `2`, followed by the result of `j % n`, and then a space.
   - `j` is stated to be greater than `n`. Since `j` is 1 initially, this condition implies that `j` must have been updated to a value greater than `n` before the print statement is executed.
   - The modulo operation `j % n` will yield the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Since `j` is greater than `n`, `j % n` will be a value between 1 and `n-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The integer `2` is printed first.
   - The value of `j % n` is printed next. Given that `j` is greater than `n`, the exact value of `j % n` depends on the specific values of `j` and `n`, but it will always be a positive integer less than `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, [j % n] (where [j % n] is the remainder when j is divided by n, and j is greater than n)**
