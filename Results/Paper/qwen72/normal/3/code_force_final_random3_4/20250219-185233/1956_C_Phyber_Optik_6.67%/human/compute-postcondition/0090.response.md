The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` in the loop head is the loop iterator, which starts at 1 and goes up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is `n + r`
- `r` is 0
- `sum` is 0

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` should start at 1, which is the initial value of the loop iterator.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is 0, `sum` is 0**
