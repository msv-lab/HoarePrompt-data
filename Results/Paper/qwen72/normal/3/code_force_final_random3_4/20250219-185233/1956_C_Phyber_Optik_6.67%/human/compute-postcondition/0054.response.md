To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 499.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is `n` and `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- Otherwise, `r` is 0 and `sum` is `n * n`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This means `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. However, since `i` is already `n`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
4. **Loop Termination**: The loop will terminate if `i` is greater than `n`. Since `i` will be `n + 1` in the next iteration, the loop will not execute again.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is `n + 1`.
- The loop will not execute again because `i` is now greater than `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is 0, and `sum` is `n * n`**. 

Note: Since the loop will not execute again, the values of `r` and `sum` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
