Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 3. Otherwise, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` is `n + i * n` and `r` is 0. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false but `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` is also false, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` and `r` is 1.***
