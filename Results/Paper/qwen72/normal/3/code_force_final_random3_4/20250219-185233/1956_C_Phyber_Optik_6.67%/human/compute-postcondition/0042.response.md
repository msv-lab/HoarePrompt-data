Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`), `j` is 3, and `n + r + 1` must be greater than 3.*** 

Since both the if and else parts result in the same postconditions, the overall postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the value of `j`.
