Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 499.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` is true.
   - If `j` is greater than `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` is false.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output the integer `2` followed by the result of `j % n`.
   - `j` is given as 2.
   - `n` is greater than 0, so `j % n` will be `2 % n`.

4. **Possible Values for `j % n`:**
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the possible values for `2 % n` are:
     - If `n` is 1, `2 % 1` is 0.
     - If `n` is 2, `2 % 2` is 0.
     - If `n` is greater than 2, `2 % n` is 2.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will always output `2` followed by the result of `2 % n`.
   - If `n` is 1 or 2, the output will be `2 0`.
   - If `n` is greater than 2, the output will be `2 2`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the possible values of `2 % n`.

Output: **2 [2 % n] (where [2 % n] is 0 if n is 1 or 2, and 2 if n is greater than 2)**
