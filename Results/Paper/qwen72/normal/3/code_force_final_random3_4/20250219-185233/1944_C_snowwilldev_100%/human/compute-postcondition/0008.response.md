Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains the key `a[0]` with a value of 1, the key `a[1]` with a value of `cnt[a[1]] + 1`, and the key `a[2]` with a value of `cnt[a[2]] + 1`, `i` is 2, `N` must be greater than 2.**
