Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a`. For example:

```python
test_cases = [(4, [0, 0, 1, 1]), (4, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (2, [1, 1])]
```

This would allow the function to process multiple test cases as described in the problem.
