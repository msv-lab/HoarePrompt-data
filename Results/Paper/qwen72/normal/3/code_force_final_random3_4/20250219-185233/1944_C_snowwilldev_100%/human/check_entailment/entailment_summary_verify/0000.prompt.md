You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers `a` of size `N`, where each integer `a_i` is in the range (0 ≤ a_i < N). The function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` and returns the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once in the list or is missing from the list, provided that no more than one other integer has appeared exactly once before `i`. If no such integer is found, the function returns `N`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal moves for both players. The current logic in `func_1` simply counts the occurrences of each number and returns the smallest number that either does not appear or appears only once when two such numbers are found. This approach does not simulate the game as described, where Alice and Bob take turns and Alice aims to maximize the MEX while Bob aims to minimize it.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```
- **Expected Output:** 3
- **Actual Output:** 0

**Explanation:**
- Alice can start by picking 2, resulting in `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
- Bob can then pick 0, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
- Alice can pick 1, resulting in `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
- Bob can pick 2, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is 3, which is the optimal score Alice can achieve. However, the program returns 0, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both players, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
