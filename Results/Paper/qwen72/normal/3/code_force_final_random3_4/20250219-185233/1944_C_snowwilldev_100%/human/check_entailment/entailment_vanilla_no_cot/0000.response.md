Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem by determining the optimal MEX score for the game where Alice and Bob play optimally. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. This is done correctly using a loop.

2. **Counting Elements**: For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`. It then uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` by ensuring that the smallest non-negative integers are included in `c` as much as possible.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c` by removing elements that Alice would otherwise include.

4. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each integer in the array `a`.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it increments a counter `t` to track how many such integers have been seen.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if an integer `i` does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), it returns `i` as the MEX. This is because if two different integers appear exactly once, Alice and Bob will both pick one of them, and the next smallest integer that does not appear will be the MEX.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all integers from 0 to `N-1` are present in `a` by returning `N` as the MEX.
   - It also handles the case where some integers are missing by returning the smallest missing integer.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program's logic and implementation are correct and should produce the correct MEX for each test case.
