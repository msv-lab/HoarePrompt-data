The function `func_1` is intended to accept three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`, and an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, and the output cases do not align with the expected functionality based on the parameters described. Given the output cases, the function `func_1` does not seem to use the parameters to determine its output. Instead, it returns one of three integers (0, 1, or 2) based on some internal logic that is not provided.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` returns an integer. Depending on some internal logic, it can return 0, 1, or 2.**
