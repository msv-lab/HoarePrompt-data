Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is 1 or 2, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains each unique integer `a_i` from the list `a` as keys with their respective values being the count of how many times each integer appears in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `N` is the size of the list `a` and `N` must be greater than 0, `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not 0.**
