The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of the key `a[i]` in the `defaultdict` `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the key `a[1]` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with a default value type of `int`, if `a[1]` is not already a key in `cnt`, it will be initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1. If `a[1]` is already a key, its value will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains the key `a[0]` with a value of 1 and the key `a[1]` with a value of `cnt[a[1]] + 1`, `i` is 1, `N` must be greater than 1.**
