Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `M` is a list. If `w` is an integer and `w` >= `x - 1`, then `M` contains the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. `w` is the square root of `q`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), and if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1 and `q // i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), `M` is a list that includes the value 1. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also includes the value `q // i`. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is less than `x - 1`, or if `q` is not divisible by `i`, `M` remains a list that includes the values 1 and 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 3. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then `M` is a list that includes the value 1. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also includes the value `q // i`. If `q // i` is less than `x - 1`, or if `q` is not divisible by `i`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1 and 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
