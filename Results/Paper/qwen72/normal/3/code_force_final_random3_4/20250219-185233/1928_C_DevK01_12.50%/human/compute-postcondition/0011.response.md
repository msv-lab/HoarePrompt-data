Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1 and `q // i`. The current value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`.
- Since `i` is 1, `q // i` is equal to `q`.
- Therefore, `M` now includes the value 1 and the value `q`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
