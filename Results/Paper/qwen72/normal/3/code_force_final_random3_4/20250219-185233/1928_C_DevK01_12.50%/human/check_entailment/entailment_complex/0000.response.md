### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` representing Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is odd.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, it is impossible for `n` and `x` to fit the pattern of settling, as the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, which is always even.

3. **Function `func_1` Call:**
   - If `y` is even, the program calls `func_1` with arguments `((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - This function is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `M`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from `1` to `int(w) - 1` (where `w` is the square root of `q`), checking if they are divisors of `q`.
   - For each divisor `i` that is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `i` to the list `M`.
   - It also adds the corresponding quotient `q // i` to the list `M` if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

5. **Combining Results:**
   - After calling `func_1` with `((y - 2) // 2, x)`, the program checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`.
   - If this condition is true, it calls `func_1` again with `((n - x) // 2, x)` and appends the results to the list `L1`.
   - The program then converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set, which represents the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

### Correctness:

- **Initial Check (`y % 2 != 0`):**
  - This check is correct because the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, which is always even. If `y` is odd, no valid `k` can exist.

- **Function `func_1` Logic:**
  - The function correctly finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients.
  - The use of the square root to limit the range of the loop is efficient and correct.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program correctly combines the results from the two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.
  - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` ensures that the second call to `func_1` is only made when it is necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
