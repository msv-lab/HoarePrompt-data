To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `q` is an integer greater than 1.
- `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), and if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1 and `q // i`.
- If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value 1.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i` and `w`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `i < int(w // 1)` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

4. **Check the Condition:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - The loop will execute again if `2 < int(w // 1)`.
   - Since `w` is the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than 1, `int(w // 1)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `w` must be such that `int(w // 1)` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), and if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1 and `q // i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value 1.**
