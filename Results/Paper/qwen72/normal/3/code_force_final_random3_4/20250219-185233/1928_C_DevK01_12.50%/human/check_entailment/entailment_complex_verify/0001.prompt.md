You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    #The program returns a list `M` that contains all divisors of `q` (an integer greater than 1) that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients `q // i` that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients `q // i` that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `q` is a perfect square and its square root is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the square root is included in the list. The list `M` may be empty if no such divisors or quotients exist.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem describes a pattern where the numbers assigned to students in a line repeat every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The pattern is: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, \ldots\).
   - Vasya's position \(n\) and the number he received \(x\) are given.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \(k\) (where \(k > 1\)) fit the given constraints.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - For a given \(n\) and \(x\), \(k\) must satisfy the condition that the number at position \(n\) in the pattern is \(x\).

3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The position \(n\) can be expressed as \(n = m \cdot (2k - 2) + p\), where \(m\) is the number of complete cycles and \(p\) is the position within the current cycle.
   - The number at position \(p\) in the cycle must be \(x\).
   - The cycle has two parts: the first \(k\) positions are \(1, 2, \ldots, k\) and the next \(k-2\) positions are \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\).
   - Therefore, \(p\) can be either in the first part or the second part of the cycle.

4. **Conditions for \(p\)**:
   - If \(p \leq k\), then \(p = x\).
   - If \(p > k\), then \(p = 2k - p\), which simplifies to \(p = 2k - x\).

5. **Solving for \(k\)**:
   - We need to find all \(k\) such that \(n = m \cdot (2k - 2) + p\) and \(p\) is either \(x\) or \(2k - x\).
   - This can be rewritten as \(n + x = m \cdot (2k - 2) + 2x\) or \(n + x = m \cdot (2k - 2) + 2k\).

6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because \(y\) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calls `func_1` to find all divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It then checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and adds the results of `func_1` for \((n - x) // 2\) to the list of divisors.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates and prints the length of the list.

7. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It checks if \(q\) is a perfect square and if the square root is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \(\sqrt{q}\) and adds divisors that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).

8. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(y\) is odd.
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) and \((n - x) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - The program correctly removes duplicates and counts the number of valid \(k\).

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
