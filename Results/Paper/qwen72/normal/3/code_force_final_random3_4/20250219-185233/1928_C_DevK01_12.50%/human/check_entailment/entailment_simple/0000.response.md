### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem describes a pattern of assigning numbers to positions in a line, where the pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - Given Vasya's position \(n\) and the number \(x\) he received, we need to determine how many different \(k\) values fit the constraints.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers.
   - For a given \(k\), the sequence is:
     - \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\)
     - \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\)
     - \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\)
     - And so on.
   - The sequence repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - If Vasya's position \(n\) and the number \(x\) he received are given, we can determine the possible \(k\) values by considering the position modulo \(2k - 2\).
   - Specifically, if \(n\) is in the increasing part of the sequence, \(n \mod (2k - 2)\) should be \(x\).
   - If \(n\) is in the decreasing part of the sequence, \(n \mod (2k - 2)\) should be \(2k - 1 - x\).

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is because \(y\) being odd implies that \(n + x\) is not divisible by 2, which is a necessary condition for the pattern to fit.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calculates \(q = (y - 2) // 2\) and calls `func_1(q, x)`.
   - It then checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and if so, calls `func_1` again with \(q = (n - x) // 2\).
   - The results from `func_1` are combined, and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - Finally, the length of the set is printed, which represents the number of valid \(k\) values.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` takes two parameters \(q\) and \(x\) and returns a list of divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It first calculates the square root of \(q\) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \(x - 1\). If so, it adds it to the list.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \(q\), checking if they are divisors of \(q\) and if they or their corresponding quotients are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - The function returns the list of valid divisors.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(y\) is odd.
   - The calculation of \(q\) and the calls to `func_1` are appropriate for finding the divisors.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates is correct.
   - The logic for checking \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and calling `func_1` again is necessary to cover all possible valid \(k\) values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and the pattern described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
