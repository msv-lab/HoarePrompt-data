To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `w`.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))` will execute if the range from 1 to `int(w // 1)` (exclusive) contains at least one integer. This means `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

2. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `q` and `x` are integers with the condition `1 <= x < q <= 10^9`.
   - `w` is the square root of `q`.
   - If `w` is an integer and `w` >= `x - 1`, then `M` contains the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute, `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 1. This implies that `w` must be greater than 1.
   - Since `w` is the square root of `q`, `q` must be greater than 1 (because the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of any number greater than 1 is greater than 1).

4. **Final State**:
   - `i` must start at 1.
   - `w` must be greater than 1, which means `q` must be greater than 1.
   - The condition `w >= x - 1` must hold true for `M` to contain `w`, but this is not directly relevant to the loop execution itself.

Given these points, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
