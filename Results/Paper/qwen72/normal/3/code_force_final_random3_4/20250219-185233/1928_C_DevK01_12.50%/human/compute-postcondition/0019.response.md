Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), `M` is a list that includes the value 1. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also includes the value `q // i`. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is less than `x - 1`, or if `q` is not divisible by `i`, `M` remains a list that includes the values 1 and 2.***
