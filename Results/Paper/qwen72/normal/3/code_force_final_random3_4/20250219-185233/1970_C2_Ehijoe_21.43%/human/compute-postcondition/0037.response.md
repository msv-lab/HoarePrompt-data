Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` from input, where `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `t = 1`. It then reads `n - 1` pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges in a graph, constructs a bidirectional adjacency list `nodes` from these edges, and identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one connection) in a deque `leaves`. The function reads an integer `start` from input, representing the starting node, and calls another function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` to get a list of moves. If any move in the list is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `nodes` contains the adjacency list of the graph, `leaves` contains all leaf nodes, and `start` is the input starting node. **
