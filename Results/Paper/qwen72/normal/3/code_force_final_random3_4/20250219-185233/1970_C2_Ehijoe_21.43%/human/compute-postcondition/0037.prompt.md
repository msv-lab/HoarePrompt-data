You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and t are integers where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and t = 1. The edges list is initially empty and will be populated with pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n. start is an integer representing the starting node, where 1 <= start <= n.
def func_2():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers that are connected to the key. Each connection is bidirectional, meaning if `u` is connected to `v`, then `u` will be in `nodes[v]` and `v` will be in `nodes[u]`. The `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `empty` is True.
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, and `leaves` is a deque containing all the integers from 1 to `n` that have exactly one connection in `nodes`.
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the integers from 1 to `n` that have exactly one connection in `nodes`, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If at least one element in `moves` is an odd number, the function proceeds accordingly. If all elements in `moves` are even, the function proceeds accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `start`, and returns a list of nodes that can be reached from the `start` node within 1 time unit, including the starting node itself and any directly connected nodes.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
