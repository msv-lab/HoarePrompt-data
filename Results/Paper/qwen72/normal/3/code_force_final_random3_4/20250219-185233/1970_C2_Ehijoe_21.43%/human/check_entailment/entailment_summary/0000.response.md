### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is considered active.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The game is played optimally, and we need to determine the winner for each round.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all its descendant leaf nodes.
   - If the starting node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is its parent), it returns `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances for each child node and increments them by 1 to account for the step from the starting node to the child node.
   - The distances are returned as a list.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner of the game.
   - It reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It reads the edges of the tree and constructs an adjacency list `nodes`.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque `leaves`.
   - It reads the starting node `start` for the round.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to its descendant leaf nodes.
   - It checks if any distance in the list is odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Tree Construction**: The function correctly constructs the tree using the adjacency list.
   - **Leaf Node Identification**: The function correctly identifies leaf nodes, but this information is not used in the game logic.
   - **Distance Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all its descendant leaf nodes.
   - **Winning Condition**: The game is won by the player who can make the last move. If the starting node has any odd-distance leaf node, Ron can always force the game to end on an odd move, ensuring his win. If all distances are even, Hermione will win because she will always be the one to make the last move.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Leaf Node**: If the starting node is a leaf node, the function correctly returns `[0]`, and Hermione wins.
   - **Multiple Leaf Nodes**: The function correctly calculates the distances and determines the winner based on the parity of the distances.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this goal.

**Correctness: True**
