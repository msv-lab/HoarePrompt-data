Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the integers from 1 to `n` that have exactly one connection in `nodes`, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and all elements in `moves` are even.**
