Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the integers from 1 to `n` that have exactly one connection in `nodes`, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`**

Explanation:
- `moves` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `nodes`, `edges`, `start`, `empty`, and `leaves` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `moves` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `nodes` and `start`.
