### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction:**
   - The program correctly parses the input to get the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree using the edges provided in the input. This is done correctly by appending each node to the other's list in the `nodes` dictionary.

2. **Leaf Node Identification:**
   - The program identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection) and stores them in a deque. This is a correct step because leaf nodes are the nodes that have only one neighbor.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. It does this recursively by traversing the tree and extending the `distances` list with the distances from each child node plus one.
   - The base case of the recursion is when a node has only one neighbor, which is its parent. In this case, the function returns a list containing the single element `0`, indicating that the node is a leaf and has no further neighbors to explore.
   - The recursive case correctly extends the `distances` list with the distances from each child node plus one, ensuring that the distances are calculated correctly.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program determines the winner based on the parity of the distances. If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins the round. If all distances are even, Hermione wins the round.
   - This logic is correct because in a tree, if the starting node has an odd distance to any leaf, Ron can always make the first move and force Hermione into a position where she has to make a move from an odd distance, eventually losing the round. Conversely, if all distances are even, Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves and force him into a losing position.

5. **Function Calls and Output:**
   - The program calls `func_2` once, as specified by the problem statement.
   - The output is correctly determined based on the distances calculated by `func_1`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description and the provided input format. The recursive distance calculation and the winning condition check are both implemented correctly.
