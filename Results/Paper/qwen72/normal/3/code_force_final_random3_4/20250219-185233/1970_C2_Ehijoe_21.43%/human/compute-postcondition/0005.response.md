The values of `u` and `v` are assigned the integers obtained from the input, which is split and then converted to integers. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers.
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers.**
