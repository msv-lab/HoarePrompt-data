Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `t` is 1, but now `n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the input. The edges list is still empty, and `start` is an integer where 1 <= `start` <= `n`.**

The code snippet `edges = []` initializes the `edges` list to an empty list. The values of `n`, `t`, and `start` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` and `t` are integers within the specified ranges and `start` is an integer within the specified range still holds true.
