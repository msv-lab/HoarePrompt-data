The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` and `t` are integers with the constraints 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and t = 1. `edges` is a list that will be populated with pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n. `start` is an integer representing the starting node, with the constraint 1 <= start <= n.

The function returns a list of nodes that can be reached from the `start` node within `t` time units, where `t` is always 1. The list includes the starting node itself and any nodes directly connected to it through the edges defined in the `edges` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `start`, and returns a list of nodes that can be reached from the `start` node within 1 time unit, including the starting node itself and any directly connected nodes.**
