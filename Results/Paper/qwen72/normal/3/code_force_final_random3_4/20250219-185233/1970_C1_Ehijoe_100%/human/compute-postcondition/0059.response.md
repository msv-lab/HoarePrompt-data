Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all the nodes from `s` to `e` (inclusive) and now includes `e` as the last element, `prev` is the last node added to `tree` before the loop terminated, `curr` is equal to `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.** 

The code snippet `idx = tree.index(start)` assigns the index of the `start` value within the `tree` list to the variable `idx`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx` is the position of `start` in the `tree` list, starting from 0.
