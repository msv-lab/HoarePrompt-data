Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` is a list that now includes `v` twice, `nodes[v]` is a list that now includes `u` twice.** 

The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list `nodes[v]`, so now `nodes[v]` includes `u` twice. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
