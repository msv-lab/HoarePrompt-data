The function reads an integer `n` and a tree represented by `n-1` edges. It identifies the two leaf nodes of the tree and constructs a path from one leaf node to the other. The function then reads a starting node `start` and determines the number of moves required to reach either leaf node from the starting node. If at least one of these move counts is odd, it prints 'Ron'. Otherwise, if both move counts are even, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.
