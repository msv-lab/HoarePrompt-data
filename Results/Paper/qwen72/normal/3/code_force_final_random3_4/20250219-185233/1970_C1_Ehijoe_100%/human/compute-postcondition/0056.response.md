Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all the nodes from `s` to `e` (inclusive), `prev` is the last node added to `tree` before the loop terminated, and `curr` is equal to `e`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`, `i`, `nodes`, `edges`, `empty`, `s`, `e`:** These variables remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`tree`:** The loop appends nodes to the `tree` list until `curr` is equal to `e`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `tree` will contain all the nodes from `s` to `e` (inclusive).
- **`prev`:** The variable `prev` is updated to the current node (`curr`) at each iteration. When the loop terminates, `prev` will be the last node added to `tree` before `curr` became equal to `e`.
- **`curr`:** The loop continues until `curr` is equal to `e`. Hence, after the loop completes, `curr` will be equal to `e`.
