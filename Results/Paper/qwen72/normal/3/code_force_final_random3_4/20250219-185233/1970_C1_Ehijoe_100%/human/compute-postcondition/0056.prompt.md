Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` (`s`), `prev` is the first element of `ends` (`s`), `curr` is the first element in the list `nodes[s]`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` (`s`) and the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`curr`), `prev` is now equal to the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`curr`). If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, `curr` is now the second element in the list `nodes[curr]`. Otherwise, `curr` is now the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` (which is the first element in the list `nodes[nodes[s][0]]`), and `curr` must not be equal to `e` and the first element of `nodes[curr]` is not equal to `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `prev`, and the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` (which is the previous `curr`). If `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, then `prev` is now the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`curr`), and `curr` is now the second element in the list `nodes[prev]` and must not be equal to `e`. Otherwise, `prev` is the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` (which was the previous `curr`), and `curr` is now the first element in the list `nodes[curr]` and must not be equal to `e`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `prev`, the first element in the list `nodes[prev]`, and `curr`. If `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, then `prev` is now the second element in the list `nodes[prev]` and must not be equal to `e`, and `curr` is now the third element in the list `nodes[curr]` and must not be equal to `e`. Otherwise, `curr` is now the first element in the list `nodes[curr]` and must not be equal to `e`, and `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
