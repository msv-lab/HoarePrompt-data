The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` is a list that includes `v` twice, `nodes[v]` is a list that includes `u` twice**
