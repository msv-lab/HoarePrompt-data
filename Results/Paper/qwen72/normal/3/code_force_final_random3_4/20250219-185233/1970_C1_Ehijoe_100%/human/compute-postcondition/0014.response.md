Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` is a list that includes `v` three times, `nodes[v]` is a list that includes `u` twice.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` adds the integer `v` to the list `nodes[u]`, which already contains `v` twice. Therefore, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` three times. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
