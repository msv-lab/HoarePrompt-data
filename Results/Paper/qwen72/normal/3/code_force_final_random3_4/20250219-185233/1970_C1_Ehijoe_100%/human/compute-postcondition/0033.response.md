To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the program state right before the loop.

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5
- `i` is `n-2`
- `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys
- `edges` is an empty list
- `empty` is True
- `s` is the first element of `ends`
- `e` is the second element of `ends`
- `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` (`s`)
- `prev` is the first element of `ends` (`s`)
- `curr` is the first element in the list `nodes[s]`

### Loop Condition:
```
while curr != e:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `curr` is not equal to `e`.
- `curr` is the first element in the list `nodes[s]`.
- `e` is the second element of `ends`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Check the initial values of `curr` and `e`:**
   - `curr` is the first element in the list `nodes[s]`.
   - `e` is the second element of `ends`.

2. **Determine if the loop can execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `curr` must not be equal to `e`.
   - If `nodes[s]` is empty or if the first element of `nodes[s]` is equal to `e`, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop executes:**
   - We need to ensure that `nodes[s]` is not empty and that the first element of `nodes[s]` is not equal to `e`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `nodes[s]` needs to be adjusted to ensure it contains at least one element that is not equal to `e`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` (`s`), `prev` is the first element of `ends` (`s`), `curr` is the first element in the list `nodes[s]` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`**
