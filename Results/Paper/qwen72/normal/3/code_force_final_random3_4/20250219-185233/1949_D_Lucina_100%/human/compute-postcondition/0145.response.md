Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 3, and `nx` is either increased by `xx[1][2]` if `xx[1][2]` is not '?', or `nx` is appended with 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, or `nx` is appended with 'S' otherwise.***
