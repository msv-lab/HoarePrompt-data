Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 3, `b[1]` is incremented by 1, `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[1]` by 1 because `i` is 1.
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `a[2]` and `b[2]` based on `x[j - 1]` are not affected by this code, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
