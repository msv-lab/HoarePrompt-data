Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged. `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is the corresponding character from `xx[1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', the character is 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, and 'S' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, the character is 'F'; otherwise, the character is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `xx[3][j - 1]` is not a question mark (`?`), `nx` contains the character at `xx[3][j - 1]`. If `xx[3][j - 1]` is a question mark (`?`), `nx` contains 'F' if either `i` (which is 3) or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, otherwise it contains 'S'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
