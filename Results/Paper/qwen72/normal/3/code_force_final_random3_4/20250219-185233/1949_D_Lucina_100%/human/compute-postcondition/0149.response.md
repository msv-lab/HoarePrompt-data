Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is an empty string.**

The code snippet `nx = ''` initializes the variable `nx` to an empty string. The values of `i`, `n`, `a[1]` to `a[n]`, `b[1]` to `b[n]`, `sa`, and `j` remain unchanged.
