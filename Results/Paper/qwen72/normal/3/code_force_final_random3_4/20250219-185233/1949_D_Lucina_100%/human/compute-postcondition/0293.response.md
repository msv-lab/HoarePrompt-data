The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function expects input in a specific format: an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 24, and a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters. The characters in each string can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The input matrix is symmetric, meaning the character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and the character at the i-th row and i-th column is always '.'. Additionally, at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided, meaning at most \(2 \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.

The function returns a result based on the input matrix, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we can only describe the input parameters and the general nature of the return value.

Functionality: **The function expects an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters. The characters can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and the input matrix is symmetric with the diagonal always being '.'. The function returns a result based on the input matrix, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
