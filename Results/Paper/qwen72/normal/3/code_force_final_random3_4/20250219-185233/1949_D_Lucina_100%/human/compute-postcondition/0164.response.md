Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 2, and `nx` is 'FF' if either `i` or `j` (both are 2) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`. If neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'SS'. If exactly one of `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'SF' if `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements and `j` is not, and `nx` is 'FS' if `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements and `i` is not.***
