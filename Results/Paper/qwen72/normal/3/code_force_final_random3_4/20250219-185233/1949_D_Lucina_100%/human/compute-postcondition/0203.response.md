Postcondition: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and the current values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0.**
