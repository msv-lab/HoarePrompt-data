Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings. If `b[2]` is greater than 0 and `a[2]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `sa` remains as it was initially. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain as they were initially, with `sb` now containing the integer 2.***
