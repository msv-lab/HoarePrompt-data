Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` now includes the index `1`. Otherwise, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.***
