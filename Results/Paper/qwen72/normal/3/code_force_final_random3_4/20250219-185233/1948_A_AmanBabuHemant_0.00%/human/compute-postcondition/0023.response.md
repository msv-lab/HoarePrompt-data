The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 2 and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `_`, or `n`, and `s` is not defined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.**
