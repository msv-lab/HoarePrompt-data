#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should not exceed 200 characters. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `_` is `t-1`, `t` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `_`, or `n`, and `s` is not defined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200 characters, the function prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 characters or more, the function prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each case.
