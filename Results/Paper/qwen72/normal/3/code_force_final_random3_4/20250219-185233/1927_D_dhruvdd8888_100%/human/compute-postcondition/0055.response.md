Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1).
2. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
3. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
5. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
6. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input for `l` and `r`:**
   - The user provides two integers, `l` and `r`, which are used to determine the index `eli`.

2. **Determine `eli`:**
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This means `eli` is the position in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would fit in a sorted manner.

3. **Determine `LA`:**
   - `LA` is simply the length of the list `arr`.

4. **Determine the Index for Tuple Access:**
   - The index used to access the tuple in `arr` is `min(eli, LA)`. Since `LA` is the length of `arr`, `min(eli, LA)` will be `eli` if `eli` is less than `LA`, and `LA - 1` if `eli` is equal to or greater than `LA`.

5. **Access Tuple Elements:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1). However, `_` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for the output.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `s` and the value of `e + 1`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and the second element of the tuple at the same index incremented by 1.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and e is the second element of the tuple at the same index in `arr`)**
