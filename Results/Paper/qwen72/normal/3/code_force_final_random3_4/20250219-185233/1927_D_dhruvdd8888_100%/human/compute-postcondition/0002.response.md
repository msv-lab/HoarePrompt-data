The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a string from the standard input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the length of the array `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), the array `a` (a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and a list of queries `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), where each query is a tuple of two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `input` is a string read from the standard input.
- `N` is assigned the value of the integer converted from the input string.

After executing the code snippet:
- `nums` is a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input string split by spaces.
- The value of `N` is not affected by this code snippet, as it is assigned from a different input.
- The function `func_1` and the structure of `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of test cases.
