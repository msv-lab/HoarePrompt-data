Output State: **`_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1), `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `l` and `r`.
- The values of `_`, `s`, `e`, `eli`, and `LA` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 is still valid, but it is not directly relevant to the current code snippet.
- The new values of `l` and `r` are provided by the user input and are now integers.
