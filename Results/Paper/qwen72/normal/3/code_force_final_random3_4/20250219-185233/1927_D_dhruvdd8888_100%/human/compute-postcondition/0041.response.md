Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr`.
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is less than `r`.
   - The current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `min(eli, LA)` will be the index used to access the tuple in `arr`. Since `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `LA` is the length of `arr`, `min(eli, LA)` will be the smallest of these two values.
   - The tuple at this index in `arr` is `(s, e, _)`.
   - `s` is the first element of this tuple and is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is the second element of this tuple and is less than `r`.
   - The print statement will output `s` and `e + 1`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and it is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and it is less than `r`.
   - The print statement will output `s` and `e + 1`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr and is less than or equal to l, and e is the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr and is less than r)**
