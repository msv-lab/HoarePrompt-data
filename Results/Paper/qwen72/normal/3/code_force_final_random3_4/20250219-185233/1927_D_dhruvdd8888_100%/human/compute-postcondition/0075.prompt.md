You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the length of the array `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), the array `a` (a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and a list of queries `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), where each query is a tuple of two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is the last element in the `nums` list (which is `-1`), and `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the index of the last segment's start position.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The variable `_` is the number of times the loop has executed, which is equal to the integer value provided by `int(input())`. The variable `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. The values of `s`, `e`, and `num` after the loop depends on the conditions evaluated during each iteration, but the final state will be such that the conditions for the last iteration are met.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case contains an integer `n`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of queries `q`. For each query `(l, r)` in `q`, the function returns a result based on the array `a` and the indices `l` and `r`. The results are collected into a list and returned.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
