You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the length of the array `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), the array `a` (a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and a list of queries `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), where each query is a tuple of two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is the last element in the `nums` list (which is `-1`), and `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the index of the last segment's start position.

        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The variable `_` is the number of times the loop has executed, which is equal to the integer value provided by `int(input())`. The variable `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. The values of `s`, `e`, and `num` after the loop depends on the conditions evaluated during each iteration, but the final state will be such that the conditions for the last iteration are met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an input array. It reads an integer `N` representing the length of the array, followed by the array itself. It then reads a series of queries, each consisting of two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, the function determines and prints a pair of indices that represent the boundaries of a segment in the array where the segment starts and ends with the same number, and this segment is adjacent to the range `[l, r]`. If no such segment exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It creates an array `arr` to store tuples of the form `(start, end, value)` where `start` and `end` are the indices of a segment of the array where all elements are equal to `value`.

3. **Segment Identification**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and identifies segments where all elements are the same.
   - It appends these segments to `arr` as tuples `(1 + s, i, num)`, where `s` is the start index of the segment and `i` is the end index of the segment.
   - The `+1` in `1 + s` is to convert from 0-based indexing to 1-based indexing.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the range `[l, r]`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It retrieves the segment `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at index `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the range `[l, r]`.

5. **Conditions for Valid Pair**:
   - If `s > l`, it checks if `s == 1` or `s > r`. If either condition is true, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair). Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
   - If `e >= r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).
   - If `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive equal elements.
- The use of `bisect_left` helps in efficiently finding the starting segment within the query range.
- The conditions for checking the validity of the pair `(i, j)` are logically sound:
  - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks if the segment starts at the beginning of the array or is outside the query range.
  - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it means the segment covers the entire query range, and no valid pair exists.
  - If the end of the segment is less than `N` or `l`, it prints a valid pair from the segment.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where the segment identified by `bisect_left` is exactly at the boundary of the query range. For example, if the segment starts at `l` and ends at `r`, and all elements in this segment are the same, the program should print `-1 -1`.
- The condition `if s > l` and `if e >= r` are not mutually exclusive, and the program might print `-1 -1` incorrectly in some cases.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is generally correct, but it has a potential issue with handling boundary conditions for segments that exactly match the query range.

### Conclusion:
- Given the potential issue with boundary conditions, the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
