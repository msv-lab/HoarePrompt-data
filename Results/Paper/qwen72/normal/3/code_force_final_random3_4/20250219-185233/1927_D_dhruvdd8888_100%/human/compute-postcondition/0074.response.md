The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing three elements: 
1. `n` (an integer representing the length of the array, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5),
2. `a` (a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6),
3. `q` (a list of queries, where each query is a tuple of two integers `l` and `r` with the constraint 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n).

The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a query in the `test_cases` list. The result for each query is based on the array `a` and the indices `l` and `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case contains an integer `n`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of queries `q`. For each query `(l, r)` in `q`, the function returns a result based on the array `a` and the indices `l` and `r`. The results are collected into a list and returned.**
