Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`, `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1, 1, num)` at the end, `s` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a new tuple to the list `arr`.
- The tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` is calculated as follows:
  - `1 + s` evaluates to `1` because `s` is 0.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`.
- Therefore, the tuple `(1, 1, num)` is appended to `arr`.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `num`, and `s` remain unchanged.
