Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
2. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
3. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
5. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
6. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr`.
8. `s` is greater than `l`.
9. `s` is not equal to 1.
10. `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0, but this value is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.

2. **Determine `eli` and `LA`:**
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr`.

3. **Determine the Tuple at `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - The index `min(eli, LA)` is used to access a tuple in `arr`.
   - `s` is the first element of this tuple.
   - `e` is the second element of this tuple.
   - `_` is the third element of this tuple.

4. **Conditions on `s`:**
   - `s` is greater than `l`.
   - `s` is not equal to 1.
   - `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

### What is Printed:
The `print` statement will output the values of `s - 1` and `s`.

- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `s - 1` is the value of `s` minus 1.

Since `s` is greater than `l` and less than or equal to `r`, and `s` is not equal to 1, the output will be:
- The value of `s - 1`.
- The value of `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and s is greater than `l`, not equal to 1, and less than or equal to `r`)**
