The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `N + 1`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `N` must still be a non-negative integer such that `i` is less than `N + 1`.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`, `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1, 0, num)` at the end if the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, `s` is 0**
