Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
2. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
3. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
5. `l` and `r` are the integers provided by the user input.
6. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is very straightforward. It prints the values `-1` and `-1`.
- The values of `s`, `e`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, and `LA` are not used in the `print` statement itself.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 2 is irrelevant to the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on this condition.

### Output:
The `print` statement will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the initial state or any user input.
Output: **-1, -1**
