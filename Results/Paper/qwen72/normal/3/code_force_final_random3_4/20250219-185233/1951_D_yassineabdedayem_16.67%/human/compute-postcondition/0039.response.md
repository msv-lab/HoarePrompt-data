Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met), `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration. Additionally, `k` is 0.**
