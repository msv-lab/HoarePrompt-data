To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable.
   - `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of `number`.
   - `i` is the second element in `tab`.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
   - `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is the second element in the list `tab`.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of `number`.
   - Since `i` is the second element in `tab`, it will be the second string representation of `number`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `tab` followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be:

Output: **[second element of tab] (where the second element of tab is the second string representation of number)**
