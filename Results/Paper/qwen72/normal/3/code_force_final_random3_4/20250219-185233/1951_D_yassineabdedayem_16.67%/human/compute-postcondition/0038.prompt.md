Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is equal to `Min` and `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is set to `k - Min`. `n` is now equal to `n - Min * Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 3, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it twice, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
