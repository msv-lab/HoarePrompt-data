Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is the last element in `tab` if `k` is 0 (which is `None` since `tab` is empty), `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration, and `number` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` from its previous value, `k` is a positive integer, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list with one element, which is the string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is updated based on the condition: if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number` is equal to `Min` and `k` is updated to `k - Max`; otherwise, `number` is equal to `Max`, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `rep` is 2, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated to either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number` and the second element is the string representation of the current `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `rep` is 3, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is updated to either `k - Max` or `k - Min` and must be greater than zero, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with three elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number`, the second element is the string representation of the current `number`, and the third element is the string representation of the current `number` after the update, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is now `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
