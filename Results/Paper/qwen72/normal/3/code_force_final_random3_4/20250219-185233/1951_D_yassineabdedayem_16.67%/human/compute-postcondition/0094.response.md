Initial State: `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a number, `i` is the first element of `tab`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `tab` is a list that contains at least one string representation of a number.
2. `i` is assigned the value of the first element of `tab`.
3. The `print` statement is called with `i` as the argument and `end=' '` to specify that a space should be appended after printing `i`.

Since `i` is the first element of `tab` and `tab` contains string representations of numbers, `i` will be a string representation of a number.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the first element of the list `tab`, which is a string representation of a number)**
