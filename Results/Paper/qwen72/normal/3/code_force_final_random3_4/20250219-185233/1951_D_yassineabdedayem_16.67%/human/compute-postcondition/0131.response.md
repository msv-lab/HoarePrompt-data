Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `k + Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int((n - Min * Max) / k), k)`**

Explanation:
- The values of `rep`, `k`, `t`, `tab`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated based on the new value of `n`, which is `n - Min * Max`.
- The new `Min` is calculated as `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`.
- The new `Max` is calculated as `max(int((n - Min * Max) / k), k)`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k + Min * Max` is still valid, but the specific value of `n` is now `n - Min * Max`.
