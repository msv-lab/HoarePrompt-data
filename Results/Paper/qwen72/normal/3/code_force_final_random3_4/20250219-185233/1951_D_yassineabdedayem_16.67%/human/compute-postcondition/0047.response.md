To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable.
   - `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met).
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of `number`.
   - `i` is the third element in `tab`.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
   - `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `tab` is a list of strings, and `i` is the third element in this list.
   - Since `tab` contains at least three string representations of `number`, `i` will be the string representation of the third number in the list.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the third element of the list `tab` followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the third element of `tab` is a string representation of a number. Therefore, the output will be the string representation of the third number in `tab`.

Output: **[third element of tab] (where the third element of tab is the string representation of the third number in the list tab)**
