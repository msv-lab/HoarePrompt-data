Output State: **`rep` is 60 or less, `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `t` is 0 or a positive integer, `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration, `i` is `None`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.**

Natural language description:
- The loop will execute until one of the conditions `n == 0`, `k <= 0`, `rep >= 60`, or `n < k` is met.
- After all iterations, `rep` will be the number of times the loop has executed, which is at most 60.
- `n` will either be 0 (if it was fully reduced by the loop) or a positive integer that is less than `k` (if the loop stopped because `n < k`).
- `k` will be 0 or a positive integer, depending on how many times it was decremented during the loop.
- `t` will be 0 or a positive integer, having been decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- `tab` will contain a list of string representations of the `number` variable, one for each iteration of the loop.
- `i` will remain `None` since it is not modified within the loop.
- `Min` and `Max` will hold the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, from the last iteration of the loop.
- `n` will be the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed, reflecting the state of `n` at the end of the loop.
