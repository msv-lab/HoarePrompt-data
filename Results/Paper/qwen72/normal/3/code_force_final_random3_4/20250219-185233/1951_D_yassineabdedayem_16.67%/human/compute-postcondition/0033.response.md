Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is equal to `k - Min`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is equal to `Max`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, `n`) remain unchanged or their values are still determined by their initial conditions.
