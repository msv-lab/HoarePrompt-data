Based on the initial state, `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of numbers, and `i` is the third element of `tab`.

1. **Identify the value of `i`**: Since `i` is the third element of `tab`, and `tab` contains string representations of numbers, `i` will be the string representation of the third number in the list.

2. **Determine what is printed**: The `print` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Let's assume the list `tab` is something like `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`. In this case, the third element is `'3'`.

Output: **3 **

This means that the third string representation of a number in the list `tab` will be printed, followed by a space.
