The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again with `i` being the third element of `tab`.

At the end of the last iteration, `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of numbers, and `i` is the second element of `tab`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element of `tab`.

State: **`tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of numbers, `i` is the third element of `tab`**
