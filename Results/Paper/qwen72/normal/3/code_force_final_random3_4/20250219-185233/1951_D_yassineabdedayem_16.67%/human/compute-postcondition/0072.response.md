Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - Max`, `rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with one element, which is the string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- All other variables (`n`, `rep`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
