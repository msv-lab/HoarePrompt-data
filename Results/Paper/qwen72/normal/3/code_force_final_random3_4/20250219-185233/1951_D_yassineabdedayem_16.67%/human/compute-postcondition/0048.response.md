Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met), `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration, `i` is the last element in `tab`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains a placeholder variable.
- The variable `n` is still a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` if the loop condition is still met.
- The variable `k` is still 0.
- The variable `rep` is either 60 or the loop condition is no longer met.
- The list `tab` contains the string representations of `number` for each iteration.
- The variable `i` is the last element in the list `tab`.
- The variables `Min` and `Max` hold the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k`, respectively.
- The variable `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.
