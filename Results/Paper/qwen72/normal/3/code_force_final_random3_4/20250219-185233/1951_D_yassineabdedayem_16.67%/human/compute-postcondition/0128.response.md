Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n -= Min * Max` updates the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`.
- `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, and `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, with `n` being greater than or equal to `k`.
- The value of `n` after the execution of the code is `n - Min * Max`.
- All other variables (`rep`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n` and `k` still hold.
