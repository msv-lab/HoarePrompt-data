Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. Additionally, either `Max` is not equal to `k`, or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**
