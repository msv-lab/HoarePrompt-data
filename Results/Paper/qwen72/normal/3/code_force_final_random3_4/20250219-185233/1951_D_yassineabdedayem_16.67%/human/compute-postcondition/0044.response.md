To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in tab:
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`: This is the variable that takes the value of each element in `tab` during each iteration.
- `tab`: This is the list that is being iterated over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder variable
- `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met)
- `k` is 0
- `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met
- `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of `number`
- `i` is the first element in `tab`
- `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively
- `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `tab` must still have elements, and the variable `i` must be set to the next element in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the first element in `tab`
- `tab` contains at least one string representation of `number`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be set to the next element in `tab`
- `tab` must still have at least one more element

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met), `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of `number`, `i` is the second element in `tab`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.**
