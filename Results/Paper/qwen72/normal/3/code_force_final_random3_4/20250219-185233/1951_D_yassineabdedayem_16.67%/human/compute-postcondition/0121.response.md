Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`**

Explanation:
- `Min` and `Max` are reassigned based on the new values of `n // k` and `int(n / k)`.
- `Min` is now the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is now the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- All other variables (`rep`, `k`, `t`, `tab`, `i`) remain unchanged.
