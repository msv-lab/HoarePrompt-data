Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `t` is 0 or a positive integer.
   - `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration.
   - `i` is `None`.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
   - `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing a string literal `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about various variables, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the value of the string `'YES'` is the only thing that will be printed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
