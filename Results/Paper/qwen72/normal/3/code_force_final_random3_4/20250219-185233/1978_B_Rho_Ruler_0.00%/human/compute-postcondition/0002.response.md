Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `k` <= min(`n`, `b`), 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n - k) * a` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` was `k * b`.
- After the addition, `ans` becomes `k * b + (n - k) * a`.
- The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.
