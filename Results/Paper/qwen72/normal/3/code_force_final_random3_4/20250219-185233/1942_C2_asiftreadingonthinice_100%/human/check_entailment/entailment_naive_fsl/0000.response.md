Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The program does not handle the case where the chosen vertices are not in a contiguous block. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
8 4 2
1 3 6 8
```

In this case, the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 3, 6, and 8. The program will sort these vertices and then calculate the gaps between them. However, the logic for handling the gaps and adding vertices to maximize the number of triangles is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the gaps between the vertices and the additional vertices that can be added to form triangles.

The program will output 6, but the correct output should be 5. Here's why:

- The vertices 1, 3, 6, and 8 form the following gaps:
  - Gap between 3 and 1 (considering the polygon is cyclic): 2
  - Gap between 6 and 3: 3
  - Gap between 8 and 6: 2
  - Gap between 8 and 1 (cyclic): 3

- The program will try to add vertices to these gaps to maximize the number of triangles. However, the logic for adding vertices and calculating the number of triangles is not correct, leading to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to more carefully handle the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices that can be added to form triangles without intersecting diagonals.
