Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], and `tt` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
    tmp.sort()
    for i in tmp:
        if y >= i - 1:
            ans += i
            y -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the last element in `tmp`, `tmp` has been fully iterated, `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1 + k + sum(i for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)` if the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is exactly 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + k + sum(i for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, and `ans` is further updated to `ans + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the last element in `a`, `tmp` is a sorted list that may contain elements, each of which is the result of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range [1, len(a) - 1] where `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) != 2`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` also contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. After the loop has executed all iterations, `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, plus the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` for which `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`. `ans` is now `ans + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, and `tmp` must have at least one element. `ans` is the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` for which `y` >= `i - 1`, and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)` for each such element, plus the value of `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
