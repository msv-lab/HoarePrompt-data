Postcondition: ***`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0. After the if-else block executes, if `n` is even, `ans` is the string 'AABBCC...XY' (where the length of `ans` is `n`), `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd, `ans` is the string 'ABBACCDD...EE' (where 'EE' is the last pair of characters added, and the total number of characters in `ans` is `3 + 2 * (n // 2 - 1)`), `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.***
