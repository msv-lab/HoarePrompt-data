Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 4, `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the variable `ans` by appending the character at index `x` in the string `s` twice. Since `x` is 1, the character at index 1 in `s` is 'B'. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AABB'. The other variables remain unchanged.
