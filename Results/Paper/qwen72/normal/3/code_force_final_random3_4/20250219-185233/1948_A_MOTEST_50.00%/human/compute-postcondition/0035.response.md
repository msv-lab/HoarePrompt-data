To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is an empty string.
   - `x` is 0.

2. **After the if-else block executes:**
   - If `n` is even:
     - `ans` is the string 'AABBCC...XY' (where the length of `ans` is `n`).
     - `x` is `n // 2`.
     - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - If `n` is odd:
     - `ans` is the string 'ABBACCDD...EE' (where 'EE' is the last pair of characters added, and the total number of characters in `ans` is `3 + 2 * (n // 2 - 1)`).
     - `x` is `n // 2`.
     - `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.

3. **Determine the value of `ans` based on the parity of `n`:**
   - **If `n` is even:**
     - `ans` will be a string where each character from `s` is repeated twice, and the total length of `ans` is `n`.
     - For example, if `n` is 6, `ans` will be 'AABBCC'.
   - **If `n` is odd:**
     - `ans` will be a string where the first character is repeated once, and each subsequent character is repeated twice until the total length of `ans` is `3 + 2 * (n // 2 - 1)`.
     - For example, if `n` is 5, `ans` will be 'ABBCC'.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` based on the parity of `n`.

**Output:**
- **If `n` is even:**
  - Output: **AABBCC...XY (where the length of the string is `n` and each character from `s` is repeated twice)**
- **If `n` is odd:**
  - Output: **ABBACCDD...EE (where 'EE' is the last pair of characters added, and the total number of characters in the string is `3 + 2 * (n // 2 - 1)`)**
