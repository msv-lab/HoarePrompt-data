The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. Before the loop starts, `j` should be 1 for the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` should be 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
