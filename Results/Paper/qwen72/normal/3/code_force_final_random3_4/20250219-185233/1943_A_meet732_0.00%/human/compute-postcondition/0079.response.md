Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of the element in the `cntl` list at the index `i` by 1. The value of `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. The initial state of `a` and `i` remains unchanged, but the value at `cntl[i]` is now one more than it was before the code was executed.
