Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `n` must be at least 3, and `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `cntl`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
