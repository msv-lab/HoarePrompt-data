The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 to allow the next iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
