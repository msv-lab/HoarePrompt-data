Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program uses a variable `c` to track the number of elements Alice can add to the array `c` before Bob can interfere. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the optimal moves of both players.
   - The MEX calculation should consider the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after all elements have been processed.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice and Bob making moves that ensure the MEX is as high as possible for Alice and as low as possible for Bob.
   - Alice should always try to add the smallest missing integer to `c` that is not yet in `a`, while Bob should try to remove the smallest integer that is in `a` but not yet in `c`.

3. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if `cntl[0]` is zero, the MEX is zero. This is not always true. For example, if the array `a` is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the MEX should be 0, but the program would print 0 without considering the actual elements.
   - The program also incorrectly decrements `c` and prints `j` without fully considering the optimal moves of both players.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and ensure that both players make optimal moves. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] == 0:
                mex = j
                break
            elif cntl[j] == 1:
                if (n - j) % 2 == 1:
                    mex = j
                    break
        print(mex)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Count Occurrences**:
   - We count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` using the `cntl` list.

2. **Determine MEX**:
   - We iterate through the possible values from 0 to `n` to find the MEX.
   - If `cntl[j]` is 0, it means `j` is not in the array `a`, so the MEX is `j`.
   - If `cntl[j]` is 1, it means `j` is in the array `a` but only once. If the number of remaining elements (including `j`) is odd, Alice can ensure that `j` is added to `c` and thus the MEX is `j`.

3. **Output**:
   - The MEX is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the MEX is calculated correctly.
