The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least three integers, the loop will execute again for the third integer in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `cntl[i]` is now 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three integers, and `i` will be the third integer in the list.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `n` is an input integer, `cntl[i]` is now 2**
