Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` has one more element, which is `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` includes 'Bob' as its last element.***
