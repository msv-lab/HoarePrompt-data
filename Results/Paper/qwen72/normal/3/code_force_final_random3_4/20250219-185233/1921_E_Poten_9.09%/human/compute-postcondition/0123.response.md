The provided code snippet reads a space-separated list of integers from the user and assigns it to the variable `clues`. This impacts the value of `clues` but does not change the values of `test_cases` or `i`. The conditions described in the initial state remain the same, but `clues` now holds the specific values provided by the user.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
