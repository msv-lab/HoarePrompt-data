Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game when Alice and Bob are on the same row but different columns is flawed. Here's an example where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 4 2 1 2 4
```
Expected Output:
```
Draw
```
Actual Output:
```
Bob
```
In this case, Alice and Bob start on the same row (2), but Alice is on column 1 and Bob is on column 4. Since Alice and Bob are on the same row, they cannot move to each other's position, and the game should end in a draw. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" as the winner. This indicates that the program does not handle this specific edge case correctly.
