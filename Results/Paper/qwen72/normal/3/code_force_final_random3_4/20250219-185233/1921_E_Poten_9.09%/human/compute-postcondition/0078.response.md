Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, and either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains the string 'Alice'. Otherwise, `answers` contains either the string 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the following conditions: If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and if `clues[1] - clues[5]` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, and if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. In all other cases, `answers` contains 'Alice'.**
