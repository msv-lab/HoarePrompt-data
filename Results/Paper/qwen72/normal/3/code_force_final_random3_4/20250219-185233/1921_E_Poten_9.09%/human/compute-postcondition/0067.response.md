Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, and either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. Moreover, it is not the case that `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2, and it is also not the case that `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2.**
