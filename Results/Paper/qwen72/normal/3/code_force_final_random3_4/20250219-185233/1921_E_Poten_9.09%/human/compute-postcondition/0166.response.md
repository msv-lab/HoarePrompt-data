The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `answers` list. If the list has at least two strings, the loop will execute again for the second string. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` has at least one string, and `j` is the first string in the `answers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least two strings, and `j` will be the second string in the `answers` list.

State: **`answers` is a list that must have at least two strings ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the second string in the `answers` list**
