The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `test_cases` must still be greater than `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1, and `test_cases` must be greater than 1.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[2]` > `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` == 1, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'`. Otherwise, if both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even or both are odd, `answers` contains `'Bob'` if `clues[3]` == `clues[5]`, and `'Draw'` otherwise if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and the conditions for `clues[3] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` being greater than or equal to the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2 are met. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, `answers` contains `'Draw'` if the conditions for `clues[3] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` being greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2 are met, and `'Bob'` otherwise. If either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd, `answers` contains `'Alice'` if `clues[3]` == `clues[5]`, and `'Draw'` otherwise if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and the conditions for `clues[1] - clues[5]` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` being greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2 are met. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, and the conditions for `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` being greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2 are met, `answers` contains `'Draw'`. In all other cases, `answers` contains `'Alice'`.**
