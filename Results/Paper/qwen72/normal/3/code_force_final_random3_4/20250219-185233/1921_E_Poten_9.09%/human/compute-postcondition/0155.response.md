The code snippet `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. The initial state does not provide information about the list `answers`, so we assume it is an existing list. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `answers` now includes the string 'Alice'.**
