The code snippet `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state indicates that `test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. The list `answers` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it exists but its initial content is unknown. After the code is executed, the list `answers` will have one more element, which is `'Draw'`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `answers` has one more element, which is `'Draw'`.**
