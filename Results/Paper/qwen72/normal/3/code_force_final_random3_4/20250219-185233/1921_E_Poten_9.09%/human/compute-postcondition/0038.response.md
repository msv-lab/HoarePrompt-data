Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, and either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1. If `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
