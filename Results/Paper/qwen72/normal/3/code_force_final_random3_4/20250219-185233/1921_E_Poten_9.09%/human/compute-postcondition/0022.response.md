Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, and either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1. Furthermore, `clues[3] - 1` is less than or equal to `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `clues[5] - clues[3]` is less than or equal to `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.**
