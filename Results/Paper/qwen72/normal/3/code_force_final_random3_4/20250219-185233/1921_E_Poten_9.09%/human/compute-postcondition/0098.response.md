Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` and either `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` has a new element 'Draw' appended to it. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` and neither of the above conditions is met, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob'. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1` and either `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` is a list that includes the string 'Draw' as its first element. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1` and neither of the above conditions is met, `answers` is a list that contains the string 'Bob'.***
