The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first character of `s`, and `s` is a non-empty string. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to the next character in `s`, and `s` must still be a non-empty string.

Given that `j` is the first character of `s`, and assuming `s` has more than one character, the next character will be the second character of `s`. The state of `s` remains unchanged as it is still a non-empty string.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is 1, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the second character of `s`**.
