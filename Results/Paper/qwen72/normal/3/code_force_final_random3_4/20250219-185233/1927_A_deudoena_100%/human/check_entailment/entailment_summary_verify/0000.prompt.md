You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from user input. It then calculates and returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' character and the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s` (both 1-indexed), plus 2. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `test_cases` as described in the annotations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum length of the segment to be painted white is flawed. The program only considers the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string, but it does not account for scenarios where the black cells are not at the edges of the strip.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
WBBBW
```
The expected output should be `3` because the minimum segment that needs to be painted is from the 2nd to the 4th cell. However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly calculates the segment length based on the first and last 'B' characters.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
