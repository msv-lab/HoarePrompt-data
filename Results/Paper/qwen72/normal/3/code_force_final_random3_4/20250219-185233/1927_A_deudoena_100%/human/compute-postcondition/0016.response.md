The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which is derived from the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next character in `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second character of `s`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` must be the third character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character of `s`**
