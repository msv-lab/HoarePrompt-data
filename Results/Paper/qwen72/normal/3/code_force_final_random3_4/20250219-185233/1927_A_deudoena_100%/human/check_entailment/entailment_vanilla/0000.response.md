Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
   - It then iterates `n` times to process each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, which are intended to store the indices of the first and last black cells, respectively.
   - It reads the length of the strip, `m`, and the strip itself, `s`, from the input.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` to find the index of the first black cell (`'B'`).
   - It increments `c` for each character and sets `mi` to `c` when it encounters the first black cell.
   - The loop breaks as soon as the first black cell is found.

4. **Finding the Last Black Cell**:
   - The program then iterates over the string `s` in reverse to find the index of the last black cell.
   - It increments `d` for each character and sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` when it encounters the last black cell.
   - The loop breaks as soon as the last black cell is found.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The program calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted white as `ma - mi + 2`.
   - This formula is intended to cover the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.

6. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1`.

### Issues:
- **Index Calculation**:
  - The calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to include both the first and last black cells in the segment length.
  - The variable `mi` is set to `c` which is 1-based (since `c` starts from 1 and increments for each character). However, `ma` is set to `len(s) - d` which is 0-based (since `d` starts from 1 and increments for each character in reverse).
  - This mismatch in indexing can lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Formula:
- The correct formula to calculate the minimum segment length should be:
  - `mi` should be the 1-based index of the first black cell.
  - `ma` should be the 1-based index of the last black cell.
  - The segment length should be `ma - mi + 1`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d + 1  # Corrected to 1-based index
            break
    return ma - mi + 1  # Corrected formula
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has an issue with the calculation of the segment length due to incorrect indexing and formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
