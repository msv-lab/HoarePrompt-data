Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- The variable `c` keeps track of the position in the string (1-indexed).
- If the loop encounters a 'B' character, it updates `mi` to the current position `c` and then breaks out of the loop.
- If there is no 'B' character in the string, the loop will iterate through the entire string, and `mi` and `c` will both remain 0.
- After the loop completes, `mi` and `c` will both be the position of the first 'B' character in `s`.
- The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `ma`, `m`, `d`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
