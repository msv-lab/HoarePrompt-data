Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `c` is 0, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in s:
    c += 1
    if j == 'B':
        mi = c
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is 1, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the first character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', `mi` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the second character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', `mi` is updated to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 3 if the third character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
