The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over the characters in `s` in reverse order. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the character before the last character that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be the next character in the reversed string `s`.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string and the loop iterates over `s` in reverse, the next character `j` will be the one before the current `j` in the reversed string. If the last character in `s` was 'B' and the condition was met, the loop will continue to the next character in the reversed string.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string. `ma` is updated to `len(s) - 2` if `j` is 'B' and the condition was met, otherwise `ma` remains `len(s) - 1` if the last character in `s` is 'B', or `ma` remains 0. `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the character before the last character that was processed in the previous iteration. The next character `j` in the reversed string `s` will be the one before the current `j` in the reversed string.**
