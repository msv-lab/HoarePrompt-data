Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to properly handle the input:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

With the updated function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string.**
