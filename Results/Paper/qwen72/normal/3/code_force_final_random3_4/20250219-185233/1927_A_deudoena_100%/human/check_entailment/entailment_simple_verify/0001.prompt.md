You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string.

    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is the position of the last 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `d` is the position of the last 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `l` is an empty list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
   - It then iterates `n` times to process each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, which are intended to store the indices of the first and last black cells, respectively.
   - It reads the length of the strip, `m`, and the strip itself, `s`, from the input.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` to find the index of the first black cell (`'B'`).
   - It increments `c` for each character and sets `mi` to `c` when it encounters the first black cell.
   - The loop breaks as soon as the first black cell is found.

4. **Finding the Last Black Cell**:
   - The program then iterates over the string `s` in reverse to find the index of the last black cell.
   - It increments `d` for each character and sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` when it encounters the last black cell.
   - The loop breaks as soon as the last black cell is found.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The program calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted white as `ma - mi + 2`.
   - This formula is intended to cover the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.

6. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1`.

### Issues:
- **Index Calculation**:
  - The calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to include both the first and last black cells in the segment length.
  - The variable `mi` is set to `c` which is 1-based (since `c` starts from 1 and increments for each character). However, `ma` is set to `len(s) - d` which is 0-based (since `d` starts from 1 and increments for each character in reverse).
  - This mismatch in indexing can lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Formula:
- The correct formula to calculate the minimum segment length should be:
  - `mi` should be the 1-based index of the first black cell.
  - `ma` should be the 1-based index of the last black cell.
  - The segment length should be `ma - mi + 1`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d + 1  # Corrected to 1-based index
            break
    return ma - mi + 1  # Corrected formula
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has an issue with the calculation of the segment length due to incorrect indexing and formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
