Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is the position of the last 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `d` is the position of the last 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `l` is an empty list.**

Natural language description: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `ma` will be updated to the position of the last 'B' character in the string `s` (1-indexed). The variable `d` will also be updated to the position of the last 'B' character in the string `s` (1-indexed). All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `mi`, `m`, `s`, `c`, `l`) will remain unchanged. The loop stops as soon as it encounters the last 'B' character in the reversed string `s`.
