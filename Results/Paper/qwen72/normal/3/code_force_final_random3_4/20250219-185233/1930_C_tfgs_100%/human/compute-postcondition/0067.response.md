Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements that were added during the loop execution to fill the gap up to `n` elements, with the last element now being `ans[-2] - 1` and the second last element being `ans[-2] - 1` + 1, `counter` is a Counter object with all counts of elements in `a` reduced to 0, `cnt` is greater than 0, `cur` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`.
- The new element is `ans[-1] - 1`, which means the last element of `ans` is reduced by 1.
- The second last element of `ans` remains `ans[-2] - 1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `counter`, `cnt`, `cur`) remain unchanged.
