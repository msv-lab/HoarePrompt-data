The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `cnt`. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be greater than 0. The state of `i`, `ans`, `counter`, and `cur` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `cnt` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements that were added during the loop execution to fill the gap up to `n` elements, `counter` is a Counter object with all counts of elements in `a` reduced to 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `cur` is 0**
