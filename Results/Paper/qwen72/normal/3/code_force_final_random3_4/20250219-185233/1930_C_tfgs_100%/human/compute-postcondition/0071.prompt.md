You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 \leq t \leq 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9, representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements that were added during the loop execution to fill the gap up to `n` elements, `counter` is a Counter object with all counts of elements in `a` reduced to 0, `cnt` is 0, and `cur` is 0.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements that were added during the loop execution to fill the gap up to `n` elements, with the last `cnt` elements being a decreasing sequence starting from `ans[-cnt-1] - 1` and ending at `ans[-1]` which is `ans[-cnt-1] - cnt`, `counter` is a Counter object with all counts of elements in `a` reduced to 0, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [elements of list a separated by spaces]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the input array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
