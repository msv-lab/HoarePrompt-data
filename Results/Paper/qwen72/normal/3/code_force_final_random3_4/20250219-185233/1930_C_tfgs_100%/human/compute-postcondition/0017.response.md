Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.**

Explanation:
- `adv` is assigned the value of the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.
- Since `cur` is 0, `adv` will be 0 unless `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` or `cnt` is negative, which is not possible given the constraints.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
