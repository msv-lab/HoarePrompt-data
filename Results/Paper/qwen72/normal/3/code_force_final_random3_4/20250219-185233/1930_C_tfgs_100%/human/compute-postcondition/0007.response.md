Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, `a[2]` is increased by 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[2]` is incremented by 3.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
- The updated value of `a[2]` is `a[2] + 3`.
