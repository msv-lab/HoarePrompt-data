Output State: **`n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` and `res[c]` are updated based on the first element of `s` and the values of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` and `MOD`, and `l` or `r` is updated accordingly.**

Explanation:
- `c` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
- The value of `k` remains 1.
- If the first element of `s` is 'L':
  - `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
  - `l` is incremented by 1.
  - `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.
- Otherwise:
  - `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
  - `r` is decremented by 1.
  - `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.
