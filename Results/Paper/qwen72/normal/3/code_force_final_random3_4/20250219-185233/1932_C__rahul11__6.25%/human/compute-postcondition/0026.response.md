The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, the character at index `k` in the string `s` is not 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is `r - 1`.
