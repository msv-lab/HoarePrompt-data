Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now incremented by an additional 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this additional increment of `l` while maintaining the other conditions and values as specified in the initial state.
