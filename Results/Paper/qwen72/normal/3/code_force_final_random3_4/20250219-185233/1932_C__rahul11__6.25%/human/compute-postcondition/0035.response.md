Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is `r - 2`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so if it was initially `r - 1`, it is now `r - 2`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `c`, `ans`, and `res[c]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
