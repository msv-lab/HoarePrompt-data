Output State: **`n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
- `k` remains 1.
- `c` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- `r` is decremented by 1.
- `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.

Since the code snippet only contains `r -= 1`, the only change is that `r` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
