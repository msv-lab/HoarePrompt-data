Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `n - 1`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is the result of dividing `ans` by the elements of `arr` based on the characters in `s` and taking modulo `MOD`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`.
- The initial state variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, `ans`, `res`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `arr` is now a list of integers provided by the user, which is added to the output state.
