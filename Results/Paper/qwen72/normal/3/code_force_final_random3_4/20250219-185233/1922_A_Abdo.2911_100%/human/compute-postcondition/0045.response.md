The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 1 and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, and `possible` is either True or False depending on the conditions within the loop. If `possible` is True, `possible` remains True. If `possible` is False, `possible` remains False.**
