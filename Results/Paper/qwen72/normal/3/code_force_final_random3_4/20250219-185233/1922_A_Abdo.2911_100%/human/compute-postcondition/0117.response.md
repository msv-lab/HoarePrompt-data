Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, `possible` is also set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
