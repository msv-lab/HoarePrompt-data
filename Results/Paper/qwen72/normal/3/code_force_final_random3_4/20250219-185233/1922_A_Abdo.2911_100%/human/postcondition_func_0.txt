The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. The function checks if there is any index `i` where either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such an index is found for any test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
