Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` retains its original value.***
