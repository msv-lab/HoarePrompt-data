Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output).
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (This variable is also not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (This variable is used to determine the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`).
- `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `i` is `n - 1` (This variable is used to index the last character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`).
- `possible` is `True` (This variable is not used in the print statement, but it indicates that the conditions are met).

The conditions provided are:
1. There exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`.
2. There exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`.

Given that `possible` is `True`, it means that at least one of these conditions is met. The print statement `print('YES')` will execute, and it will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
