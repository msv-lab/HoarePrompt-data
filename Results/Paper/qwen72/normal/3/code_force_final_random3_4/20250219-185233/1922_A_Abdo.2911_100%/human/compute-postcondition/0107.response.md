Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains `False` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
