Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n + 1`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.**
