Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It iterates through each test case, checks the conditions for the existence of a template that matches strings `a` and `b` but not `c`, and prints the appropriate output. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - For each position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, the program checks if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If they are equal, it then checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (and thus `b[i]`). If this condition is met, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either, it continues to the next position. If `c[i]` is different from both, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
3. **Output**: After processing all positions, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic correctly identifies whether there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not, based on the given conditions. The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.
