Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n + 1`, `possible` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `True`, overriding any previous value it might have had. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `possible` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
