### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a variable `possible` to `False` to track whether a valid template can be found.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1` and checks the following conditions:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then the template must have an uppercase letter at position `i` that is different from the lowercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then the template can be valid, and `possible` is set to `True`.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then the template must have a lowercase letter at position `i` that matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then the template cannot be valid, and the loop continues to the next position.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then the template can be valid, and `possible` is set to `True`.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - If `possible` is `False`, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must have an uppercase letter at position `i` that is different from the lowercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
  - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template must have a lowercase letter at position `i` that matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
  - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the loop continues.
  - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - `n = 1`, `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`
  - `a[0] == b[0]` is `False`, so we check if `c[0]` is different from both `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
  - `c[0]` is "c", which is different from both "a" and "b". Therefore, `possible` is set to `True`, and the output is "YES".

- **Example 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`
  - `a[0] == b[0]` is `False`, so we check if `c[0]` is different from both `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
  - `c[0]` is "a", which is equal to `a[0]`. Therefore, `possible` remains `False`.
  - `a[1] == b[1]` is `False`, so we check if `c[1]` is different from both `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
  - `c[1]` is "a", which is equal to `a[1]`. Therefore, `possible` remains `False`.
  - The output is "NO".

- **Example 3:**
  - `n = 10`, `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`
  - `a[0] != b[0]`, and `c[0]` is "a", which is different from both "m" and "l". Therefore, `possible` is set to `True`, and the output is "YES".

- **Example 4:**
  - `n = 3`, `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`
  - `a[0] != b[0]`, and `c[0]` is "a", which is equal to `a[0]`. Therefore, `possible` remains `False`.
  - `a[1] != b[1]`, and `c[1]` is "b", which is equal to `b[1]`. Therefore, `possible` remains `False`.
  - `a[2] == b[2]`, and `c[2]` is "c", which is different from `a[2]` (or `b[2]`). Therefore, `possible` is set to `True`, and the output is "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions are checked accurately, and the output is correct for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
