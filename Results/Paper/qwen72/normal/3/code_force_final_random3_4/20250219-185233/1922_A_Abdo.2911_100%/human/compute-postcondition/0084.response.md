Postcondition: **_ is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an input integer, a is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, b is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, c is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, i is n-1, and possible is True. At least one of the following conditions is met: (1) There exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or (2) There exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`.**
