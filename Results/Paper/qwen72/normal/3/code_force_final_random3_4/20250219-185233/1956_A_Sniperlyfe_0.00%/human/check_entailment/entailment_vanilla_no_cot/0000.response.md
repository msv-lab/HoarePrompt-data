Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Output Timing:** The program prints the results inside the loop for each `n` in `qs`. This will cause the program to print partial results multiple times, which is not what the problem statement requires. The output should be printed only once per test case, after all the results for `n_i` have been computed.

2. **Result Collection:** The results are collected in the list `res`, but the program prints the entire list `res` after each iteration of the inner loop. This means that the list `res` will be printed multiple times, and the output will be incorrect.

3. **Test Case Handling:** The function `func_2` should handle each test case separately, and the output for each test case should be printed on a new line. The current implementation does not separate the outputs for different test cases.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:
- **Output Timing:** The `print` statement is moved outside the inner loop, ensuring that the results for each test case are printed only once.
- **Result Collection:** The results are collected in the list `res` and printed after all the results for a given test case have been computed.
- **Test Case Handling:** Each test case is handled separately, and the output for each test case is printed on a new line.

This corrected version should now produce the correct output for the given problem.
