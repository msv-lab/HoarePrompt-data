Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of k integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs` for all `t` iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the following conditions must hold true:
- The variable `t` must have been greater than 0 initially, and it has now completed all its iterations.
- For each iteration, `k` and `q` were provided as positive integers within the specified range.
- `p` was provided as a list of `k` integers, where the integers are in strictly increasing order and within the specified range.
- `qs` was provided as a list of `q` integers, where each integer is within the specified range.
- `res` is a list that contains the results of the function `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs`, and this list is printed for each of the `t` iterations.
