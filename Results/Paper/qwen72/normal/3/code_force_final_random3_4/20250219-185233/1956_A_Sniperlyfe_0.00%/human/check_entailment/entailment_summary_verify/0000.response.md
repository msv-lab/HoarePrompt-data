### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, followed by the list `p` and the list `qs`.
   - It then processes each integer `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`.
   - However, the function immediately prints the results after each query is processed, which is incorrect. The results for each test case should be printed together on a single line after processing all queries for that test case.

2. **Function `func_1` Behavior:**
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing the players at positions specified in `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - It returns the number of remaining players, which is the correct output for each query.

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` processes each test case independently, but it fails to print the results for each test case on a separate line.
   - This means that the output for different test cases will be mixed, leading to incorrect formatting and potentially incorrect results.

4. **Example Input and Output:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     2
     2 1
     3 5
     5
     5 3
     2 4 6 7 9
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     2
     1 1 1
     ```
   - However, the program will produce:
     ```
     2
     1
     1
     1
     ```
   - This is incorrect because the results for the second test case are not printed on a single line as required.

### Final Evaluation:
- **Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the input and output format as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it prints the results immediately after each query is processed, rather than collecting all results for a test case and printing them together at the end. Additionally, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly, leading to mixed results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
