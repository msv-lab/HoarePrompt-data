The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` will be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.**
