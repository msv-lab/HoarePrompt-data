Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the first element of `qs`.** 

The value of `n` remains the first element of `qs`. The `res` list, which was initially empty, now contains the result of the function `func_1` when called with `n` and `p` as arguments. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
