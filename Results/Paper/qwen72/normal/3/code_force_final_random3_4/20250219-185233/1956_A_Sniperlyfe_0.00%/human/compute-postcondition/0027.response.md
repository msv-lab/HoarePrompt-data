The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `qs`. The loop iterates over the elements of `qs`, assigning each element to `n` in sequence. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `qs` must have at least one more element after the current `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `q` is an input integer
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`
- `n` is the second element of `qs`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The list `qs` must have at least 3 elements, so that `n` can be assigned the third element of `qs` in the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the third element of `qs`**
