Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended twice, `n` is the third element of `qs`.**

The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res` again, so `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended three times. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged.
