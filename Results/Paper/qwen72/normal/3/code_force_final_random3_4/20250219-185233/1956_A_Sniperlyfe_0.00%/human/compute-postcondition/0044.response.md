To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `k` is an input integer.
3. `q` is an input integer.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements.
6. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times.
7. `n` is the third element in `qs`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n`**:
   - `n` is the third element in the list `qs`. Since `qs` must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a specific integer value from `qs`.

2. **Determine `res`**:
   - `res` is a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times. This means that `res` will have three elements, and each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Determine the output of `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact output. However, we know that it takes two arguments: `n` (an integer from `qs`) and `p` (a list of integers provided by the user).

4. **Construct `res`**:
   - `res` will be a list of three identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`. Let's denote the result of `func_1(n, p)` as `result_value`.

5. **Convert `res` to a string**:
   - The `map(str, res)` function converts each element in `res` to a string.
   - The `' '.join(map(str, res))` function joins these string elements with a space.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the three elements of `res` separated by spaces. Since each element in `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be three identical values.

Output: **result_value result_value result_value (where result_value is the result of func_1(n, p) and n is the third element in the list qs)**
