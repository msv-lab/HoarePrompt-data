The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, each with two integer parameters `n` and `m`. The function should accept an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should accept two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.

However, the function signature provided does not include any parameters. Therefore, the function must be designed to read input from an external source, such as standard input, to receive the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.**
