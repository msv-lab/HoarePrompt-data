The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`. It checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative. If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the input values `n` and `m` have been processed and the appropriate message has been printed based on the condition.
