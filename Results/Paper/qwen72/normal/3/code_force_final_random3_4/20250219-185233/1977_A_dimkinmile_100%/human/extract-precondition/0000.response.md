Precondition: **The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters `n` and `m`, and the input should be structured such that the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).**

Here is the corrected function definition:
```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m`.
