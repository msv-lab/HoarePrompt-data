Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined with parameters `n` and `m`.
   - The input is structured such that the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
   - Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).
   - `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input.
   - The difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is a simple statement that prints the string `'Yes'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions for the input values `n` and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement will be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
