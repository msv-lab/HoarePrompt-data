Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.
3. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
4. Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input.
5. It checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative. This is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves:
   - If `(n - m)` is even, it means that the number of moves required to add or remove cubes to reach `m` cubes is balanced (i.e., the number of additions and removals can be equal or differ by an even number).
   - If `(n - m)` is non-negative, it means that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the number of cubes `m` that Nikita wants to have in the tower.

The program prints "Yes" if both conditions are met, and "No" otherwise, which is the correct logic for the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
