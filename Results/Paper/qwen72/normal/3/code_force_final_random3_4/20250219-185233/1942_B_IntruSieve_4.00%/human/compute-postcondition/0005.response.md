The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `minn`, `arr`, `mex`, and `maxx` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0 (which is the default behavior of `range(n)`).

State: **`minn` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is an empty list, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0**
