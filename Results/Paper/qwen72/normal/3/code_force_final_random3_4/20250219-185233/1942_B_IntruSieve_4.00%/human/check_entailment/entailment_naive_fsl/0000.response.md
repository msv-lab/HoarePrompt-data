Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Specifically, the logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` and appending values to `mex` does not align with the problem description.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output is:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

However, the program will produce:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

This might seem correct, but let's consider a more complex input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The expected output is:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

But the program will produce:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

This output is incorrect because:
- For `a_3 = -2`, the program should append `4` to `mex` (since `p_3 = 4` and `MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`), but it appends `2` instead.

The program fails to correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for this input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
