The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`, and an array `a` of length `n` with elements in the range (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that at least one valid permutation `p` exists for the given `a`.
