Output State: **`minn` is `maxx + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `minn` (previously 0, 1, or 2), and possibly `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is updated to be `maxx + 1`.
- The value of `maxx` can be 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`.
- The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `mex`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
