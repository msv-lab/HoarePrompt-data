Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `minn` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is an empty list, `maxx` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`minn` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `maxx` is 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 0. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, `minn` is 1, `mex` contains 0, and `maxx` remains 0. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, `minn` is 0, `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if it is greater than `maxx` (which is 0), otherwise `maxx` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and possibly `minn` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `i` is 1. If `arr[i] > 0`, `minn` is updated to 1 or 2, and if `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1. If `arr[i] <= 0`, `mex` is updated to include `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and possibly `minn` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, and `i` is 2. If `arr[i] > 0` and `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i] > 0` and `minn` is not equal to `maxx`, `minn` remains 1, 2, or 3. If `arr[i] <= 0` and `abs(arr[2] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[2] - minn)` and `mex` includes the value `abs(arr[2] - minn)`. If `arr[i] <= 0` and `abs(arr[2] - minn)` is not greater than `maxx`, `maxx` remains unchanged and `mex` includes the value `abs(arr[2] - minn)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
