Output State: **`minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the value of `minn` before the iteration or the absolute difference between the corresponding element in `arr` and `minn`, `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`minn`**: After the loop finishes, `minn` will be the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` plus 1, or 0 if no positive integers are present in `arr`. This is because `minn` is incremented each time a positive integer is encountered, and if `minn` equals `maxx`, it is set to `maxx + 1`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.
- **`arr`**: The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is the input list of integers.
- **`mex`**: The list `mex` will contain the values appended during each iteration of the loop. If the element in `arr` is positive, `minn` is appended to `mex` and then `minn` is incremented. If the element in `arr` is non-positive, the absolute difference between the element and `minn` is appended to `mex`.
- **`maxx`**: The value of `maxx` will be the maximum value in the list `mex`, as `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the current `maxx` and the value appended to `mex` during each iteration.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop finishes, as the loop iterates from 0 to `n - 1`.
