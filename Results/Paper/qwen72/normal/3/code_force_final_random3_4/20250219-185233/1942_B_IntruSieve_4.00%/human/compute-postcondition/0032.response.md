Output State: **`minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and possibly `minn` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 2, and `mex` now includes the value `abs(arr[2] - minn)`.**
