Output State: **`minn` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and now also contains `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` remains either 0 or 1.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The list `mex` initially contains either 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`. After the code execution, `mex` now also contains the value `abs(arr[1] - minn)`.
- The value of `maxx` remains either 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
