You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each of the four integers p_i in the sequence is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: - The result of the formula for each test case is printed on a new line.
    #
    #### Detailed Calculation:
    #- For each integer \(x\) in the sequence:
    #  - If \(x\) is even, `x % 2` is 0, so the formula simplifies to:
    #    \[
    #    3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \right)
    #    \]
    #  - If \(x\) is odd, `x % 2` is 1, so the formula becomes:
    #    \[
    #    3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 1 \cdot (i < 3)
    #    \]
    #    - This means for \(i < 3\), an additional 1 is added to the sum if \(x\) is odd.
    #    - For \(i = 3\), no additional 1 is added.
    #
    #- The sum of these values for all four integers in the sequence is then divided by 3 using integer division.
    #
    #### Example Calculation:
    #- Suppose the input is:
    #  - `t = 2`
    #  - For the first test case: `p_0 = 4, p_1 = 5, p_2 = 6, p_3 = 7`
    #  - For the second test case: `p_0 = 0, p_1 = 1, p_2 = 2, p_3 = 3`
    #
    #- For the first test case:
    #  - \(p_0 = 4\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 2 + 0 = 6\)
    #  - \(p_1 = 5\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{5}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 1 = 3 \cdot 2 + 1 = 7\)
    #  - \(p_2 = 6\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{6}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 3 + 0 = 9\)
    #  - \(p_3 = 7\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{7}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 3 + 0 = 9\)
    #  - Sum: \(6 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 31\)
    #  - Result: \(31 // 3 = 10\)
    #
    #- For the second test case:
    #  - \(p_0 = 0\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 0 + 0 = 0\)
    #  - \(p_1 = 1\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 1 = 3 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1\)
    #  - \(p_2 = 2\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0 = 3\)
    #  - \(p_3 = 3\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0 = 3\)
    #  - Sum: \(0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7\)
    #  - Result: \(7 // 3 = 2\)
    #
    #### Final Output:
    #- The code will print the results of the formula for each test case, one result per line.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a sequence of four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200) from the input. It then calculates a value based on a formula that depends on whether each `p_i` is even or odd, and whether the index `i` is less than 3. The result of this formula for each test case is printed on a new line. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence. It then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.

The logic used in the program is:
1. For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), it calculates how many times Bob can win by removing pairs of that number (since removing pairs of numbers does not change the XOR result).
2. It also considers the case where there is an odd count of a number, and it adds an extra win for Bob if the number is 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 is 0 in XOR).

The formula used in the program:
```python
sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3
```
- `x // 2` calculates the number of pairs of a given number.
- `3 * (x // 2)` multiplies the number of pairs by 3 to account for the fact that each pair can be removed in three different ways (one of the three numbers 1, 2, or 3).
- `x % 2 * (i < 3)` adds an extra win if there is an odd count of a number and the number is 1, 2, or 3.
- The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the total number of wins for Bob.

This logic correctly handles all the edge cases and potential inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
