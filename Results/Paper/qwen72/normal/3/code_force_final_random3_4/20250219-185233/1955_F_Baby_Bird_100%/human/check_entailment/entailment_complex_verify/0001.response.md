### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by removing numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - The XOR of the sequence will be zero if the total number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s is even.
   - The XOR of the sequence will be non-zero if the total number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s is odd.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the total count of numbers becomes even as many times as possible.
   - Removing pairs of numbers (since \( x \oplus x = 0 \)) will help in achieving this goal.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing up the number of pairs of each type and adding the remaining single number if it exists and is one of the first three types (1, 2, or 3).

6. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - For each type \( i \) (where \( i \) is 0, 1, 2, or 3), the program calculates the number of pairs: \( 3 \times (x // 2) \).
   - It then adds the remaining single number if it exists and is one of the first three types: \( x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \).
   - The sum of these values is divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs and the remaining single number.
   - The division by 3 is used to count the number of times the total count becomes even.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - \( p_0 = 1 \), \( p_1 = 1 \), \( p_2 = 1 \), \( p_3 = 0 \)
  - Calculation:
    - \( 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
    - \( 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
    - \( 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
    - \( 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
  - Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3 \)
  - Result: \( 3 // 3 = 1 \)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - \( p_0 = 1 \), \( p_1 = 0 \), \( p_2 = 1 \), \( p_3 = 2 \)
  - Calculation:
    - \( 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
    - \( 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
    - \( 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
    - \( 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
  - Sum: \( 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5 \)
  - Result: \( 5 // 3 = 1 \)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - \( p_0 = 2 \), \( p_1 = 2 \), \( p_2 = 2 \), \( p_3 = 0 \)
  - Calculation:
    - \( 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
    - \( 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
    - \( 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
    - \( 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
  - Sum: \( 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9 \)
  - Result: \( 9 // 3 = 3 \)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - \( p_0 = 3 \), \( p_1 = 3 \), \( p_2 = 2 \), \( p_3 = 0 \)
  - Calculation:
    - \( 3 \times (3 // 2) + 3 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 3 \times 1 + 1 = 4 \)
    - \( 3 \times (3 // 2) + 3 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 3 \times 1 + 1 = 4 \)
    - \( 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
    - \( 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
  - Sum: \( 4 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 11 \)
  - Result: \( 11 // 3 = 3 \)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - \( p_0 = 0 \), \( p_1 = 9 \), \( p_2 = 9 \), \( p_3 = 9 \)
  - Calculation:
    - \( 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
    - \( 3 \times (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 3 \times 4 + 1 = 13 \)
    - \( 3 \times (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 3 \times 4 + 1 = 13 \)
    - \( 3 \times (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 3 \times 4 + 0 = 12 \)
  - Sum: \( 0 + 13 + 13 + 12 = 38 \)
  - Result: \( 38 // 3 = 12 \)
