### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by removing numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the total number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s is even, the XOR of the sequence will be zero, and Bob wins.
   - If the total number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s is odd, the XOR of the sequence will be non-zero, and Alice wins.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the total count of numbers becomes even as many times as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve should remove numbers in pairs (since removing two numbers of the same type will not change the parity of the total count).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing up the number of pairs of each type and adding the remaining single number if it exists and is one of the first three types (1, 2, or 3).

6. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - For each type \( i \) (where \( i \) is 0, 1, 2, or 3), the program calculates the number of pairs: \( 3 \times (x // 2) \).
   - It then adds the remaining single number if it exists and is one of the first three types: \( x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \).
   - The sum of these values is divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs and the remaining single number.
   - The division by 3 is used to count the number of times the total count becomes even.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy to maximize the number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **True**
