Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).**

Explanation: The variable `q` is assigned the value of 2 raised to the power of (`p` - 1). The value of `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix), and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which is even and not a power of 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
