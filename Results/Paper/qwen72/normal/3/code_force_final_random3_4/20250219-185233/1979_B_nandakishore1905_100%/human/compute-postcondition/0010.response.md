Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation:
- `p` is assigned the value of the length of `l`, which is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- `p` is now the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
