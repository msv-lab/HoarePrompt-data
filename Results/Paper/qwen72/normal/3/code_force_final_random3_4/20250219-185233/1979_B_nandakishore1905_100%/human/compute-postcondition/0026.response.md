Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `k - 6` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k - 6`, `f` is `k - 6`, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1).**

Explanation:
- `q` is updated to `2 ** (p - 1)`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `f`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `q` is calculated based on the length of the binary representation of `k - 6`, which is stored in `p`.
