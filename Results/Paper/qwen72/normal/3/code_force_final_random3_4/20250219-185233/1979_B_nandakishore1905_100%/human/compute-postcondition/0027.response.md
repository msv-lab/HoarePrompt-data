Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `k - 6` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k - 6`, `f` is `k - 8`, `q` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `f` is updated to `f - q`, which means `f` is now `k - 6 - 2` or `k - 8`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged.
