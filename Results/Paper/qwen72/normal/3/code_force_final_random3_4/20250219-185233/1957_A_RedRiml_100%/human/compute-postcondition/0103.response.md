Output State: **`d[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the second element of `palka`) is either set to 1 if it was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if it was already in `d`, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first element of `palka` and, if `i` was not previously in `pl`, now also contains the value `i` (the second element of `palka`), `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`.**
