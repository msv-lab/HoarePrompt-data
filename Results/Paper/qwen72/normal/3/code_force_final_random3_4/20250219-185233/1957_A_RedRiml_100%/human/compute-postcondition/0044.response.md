Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, for all integers in `palka` whose count is greater than or equal to 3.**
