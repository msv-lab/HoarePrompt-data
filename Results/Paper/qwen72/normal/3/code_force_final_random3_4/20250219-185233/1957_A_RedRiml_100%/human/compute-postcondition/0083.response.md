Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`.** 

The code snippet `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the `palka` list to be a list of integers input by the user. The length of this list must be `ln`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
