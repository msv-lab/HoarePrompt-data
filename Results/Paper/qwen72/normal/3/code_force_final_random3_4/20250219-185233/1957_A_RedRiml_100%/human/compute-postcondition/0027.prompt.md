Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the integer `i` if `i` was not in `pl` initially, and `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and the value 1 if `d.get(i) == None` initially, or the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and `d` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the integer `i` appended to it, and `d` has the key `i` with the value 1 if `d.get(i) == None` initially, or the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and `d` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `pl` and `d.get(i) == None` initially, `pl` now contains the integer `i` appended to it, and `d` has the key `i` with the value 1. If `i` was already in `pl` or `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially, `pl` remains unchanged, and the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
