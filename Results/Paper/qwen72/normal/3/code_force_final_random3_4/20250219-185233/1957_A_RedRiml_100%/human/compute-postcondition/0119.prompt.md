Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. `shapes` is 0. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is 0 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is `d[j] // 3`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`, `j` is the first element of `pl`, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is 0 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is the original value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`, `j` is the second element of `pl`, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element of `pl`, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is less than 3, `shapes` remains 0. If `d[j]` is 3 or more, `shapes` is the original value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`, and `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
