The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `palka`. For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `palka` when the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100
- `w` must be greater than 0
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers input by the user
- `pl` is an empty list
- `d` is an empty dictionary

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `palka` to ensure it has at least one integer, and `i` will be the first integer in `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary**
