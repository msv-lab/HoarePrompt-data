Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `w` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of elements, followed by a list of `ln` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of groups of three identical integers that can be formed from the list for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not modified by the function. **
