Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, for all integers in `palka` whose count is greater than or equal to 3.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100 for each test case.
- The variables `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain integers within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `w` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `ln` remains the input integer representing the length of the list `palka`.
- The list `palka` remains a list of integers input by the user, and it must have `ln` elements.
- The dictionary `d` now contains keys for each unique integer in `palka`, and the value for each key is the count of that integer in `palka`.
- The list `pl` now contains all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared in the list.
- The variable `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, but only for those integers whose count is greater than or equal to 3. This means `shapes` is calculated based on the final counts of integers in `d` that meet this criterion.
