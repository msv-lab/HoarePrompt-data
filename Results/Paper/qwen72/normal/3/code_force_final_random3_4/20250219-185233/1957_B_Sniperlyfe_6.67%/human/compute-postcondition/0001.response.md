The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and `nums` being a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 does not affect the loop's execution directly, but it is part of the initial state.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0**
