Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) except the last element which is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\).** 

In natural language, the list `nums` has `n` elements. All elements except the last one are set to a value calculated as \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The last element is set to the same value plus the original value of `k`.
