You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is now \(k - n \cdot (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\), and `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\).
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) except the last element which is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element, except the last, is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The last element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\). After the function concludes, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `nums` is a list of integers as described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for constructing the sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
   - The program initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates over the list and sets each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. This is done to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.
   - After setting each element, it subtracts the value from `k` to keep track of the remaining sum.
   - Finally, it adds the remaining `k` to the last element of the list to ensure that the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

3. **Bitwise OR Maximization**:
   - The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` generates a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), `k.bit_length()` is 3, and `(1 << 2) - 1` is `111` in binary, which is 7 in decimal.
   - By setting each element of the sequence to this value, the bitwise OR of the sequence will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`, which maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation.

4. **Sum Constraint**:
   - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by adding the remaining `k` to the last element of the list. This is a valid approach because the remaining `k` will be non-negative and will not affect the bitwise OR of the sequence.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly formats the results and prints them, ensuring that each test case's result is on a new line.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:
- **Overflow and Incorrect Sum**: If `k` is small and `n` is large, the expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` might result in a value that is too large to be assigned to each element of the sequence, leading to an incorrect sum. For example, if `k = 1` and `n = 10`, setting each element to `(1 << 0) - 1` (which is 0) and then adding `k` to the last element will not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the values assigned to the sequence do not exceed `k` and that the sum constraint is met correctly.

Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
            k -= nums[i]
        if k <= 0:
            break
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
```

This corrected program ensures that the values assigned to the sequence do not exceed `k` and that the sum constraint is met correctly.

Correctness: **False** (due to the potential issue with overflow and incorrect sum for large `n` and small `k`).

Correctness: **True** (after the correction).
