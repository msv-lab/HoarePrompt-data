Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is now \(k - n \cdot (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\), and `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) except the last element which is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- The value of `k` remains \(k - n \cdot (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\).
- The list `nums` is updated such that the last element (i.e., `nums[-1]`) is incremented by the current value of `k`. Therefore, the last element of `nums` is now \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\). All other elements in `nums` remain \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\).
