Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is now \(k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\), `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element (`nums[0]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), the second element (`nums[1]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), and the third element (`nums[2]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), all other elements initialized to 0.**
