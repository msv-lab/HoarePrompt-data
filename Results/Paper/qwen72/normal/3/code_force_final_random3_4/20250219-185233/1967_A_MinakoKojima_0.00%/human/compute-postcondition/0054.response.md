Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is equal to the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `ans` is equal to the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`.**
