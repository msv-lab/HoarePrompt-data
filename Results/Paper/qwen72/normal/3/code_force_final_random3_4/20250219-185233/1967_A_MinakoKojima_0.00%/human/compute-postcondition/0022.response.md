The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables change and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `a`, `m`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `m * (a[1] - a[0])`, `i` is 2**
