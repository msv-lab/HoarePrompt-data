The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables are affected by the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 3
- `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`, `i` is 3**
