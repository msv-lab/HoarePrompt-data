Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has run, `k` is now `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.**
