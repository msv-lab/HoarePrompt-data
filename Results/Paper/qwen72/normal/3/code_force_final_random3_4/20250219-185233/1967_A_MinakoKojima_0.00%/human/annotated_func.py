#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins available to buy new cards, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of each type i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        m = min(a)
        
        ans = 0
        
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the last provided input integers, `a` is the last provided input list of integers, `m` is the smallest integer in the last provided list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` of the number of cards of each type. It calculates and prints the maximum number of distinct types of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m` (where `m` is the minimum number of cards of any type), it prints the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, it updates the list `a` and calculates a specific product of differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a`, which it then prints. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the number of test cases `t`, the loop counter `_` which is `t-1`, the last provided `n` and `k`, the last provided list `a`, and the last calculated `ans`.
