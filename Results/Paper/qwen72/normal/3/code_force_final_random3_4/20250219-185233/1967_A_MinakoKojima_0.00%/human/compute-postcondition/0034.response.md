Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to the factorial of `n`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to the factorial of `n`, which is the product of all positive integers up to `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged.
