Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0 initially.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `a`.
- The initial values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
- `m` is still the smallest integer in the list `a`, but since `a` has been updated, `m` will be recalculated based on the new list `a`.
- `ans` remains 0 initially.
- The values of `t` and `_` are not affected by this code snippet.
