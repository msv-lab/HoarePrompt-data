Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 3**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by multiplying its current value with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
- Given `i` is 3, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` becomes `a[3] - a[2]`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
