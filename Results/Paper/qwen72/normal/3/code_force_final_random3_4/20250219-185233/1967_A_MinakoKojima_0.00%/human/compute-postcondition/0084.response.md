The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but based on the provided context, it operates on multiple test cases. Each test case includes the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of distinct types of cards.
  - `k`: An integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of coins available to buy new cards.
  - `a`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of each type i.

The function returns the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of distinct types of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` of the number of cards of each type. It returns the maximum number of distinct types of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins `k` for each test case.**
