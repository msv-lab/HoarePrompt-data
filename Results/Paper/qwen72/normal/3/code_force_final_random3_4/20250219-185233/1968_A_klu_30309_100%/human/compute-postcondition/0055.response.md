The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, and `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced this maximum `max_sum`.**
