Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, and `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced this maximum `max_sum`. The list `results` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `best_y`.**
