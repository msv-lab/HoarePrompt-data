The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element in `results` is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y` and `y` itself is maximized, for each `x` in the list `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`, and returns a list `results` of length `t`. Each element in `results` is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` itself, for each `x` in `test_cases`.**
