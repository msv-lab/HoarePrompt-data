Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, and `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced this maximum `max_sum`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a non-negative integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- **`test_cases`**: The list of integers remains unchanged, where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and the list has at least 2 elements.
- **`x`**: The second element in `test_cases`, which remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`results`**: Contains the final value of `best_y` after the loop completes.
- **`y`**: After the loop completes, `y` is 1, as the loop iterates from `x - 1` down to 1.
- **`gcd_val`**: The greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, which is always 1.
- **`current_sum`**: The sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, which is `1 + 1` = 2.
- **`max_sum`**: The maximum value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop. This value is updated whenever a new `current_sum` is greater than the current `max_sum`.
- **`best_y`**: The value of `y` that produced the maximum `max_sum`. If no `current_sum` is greater than the initial `max_sum` (which is 0), `best_y` remains 1. Otherwise, `best_y` is the `y` value that produced the highest `current_sum`.

The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to 1, checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and updating `max_sum` and `best_y` if the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` is greater than the current `max_sum`. The loop breaks as soon as this condition is met, ensuring that `best_y` is the largest `y` value that satisfies this condition. If no such `y` is found, `best_y` remains 1.
