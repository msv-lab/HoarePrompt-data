The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `x`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from `x - 1` down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, but it must still be greater than 0.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element
- `x` is the first element in `test_cases`
- `results` is an empty list
- `y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0
- `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`
- `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 1)`
- If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 1)` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables retain their original values.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` is now `x - 2`
- `y` must still be greater than 0, so `x - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 2)` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables retain their original values.**
