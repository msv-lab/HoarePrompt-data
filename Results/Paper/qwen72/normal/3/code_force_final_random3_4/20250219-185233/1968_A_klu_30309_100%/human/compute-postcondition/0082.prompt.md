Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1 (or the smallest value greater than 0 that the loop reaches), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + 1` if `current_sum` > `max_sum`, otherwise `max_sum` remains unchanged, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` > `max_sum`, otherwise `best_y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, and `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced this maximum `max_sum`. The list `results` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `best_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `best_y` is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that `gcd_val + y` is maximized, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop execution, and `y` is 1. `results` now contains one additional element, which is `best_y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
