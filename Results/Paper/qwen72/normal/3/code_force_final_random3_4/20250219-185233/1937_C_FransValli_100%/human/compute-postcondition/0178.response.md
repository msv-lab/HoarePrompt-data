Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. The list `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mini` is `arr[0]`.
   - `item` is 0.
   - `_` is the number of iterations, which is `n-1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string that starts with a question mark (`?`).
   - It will then print the value of `mini` twice.
   - It will then print the value of `item` twice.
   - The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
   - `item` is explicitly given as 0.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `? [mini] [mini] 0 0`.
   - Since `mini` is `arr[0]`, the exact value of `mini` depends on the values in `arr`, but it is the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] 0 0 (where mini is the first element of the list arr)**
