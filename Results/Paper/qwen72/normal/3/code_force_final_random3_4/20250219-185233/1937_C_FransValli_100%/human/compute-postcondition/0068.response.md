To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `maxi` is 0
- `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'
- `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists**
