Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string. If the new `res` is '<', `arr` is [2]. If the new `res` is '=', `arr` is [2]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1].** 

The value of `res` is updated to the new input string provided. The conditions for `arr` are still based on the value of `res`, so `arr` is [2] if `res` is '<' or '=', and [1] otherwise. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
