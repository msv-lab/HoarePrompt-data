Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order.
   - `item` is the last element in `arr`, which is `n-1`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`.
   - `res` is the input string.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.
   - `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is determined by the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `maxi` repeated twice, and the value of `i` repeated twice.
   - Since `i` is 2, the last two values will be 2.
   - The value of `maxi` depends on the input string `res`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` will be 1.
   - If `res` is not '<', `maxi` will be 0.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `res` is '<': `? 1 1 2 2`
- If `res` is not '<': `? 0 0 2 2`

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where maxi is 1 if res is '<', otherwise maxi is 0)**
