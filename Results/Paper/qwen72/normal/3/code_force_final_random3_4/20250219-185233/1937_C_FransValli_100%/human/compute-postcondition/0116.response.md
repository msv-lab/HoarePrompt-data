Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `mini` is 1, `item` is 1, `res` is '>'**

Explanation:
- The value of `mini` is updated to 1 because `item` is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, `item`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
