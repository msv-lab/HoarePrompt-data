Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `maxi` is determined based on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1.
     - If `res` is not '<', `maxi` remains 0.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `maxi` twice, then the value of `i` twice.
   - Since `i` is 2, the last two values will always be 2.
   - The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1.
     - If `res` is not '<', `maxi` is 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     ```python
     print('?', 1, 1, 2, 2, flush=True)
     ```
     Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
   - If `res` is not '<':
     ```python
     print('?', 0, 0, 2, 2, flush=True)
     ```
     Output: **? 0 0 2 2**

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided in the initial state, we need to consider both cases. However, the task requires us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where [maxi] is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise [maxi] is 0)**
