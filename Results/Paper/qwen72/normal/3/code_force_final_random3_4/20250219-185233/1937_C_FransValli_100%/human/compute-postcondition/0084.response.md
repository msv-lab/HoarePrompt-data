Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will have iterated from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be `n-1`.
- **`maxi`**: `maxi` is updated to the value of `i` whenever `res` is '<'. Thus, `maxi` will be the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
- **`arr`**: The list `arr` is not directly modified in the loop. However, it is described as containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'. This means `arr` will contain the relevant values of `i` based on the comparison results.
- **`mini`**: `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. This is consistent with the initial description and does not change during the loop execution.
