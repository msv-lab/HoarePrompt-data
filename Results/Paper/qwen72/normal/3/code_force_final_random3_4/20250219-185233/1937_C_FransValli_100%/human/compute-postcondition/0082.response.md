Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'. `res` is the input string. `maxi` is 3, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**

Explanation: The value of `maxi` is updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `res`, and `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
