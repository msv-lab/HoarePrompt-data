Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order.
   - `item` is `n-1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Variable Analysis:**
   - `mini` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, it is likely that `mini` is the smallest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution. Since `maxi` is the largest such integer, `mini` would be the smallest such integer.
   - `item` is `n-1`, which is the last element in the list `arr`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement starts with the string `?`.
   - `mini` is the smallest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `item` is `n-1`.

Since `mini` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of the loop execution. However, the values of `item` and the string `?` are clear.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [n-1] [n-1] (where [mini] is the smallest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, and [n-1] is the last element in the list `arr`)**
