Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'. `maxi` is 2. `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. `res` is an input string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `maxi` is updated to 2, as `i` is 2.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `mini`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
