Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2, 3]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3] and `maxi` is 0. If `res` is not '<' or '=', then `arr` is [0, 1, 3] if `res` is not '=', otherwise `arr` remains [0, 1, 2] and `maxi` remains 0.**
