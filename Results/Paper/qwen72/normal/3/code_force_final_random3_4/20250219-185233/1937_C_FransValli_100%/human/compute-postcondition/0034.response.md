Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is [2], `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = [i]` updates the value of `arr` to a list containing the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `arr` while keeping the rest of the variables the same.
