Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is `arr[0]`, `item` is 0, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mini` is updated to be the first element of the list `arr`, which is `arr[0]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, `item`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
