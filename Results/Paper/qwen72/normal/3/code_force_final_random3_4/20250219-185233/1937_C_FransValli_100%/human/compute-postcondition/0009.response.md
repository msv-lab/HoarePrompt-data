The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2) and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.**
