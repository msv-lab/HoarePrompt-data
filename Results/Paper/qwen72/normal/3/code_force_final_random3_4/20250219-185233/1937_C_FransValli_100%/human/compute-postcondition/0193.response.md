Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>', `item` is the last element in `arr`, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the final input string. If `res` is not '>', `mini` remains the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>'.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: This remains the input integer, unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`i`**: This remains `n-1`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`maxi`**: This is still the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', and it does not change within the loop.
- **`arr`**: This list remains unchanged, containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
- **`mini`**: After the loop finishes, `mini` is the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>'. If `res` is never '>', then `mini` remains the initial value, which is 0.
- **`item`**: This is the last element in `arr` that was processed by the loop.
- **`_`**: This is the number of iterations, which is `n-1` and remains unchanged.
- **`res`**: This is the final input string received after the last iteration of the loop. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is updated to the last `item` in `arr`. If `res` is not '>', `mini` remains the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>'.
