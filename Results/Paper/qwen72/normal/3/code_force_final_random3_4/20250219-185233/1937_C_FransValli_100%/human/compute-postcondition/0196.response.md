The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates in an environment where it can interact with a sequence of test cases, each involving an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), and a hidden permutation `p` which is a list of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can ask up to 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of elements in the permutation. The function must eventually output a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an environment with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1 for each test case, where `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). It can ask up to 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of elements in `p`. The function returns a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized.**
