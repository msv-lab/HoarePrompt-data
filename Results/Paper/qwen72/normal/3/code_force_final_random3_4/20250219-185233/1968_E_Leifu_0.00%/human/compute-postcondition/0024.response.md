Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `j` is 4.

The print statement is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down the execution of this statement:

1. `str(j)` converts the integer `j` to a string. Since `j` is 4, `str(j)` will be `'4'`.
2. The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings. So, `'4' + ' ' + '4'` will result in the string `'4 4'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **4 4**
