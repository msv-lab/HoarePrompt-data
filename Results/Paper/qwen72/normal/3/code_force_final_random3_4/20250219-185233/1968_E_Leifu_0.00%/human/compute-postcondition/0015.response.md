Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`**

**Natural Language Explanation**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an input integer within the range of 1 to 50, and `i` remains 0. The variable `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4, as this was a condition for the loop to start. The variable `j` will have the value of `n`, as the loop iterates from 4 to `n` inclusive, and `j` will be at its final value, which is `n`, when the loop ends.
