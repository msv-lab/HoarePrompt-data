Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n` + 1**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have the value `n` + 1, because the loop starts at `j = 4` and increments `j` by 1 for each iteration until `j` reaches `n + 1`, at which point the loop condition `j <= n` becomes false and the loop terminates. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
