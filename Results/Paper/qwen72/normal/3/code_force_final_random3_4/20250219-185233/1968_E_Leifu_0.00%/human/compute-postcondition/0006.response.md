The `print('2 3')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'2 3'`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, and `n` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables. The string `'2 3'` is printed directly.

Output: **2 3**
