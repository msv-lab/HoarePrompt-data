The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 4, because the range starts from 4 and goes up to `n + 1`. The variable `j` will start at 4 on the first iteration.

Given that `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 3, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
