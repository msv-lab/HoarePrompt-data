Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The list `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump`. The list `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None` or to the rank of the last non-trump card of that suit encountered, if any.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump` except the last one, `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'` where `{rank}` and `{suit}` are the rank and suit of a non-trump card, and `{trumps.pop()}` is the last rank in the `trumps` list. `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. If `rank` is `None`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Additionally, `trumps` is not an empty list, meaning there is at least one card with the same suit as the `trump`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. If `trumps` is not an empty list, and if `rank` is `None`, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump` except the last one, `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `suits` must have at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`, `suit` is the next suit in the `suits` dictionary, `rank` is the next rank in the `suits` dictionary, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `rank` is not `None`, the program state remains as described in the precondition. If `trumps` is an empty list, the program returns nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. If `trumps` is not empty, `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `trumps` has one less element, `suits` must have at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`, `suit` is the next suit in the `suits` dictionary, and `rank` is the next rank in the `suits` dictionary. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
