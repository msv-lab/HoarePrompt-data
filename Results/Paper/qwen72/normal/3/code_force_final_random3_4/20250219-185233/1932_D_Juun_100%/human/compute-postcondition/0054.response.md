To determine what will be printed by the `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement, let's analyze the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
   - If `rank` is `None`:
     - `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump` except the last one.
     - `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.
     - `suits` must have at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`.
     - `suit` is the next suit in the `suits` dictionary.
     - `rank` is the next rank in the `suits` dictionary.
     - The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - Otherwise, the state remains as described in the precondition.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement is executed.
   - This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state; it simply prints the string 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement will always print the string 'IMPOSSIBLE' regardless of the values of `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `rank`, `trumps`, `answers`, or `suits`.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
