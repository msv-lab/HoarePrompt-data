Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. If `rank` is `None`, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump` except the last one, `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `suits` must have at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`, `suit` is the next suit in the `suits` dictionary, `rank` is the next rank in the `suits` dictionary, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `rank` is not `None`, the program state remains as described in the precondition.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. If `rank` is `None`, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, and a new string is added to the `answers` list in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. The `trumps` list now contains all the ranks of the cards with the same suit as `trump` except the last one. The `suits` dictionary still has at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`, and `suit` and `rank` are updated to the next suit and rank in the `suits` dictionary, respectively. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `rank` is not `None`, the program state remains as described in the initial state.
