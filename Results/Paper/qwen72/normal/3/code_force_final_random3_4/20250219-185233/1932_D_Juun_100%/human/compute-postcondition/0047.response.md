The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`. The initial state describes a complex scenario involving variables and objects such as `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `rank`, `trump`, `trumps`, `answers`, and `suits`. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or objects; it simply prints a constant string.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
- If `rank` is `None`, `trump` is assigned the value of user input.
- `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump` except the last one.
- `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.
- `suits` must have at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`.
- `suit` is the next suit in the `suits` dictionary.
- `rank` is the next rank in the `suits` dictionary.
- If `rank` is not `None`, the program state remains as described in the precondition.

The `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement will execute regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state. The output will always be the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
