Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is now an empty list. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variables `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` are unchanged from their initial values.
- The variable `trump` still holds the value of the user input.
- The list `trumps` is now empty because all the trump cards have been popped out during the loop's execution.
- The list `answers` contains all the pairs of non-trump cards that were processed, with each pair formatted as a string where the ranks are sorted and the suit is appended to each rank.
- The dictionary `suits` retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered during the loop's execution, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.
