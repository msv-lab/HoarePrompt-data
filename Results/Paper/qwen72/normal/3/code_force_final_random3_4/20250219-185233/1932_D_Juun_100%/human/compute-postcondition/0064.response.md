Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
- `trump` is assigned the value of user input.
- `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element.
- `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element.
- Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`.
- The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`trumps` List**: This list is sorted in descending order and contains at least one element. Therefore, `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the largest element in the list, and the second `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the next largest element.
2. **`trump` Variable**: This variable holds the value of the user input, which is the trump suit.
3. **Formatted String**: The `print` statement will format the string by concatenating the largest and second largest elements from `trumps` with the trump suit.

### Output Calculation:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return the largest element in `trumps`.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return the second largest element in `trumps`.
- Both elements will be concatenated with the trump suit.

### Example:
- Suppose `trumps` is `[10, 8, 6]` and `trump` is `'H'` (Hearts).
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return `10`, and `trumps` will become `[8, 6]`.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return `8`, and `trumps` will become `[6]`.
- The `print` statement will output: `10H 8H`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[largest element in trumps][trump] [second largest element in trumps][trump] (where [largest element in trumps] and [second largest element in trumps] are the largest and second largest elements in the sorted `trumps` list, and [trump] is the user input trump suit)**
