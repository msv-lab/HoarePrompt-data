Postcondition: **The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The list `trumps` is an empty list. The list `answers` is either an empty list or contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, and appending the `suit` to each element. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`, except for the key `suit` which is either `None` or set to `rank`. The variable `rank` is assigned the rank of the first card from the input, and the variable `suit` is assigned the suit of the first card from the input. The suit of the first card is not equal to the trump suit.**
