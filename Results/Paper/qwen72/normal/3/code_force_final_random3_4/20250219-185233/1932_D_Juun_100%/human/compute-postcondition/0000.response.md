Output State: **The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The program waits for user input, but no specific variable is updated with this input.**

Explanation: The `input()` function is called, which waits for user input. However, the input is not assigned to any variable, so the initial state of the function parameters remains unchanged. The program is now in a state where it is waiting for the user to provide input.
