Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump` except the last one, `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'` where `{rank}` and `{suit}` are the rank and suit of a non-trump card, and `{trumps.pop()}` is the last rank in the `trumps` list. `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. If `rank` is `None`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Additionally, `trumps` is not an empty list, meaning there is at least one card with the same suit as the `trump`.**
