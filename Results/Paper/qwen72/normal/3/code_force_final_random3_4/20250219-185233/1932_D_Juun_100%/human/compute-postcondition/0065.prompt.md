Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is now a sorted list in descending order, meaning all the cards with the same suit as the `trump` have been popped out and sorted. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit. If `trumps` becomes empty before all non-trump cards are processed, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and return, leaving some non-trump cards unpaired.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is now a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is now a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is now a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
