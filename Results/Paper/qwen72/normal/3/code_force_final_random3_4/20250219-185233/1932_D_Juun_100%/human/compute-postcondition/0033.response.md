Output State: **The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The list `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump`. The list `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None` or to the rank of the last non-trump card of that suit encountered, if any.**

In natural language, this means:
- The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` are not modified by the loop.
- The variable `trump` holds the suit specified by the user.
- The list `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the same suit as the `trump`.
- The list `answers` will contain a string for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit that were encountered, where each string is the result of sorting the ranks of the pair, joining them with a space, and appending the suit to each element.
- The dictionary `suits` will have keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each set to `None` or to the rank of the last non-trump card of that suit encountered, if any.
