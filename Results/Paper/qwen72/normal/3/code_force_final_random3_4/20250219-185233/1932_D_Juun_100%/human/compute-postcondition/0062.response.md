To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
2. `trump` is assigned the value of user input.
3. `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element.
4. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element.
5. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`.
6. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`trumps` List**: This list is sorted in descending order and contains at least one element. Since it must contain at least one element, it will also contain at least two elements for the `pop` operations to work without error.
2. **`trump` Variable**: This variable is assigned the value of user input. We don't know the exact value of `trump`, but it is a string representing the trump suit.
3. **`trumps.pop()`**: This operation removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list. Since `trumps` is sorted in descending order, the first `pop` will return the highest rank in the list.
4. **`trumps.pop()` (second call)**: This operation removes and returns the new last element of the `trumps` list, which is the second highest rank in the list.

### Output Calculation:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return the highest rank in the `trumps` list.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return the second highest rank in the `trumps` list.
- Both ranks will be concatenated with the `trump` suit.

### Example:
- Suppose `trumps` is `[10, 9, 8]` and `trump` is `'H'` (Hearts).
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return `8` and `trumps` will become `[10, 9]`.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return `9` and `trumps` will become `[10]`.

The `print` statement will then output:
```
8H 9H
```

### General Case:
- The highest rank in `trumps` will be the first part of the output.
- The second highest rank in `trumps` will be the second part of the output.
- Both ranks will be concatenated with the `trump` suit.

### Final Output:
Output: **[highest_rank]trump [second_highest_rank]trump (where [highest_rank] and [second_highest_rank] are the highest and second highest ranks in the `trumps` list, and `trump` is the user-input trump suit)**
