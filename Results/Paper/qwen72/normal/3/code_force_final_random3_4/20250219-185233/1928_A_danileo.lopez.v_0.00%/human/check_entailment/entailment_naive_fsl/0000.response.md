Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it incorrectly determines that a rectangle of size 1 \times 3 cannot form another rectangle, when in fact it can. According to the problem description, a 1 \times 3 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times 1 and one 1 \times 2 rectangle, and these can be rearranged to form a 2 \times 2 rectangle, which is different from the original 1 \times 3 rectangle. However, the program will output "No" for this case because neither 1 nor 3 is even, which is incorrect.

Example Input:
```
1
1 3
```
Expected Output:
```
Yes
```
Actual Output:
```
No
```

This shows that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and hence it is incorrect.
