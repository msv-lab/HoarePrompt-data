Reasoning:  
The logic of the program is based on the observation that a rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides if at least one of its dimensions (a or b) is even. This is because an even dimension can be divided into two equal parts, each of which is an integer. When one of the dimensions is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, then no such cut can be made that results in two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and thus, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form another rectangle. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot form another rectangle.

This logic aligns with the problem description and the examples provided. For instance:
- For the input `1 1`, both dimensions are odd, so the output is 'No'.
- For the input `2 1`, one dimension is even, so the output is 'No' (but this is a special case where the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different one).
- For the input `2 6`, one dimension is even, so the output is 'Yes'.
- For the input `3 2`, one dimension is even, so the output is 'Yes'.
- For the input `2 2`, one dimension is even, so the output is 'Yes'.
- For the input `2 4`, one dimension is even, so the output is 'Yes'.
- For the input `6 3`, one dimension is even, so the output is 'No' (but this is a special case where the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different one).

However, the special case where both dimensions are 1 (i.e., `1 1`) is correctly handled by the program, as it will print 'No'. The program also correctly handles cases where one dimension is 1 and the other is even (e.g., `2 1`), as it will print 'No' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different one.

Given the problem description and the examples, the program's logic is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
