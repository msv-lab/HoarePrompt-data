Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function prints 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd. The function does not return any value, and the final state of the program is that it has printed the results for all `t` test cases. **
