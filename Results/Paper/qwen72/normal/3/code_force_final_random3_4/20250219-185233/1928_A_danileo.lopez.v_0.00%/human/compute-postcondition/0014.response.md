Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding whether `a` or `b` is even or odd are not evaluated by this code snippet, so the output state only reflects the updated values of `a` and `b` based on the user input.
