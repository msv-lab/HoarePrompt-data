Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then reassemble them into a different rectangle (considering rotations as the same). The key insight is that if either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and reassemble them into a different rectangle. This is because:

1. If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles and then reassemble them into a \( b \times a \) rectangle, which is different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.
2. If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles and then reassemble them into a \( b \times a \) rectangle, which is different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.

If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then no matter how Bob cuts the rectangle, he will always end up with two smaller rectangles that can only be reassembled into the same \( a \times b \) rectangle or its rotation, which is considered the same.

The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:`. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This logic aligns with the problem's requirements.

The program also correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterating \(t\) times, reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the given logic.

Correctness: **True**
