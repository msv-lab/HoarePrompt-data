You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function prints 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd. The function does not return any value, and the final state of the program is that it has printed the results for all `t` test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He wants to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle must be different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle in terms of its dimensions (considering rotations).

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - To form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) must be even. This is because:
     - If \( a \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
     - If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle with dimensions \( 2 \times \frac{a \cdot b}{2} \) or \( \frac{a \cdot b}{2} \times 2 \), which will be different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.

3. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether at least one of the dimensions is even.
   - If either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd dimension will result in non-integer dimensions, and the only possible cuts will result in rectangles that are the same as the original when considering rotations.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( a \) and \( b \) are both 1 (which is the smallest possible rectangle and cannot be cut).
   - It also handles the case where \( a \) or \( b \) is 2, which is the smallest even dimension and can be cut to form a new rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
