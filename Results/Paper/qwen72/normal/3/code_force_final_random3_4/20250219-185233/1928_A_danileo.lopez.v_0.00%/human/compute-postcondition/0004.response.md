The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. The initial state describes that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `_` is 0, and `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, with the condition that either `a` is even or `b` is even.

Given this initial state, the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string 'Yes' regardless of their values.

Output: **Yes**
