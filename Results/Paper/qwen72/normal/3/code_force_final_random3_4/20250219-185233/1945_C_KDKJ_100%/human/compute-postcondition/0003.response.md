Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1
```
func_1()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The function `func_1()` is called, but we do not have information about what `func_1()` does. Therefore, we cannot determine if it changes any variables or returns any values. The only information we have is that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 1. Since we don't know the implementation of `func_1()`, we assume it does not affect the initial state.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1**
