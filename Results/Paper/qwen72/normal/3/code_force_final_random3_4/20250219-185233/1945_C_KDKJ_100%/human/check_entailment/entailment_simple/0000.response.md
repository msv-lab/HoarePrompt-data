### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` in `func_2`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`, which reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Cumulative Count Calculation**:
   - In `func_1`, the program initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and updates the cumulative counts in `S`. For each character `s` in `a`:
     - If `s` is '0', it increments the count of '0's.
     - If `s` is '1', it increments the count of '1's.
   - After processing the string, `S` contains `n + 1` sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to the i-th house.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to -1, which will store the optimal position of the road.
   - It iterates through all possible positions `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each position `i`:
     - It calculates the number of '0's on the left side (`left`) and the total number of houses on the left side (`lsum`).
     - It calculates the number of '1's on the right side (`right`) and the total number of houses on the right side (`rsum`).
     - It checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied.
     - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the position `i` if `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the current `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible positions, the program prints the optimal position `ans`.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Test Case**: The program correctly processes a single test case.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position of the road.
- The conditions and the logic to minimize the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` are correctly applied.
- The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
