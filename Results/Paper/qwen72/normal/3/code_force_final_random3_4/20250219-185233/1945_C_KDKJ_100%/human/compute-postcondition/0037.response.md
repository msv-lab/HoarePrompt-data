The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the first sublist in `S`, `rsum` is `n`, `ans` is either -1 or 0**.
