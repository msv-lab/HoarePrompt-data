Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a string `a`. It then processes the string `a` to find an index `i` (0 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`) that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, while ensuring that the cumulative count of '0's in the first `i` characters is at least half of `i`, and the cumulative count of non-'0's in the remaining characters is at least half of the remaining length. If no such index exists, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the found index. **
