Output State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[1]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[1]`, `rsum` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
