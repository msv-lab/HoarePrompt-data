Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the first sublist in `S`, `rsum` is `n`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either -1 or 0, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is updated to 0. If not, `ans` remains -1.***
