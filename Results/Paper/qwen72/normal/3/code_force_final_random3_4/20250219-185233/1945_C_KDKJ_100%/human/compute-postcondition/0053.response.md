Postcondition: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[2]`, `lsum` is 2, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[2]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2. If the absolute value of `n / 2 - i` is less than the absolute value of `n / 2 - ans`, then `ans` is set to 2.**
