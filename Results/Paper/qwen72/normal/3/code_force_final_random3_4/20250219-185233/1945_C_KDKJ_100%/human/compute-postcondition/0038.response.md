Output State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[1]`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the first sublist in `S`, `rsum` is `n`, `ans` is either -1 or 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `left = S[i][0]` updates the value of `left` to be the first element of the sublist `S[1]` (since `i` is 1).
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state information that is still valid is included in the output state.
