Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer value input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and non-'0's (respectively) in the string `a` up to that point, `ans` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = i
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - i
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the first sublist in `S`, `rsum` is `n`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either -1 or 0, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is updated to 0. If not, `ans` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[1]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[1]`, `rsum` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is either -1, 0, or 1. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1. If `abs(n / 2 - i) >= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains either -1 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[2]`, `lsum` is 2, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[2]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute value of `n / 2 - i` is less than the absolute value of `n / 2 - ans`, then `ans` is set to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
