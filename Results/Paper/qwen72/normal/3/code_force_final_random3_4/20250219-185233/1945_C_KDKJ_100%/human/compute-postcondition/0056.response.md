To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters.
   - `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists.
   - `ans` is the index `i` (0 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`) that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`. If no such index exists, `ans` remains -1.

2. **Understanding the Conditions:**
   - `ans` is determined by finding an index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`.
   - The index `i` must also satisfy the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.

3. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `left` and `right` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they are likely to be derived from the sublists in `S`.
   - `lsum` and `rsum` are also not explicitly defined, but they are likely to be the sums of some elements in the sublists of `S`.

4. **Possible Values for `ans`:**
   - If no index `i` satisfies the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, `ans` will be -1.
   - If there is an index `i` that satisfies the conditions, `ans` will be the index that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the exact values of `left`, `right`, `lsum`, and `rsum` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, based on the conditions, `ans` will either be -1 if no valid index is found, or it will be the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the given conditions.

Given this information, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the index i (0 ≤ i ≤ n) that minimizes the absolute difference between n / 2 and i while satisfying the conditions left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum, or -1 if no such index exists)**
