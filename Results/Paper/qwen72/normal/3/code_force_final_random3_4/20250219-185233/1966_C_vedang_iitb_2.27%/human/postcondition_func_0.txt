The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a sorted list `a_new` of unique elements from `a`. Each element at index i (1 â‰¤ i < len(a_new)) in `a_new` is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1 in the original sorted list of unique elements. The final state of the program is that `a` remains unchanged, and `a_new` is the modified list as described.
