Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the second integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to the second element of `nums`; otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1, num)`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = nums[i]` updates the value of `num` to the second integer in the list `nums` because `i` is 1.
- The initial state specifies that `num` was the first integer in the list `nums`. After the execution, `num` is now the second integer in the list.
- The condition for `arr` being empty or containing the tuple `(1, 1, num)` is now based on whether the first element of `nums` is equal to the second element of `nums`.
- All other variables (`N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, and `nums`) remain unchanged or retain their initial conditions.
