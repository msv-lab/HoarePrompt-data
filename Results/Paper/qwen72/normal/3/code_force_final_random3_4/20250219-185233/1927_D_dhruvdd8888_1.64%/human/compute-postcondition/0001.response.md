The value of `N` is assigned the integer value read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`. The function `func_1` is still expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout, and the input format and constraints remain unchanged. The input variable now holds the function `sys.stdin.readline` which reads a line from standard input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer read from the standard input, `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout, the input consists of multiple test cases with the same format and constraints, and `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`.**
