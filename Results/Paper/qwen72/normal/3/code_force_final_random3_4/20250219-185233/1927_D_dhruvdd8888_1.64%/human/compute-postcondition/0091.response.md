The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input (stdin), where each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array `a`. The next line contains an integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the following `q` lines contains two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The function processes these inputs and writes the results to standard output (stdout).

For each query, the function returns the result of some operation (not specified) performed on the subarray `a[l:r]`.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it returns the result of an operation performed on a subarray of `a` and writes the results to standard output.**
