Output State: **`N` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the second integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2, num)`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a new tuple to the list `arr`.
- The tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` is calculated as `(1 + 0, 2, num)`, which simplifies to `(1, 2, num)`.
- Therefore, `arr` now contains the tuple `(1, 2, num)`.
- All other variables (`N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
