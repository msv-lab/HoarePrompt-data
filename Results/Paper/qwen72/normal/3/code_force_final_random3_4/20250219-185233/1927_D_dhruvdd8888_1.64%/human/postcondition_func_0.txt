The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. For each query, the function determines and prints a pair of indices that represent the boundaries of a segment in `a` or prints `(-1, -1)` if no such segment exists. The function processes each query independently and writes the results to standard output. After processing all queries, the function terminates.
