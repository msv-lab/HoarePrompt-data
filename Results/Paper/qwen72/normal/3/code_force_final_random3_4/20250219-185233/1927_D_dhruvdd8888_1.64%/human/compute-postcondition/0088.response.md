Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are updated to the new input integers, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, `tc > 5`, `ppp` is either 23 or not 23, and `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `e >= r`, the postconditions of the if part apply. If `e < r` and `e < N`, the postconditions of the if part apply. Otherwise, if `e < r` and `e >= N`, the postconditions of the else part apply.***
