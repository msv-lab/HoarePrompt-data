Postcondition: **The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user. If `tc` is greater than 5, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `ppp` is equal to 23, the postcondition remains unchanged. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `s` is greater than `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `l`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. If `e` is less than `r`, then `e` is less than `N` if `e` is less than `N`, or `e` is greater than or equal to `N` if `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.**
