Postcondition: **The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user, `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order, `tc > 5`, `ppp` is either 23 or not 23. If `e` is less than `N`, the values of `s` and `e` remain the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, the values of `s` and `e` also remain the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.**
