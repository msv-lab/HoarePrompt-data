Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it, and the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `s = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `s`. Since `i` was already 0, `s` remains 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
