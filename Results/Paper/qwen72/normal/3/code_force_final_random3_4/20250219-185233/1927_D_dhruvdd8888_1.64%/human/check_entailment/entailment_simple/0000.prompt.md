Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the array a, followed by n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the following q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: The input integer for the loop is 0 (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `l` and `r` are the last set of integers provided by the user, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `tc > 5`, the loop has continued to the next iteration for all iterations where this condition was true. If `ppp` is 23, the loop has printed `l` and `r` for all iterations where `tc > 5` and `ppp` is 23. The values of `s` and `e` have been updated based on the conditions within the loop for each iteration.
