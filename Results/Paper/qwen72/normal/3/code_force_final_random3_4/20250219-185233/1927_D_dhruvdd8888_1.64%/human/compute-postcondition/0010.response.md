Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it, and the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is an empty list.
- The code `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` adds a tuple to `arr`.
- The tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` is calculated as `(1 + 0, 0, num)` which simplifies to `(1, 0, num)`.
- Therefore, `arr` now contains the tuple `(1, 0, num)`.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial state.
