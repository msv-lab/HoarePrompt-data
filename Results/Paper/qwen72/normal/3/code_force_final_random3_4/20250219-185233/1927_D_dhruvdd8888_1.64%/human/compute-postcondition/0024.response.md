Output State: **`N` is the input integer, `i` is `N`, `s` is the index of the last occurrence of the last unique number in `nums` before `-1`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last integer in the list `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` and the value of the segment, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `N` remains the same as the input integer.
- The variable `i` is equal to `N`, indicating the loop has completed its iterations.
- The variable `s` is set to the index of the last occurrence of the last unique number in `nums` before the `-1` was appended.
- The variable `e` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `num` is the last integer in the list `nums`, which is `-1`.
- The variable `arr` contains a list of tuples. Each tuple in `arr` represents a segment in `nums` where the first element of the tuple is the start index of the segment, the second element is the end index of the segment, and the third element is the value of the segment. These segments are identified based on changes in the value of `num` as the loop iterates through `nums`.
- The list `nums` remains the same as it was read from the input, with `-1` appended to it.
