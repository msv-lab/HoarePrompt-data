Output State: **`N` is an integer read from the standard input, `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout, the input consists of multiple test cases with the same format and constraints, `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, `s` is 0, `e` is 0.**

The variable `e` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. The initial state remains the same with the addition of the variable `e` being set to 0.
