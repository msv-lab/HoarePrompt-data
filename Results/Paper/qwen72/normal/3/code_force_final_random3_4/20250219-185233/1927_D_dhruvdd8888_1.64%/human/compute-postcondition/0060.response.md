The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the flow of the loop.

Output State: **The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user, `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `ppp == 23`, and `s` is greater than `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `l`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. If `e` is less than `r`, then `e` is less than `N` if `e` is less than `N`, or `e` is greater than or equal to `N` if `e` is greater than or equal to `N`. If `ppp` is not 23, the values of `s` and `e` remain unchanged. The loop will skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration.**
