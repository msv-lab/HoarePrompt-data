Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 1, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1, num)`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- `s` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, and `nums` remain unchanged from the initial state.
