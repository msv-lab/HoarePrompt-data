Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user.
   - If `tc` is greater than 5, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If `ppp` is equal to 23, the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - The current value of `s` is greater than `l`.
   - The value of `s` is not equal to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - The current value of `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1.
   - The print statement will output the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1, `s - 1` will be a value that is one less than `s`.
   - The exact value of `s` is not provided, but we know it is greater than `l` and not equal to 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `s - 1` followed by the value of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, and s is greater than `l` and not equal to 1)**
