### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called, which is responsible for reading the input for that test case and processing the queries.

2. **Array Segmentation:**
   - Inside `func_1`, the program reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to ensure the loop processes the last segment correctly.
   - The program then iterates over the array to segment it into contiguous segments of the same value. Each segment is represented as a tuple `(start, end, value)` and stored in the list `arr`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` where the segment starting at `l` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - The program then checks the segment boundaries to determine if a pair of different elements exists within the query range:
     - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1. If so, it prints `(-1, -1)` because there is no valid index before 1. Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)` because the segment extends beyond the query range.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

4. **Edge Cases and Conditions:**
   - The program includes a condition `if tc > 5` to skip printing for test cases beyond the first 5. This is not a mandatory requirement but is used for debugging or testing purposes.
   - The condition `if ppp == 23` is also used for debugging or testing and prints the array `nums` and the query `(l, r)` for the 23rd test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Segmentation Logic:**
  - The segmentation logic correctly identifies contiguous segments of the same value and stores them in `arr`.
  - However, the logic for determining the start and end indices of the segments is flawed. The program only checks the first segment that starts at or after `l` and the last segment that ends at or before `r`. This does not guarantee that the program will find a valid pair of different elements within the query range.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment starting at or after `l`.
  - The conditions for checking the segment boundaries are not comprehensive. For example, if the segment starting at `l` is the same as the segment ending at `r`, the program may incorrectly print `(-1, -1)` even if there are different elements within the query range.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program does not correctly handle all possible query ranges. It may miss valid pairs of different elements or incorrectly report that no such pairs exist.
  - The logic for determining the start and end indices of the segments is too simplistic and does not account for all possible scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical flaws in how it segments the array and processes the queries, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.
