The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of the variables `l` and `r`, which are integers provided by the user. Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified in the precondition, we can only describe them as user-provided integers.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are integers provided by the user)**
