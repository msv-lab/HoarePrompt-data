The code snippet `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `num`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` will be assigned the value of `nums[2]`. The initial state specifies that `num` is the second integer in the list `nums`, but after this assignment, `num` is now the third integer in the list `nums` (since `i` is 2).

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list `nums` still contains integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it. The variables `s` and `e` are still 0, and `arr` is still determined by the condition that if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is 2 and `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2, num)`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the third integer in the list `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is 2 and `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2, num)`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list.**
