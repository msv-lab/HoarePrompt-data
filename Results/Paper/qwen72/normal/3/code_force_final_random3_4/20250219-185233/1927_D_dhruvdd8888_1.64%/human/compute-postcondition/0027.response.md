To determine what will be printed by the `print(nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **N**: This is an input integer.
2. **i**: This is set to `N`.
3. **s**: This is the index of the last occurrence of the last unique number in `nums` before `-1`.
4. **e**: This is set to 0.
5. **num**: This is the last integer in the list `nums`, which is `-1`.
6. **arr**: This is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` and the value of the segment.
7. **LA**: This is `len(arr) - 1`.
8. **nums**: This is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.
9. **ppp**: This is set to 23.

Given these initial conditions, the `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums` as it is described in the initial state. Specifically, `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input, with `-1` appended to it.

Since the exact input line is not provided, we can only describe the structure of `nums`:

- `nums` will contain a sequence of integers followed by `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(nums)` statement will be:

Output: **[list of integers read from the next line of input, followed by -1]**
