Output State: **`l` and `r` are updated to the new input integers, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, `tc > 5`, and `ppp` is either 23 or not 23. If `ppp` is 23, the postconditions for `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, and `tc` remain as stated. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**
