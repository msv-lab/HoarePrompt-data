Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first value printed is the string `'?'`.
   - The next two values printed are `mak`. According to the initial state, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the user input.
   - The last two values printed are `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is 2.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If the user input is not `<`, then `mak` remains 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the user input is not explicitly provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the task requires us to determine exactly what will be printed based on the given initial state.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is `<`, otherwise [mak] is 0)**
