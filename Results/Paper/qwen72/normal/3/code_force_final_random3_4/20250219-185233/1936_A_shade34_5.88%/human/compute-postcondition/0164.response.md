Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 3 and the output buffer has been flushed. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and the output buffer has been flushed.***
