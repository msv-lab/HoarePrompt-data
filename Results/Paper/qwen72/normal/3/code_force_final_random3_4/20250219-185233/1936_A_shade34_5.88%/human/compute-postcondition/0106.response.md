Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is not `<`, `pans` is an empty list unless `s` is `=`, in which case `pans` is a list containing `[0]`.***
