Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is a list containing the indices for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<`. `mak` is the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

Explanation:
- After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.
- `pans` will contain the indices for which the user input was `=`. If the user input was `<` at any index, `pans` will also contain that highest index.
- `mak` will be the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` will be equal to `mak` because `mak2` is updated to match `mak` in each iteration.
