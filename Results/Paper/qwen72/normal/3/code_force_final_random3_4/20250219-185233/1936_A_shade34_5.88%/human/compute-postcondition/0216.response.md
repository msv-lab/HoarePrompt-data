Output State: **`i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>` or remains 0 if no such input was received.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `len(pans) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `pans`.
- The list `pans` will still contain all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and it must have at least 2 elements.
- The variable `n` will still be greater than the length of `pans`.
- The variable `mak2` will still be equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
- The output buffer will have been flushed.
- The variable `mak` will be the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, or it will remain 0 if no such input was received during the loop execution.
