Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `=`, or `[0, 1]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, `mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, 0 if `s` is `=`, and remains 0 if no `<` is found, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.***
