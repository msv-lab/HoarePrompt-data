The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates in an environment where there is a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, with `n` being an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The function returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, and both indices are within the range 0 ≤ i, j < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an environment with a hidden permutation of integers and returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, within the constraints of making at most 3n queries.**
