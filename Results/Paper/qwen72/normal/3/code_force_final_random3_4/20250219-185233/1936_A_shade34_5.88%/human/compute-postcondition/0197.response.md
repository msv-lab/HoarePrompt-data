Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `pans` is a list containing `[2]` if `s` is `<`, `[1, 2]` if `s` is `=`, or `[0, 1, 2]` if `s` is `<` and `mak` is 1, otherwise `pans` remains `[2]`. `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, `mak` is 2 if `s` is `<`, 1 if `s` is `<` and `mak` was 1 before, and 0 if `s` is `=` or no `<` is found. `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.***
