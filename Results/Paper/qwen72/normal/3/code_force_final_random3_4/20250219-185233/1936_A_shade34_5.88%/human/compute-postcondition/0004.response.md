Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is the loop control variable. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of this task.)
   - `n` must be greater than 1. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of this task.)
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The string `'?'` is printed as is.
   - The value of `mak` is 0, so the first `mak` in the print statement will be 0.
   - The second `mak` in the print statement will also be 0.
   - The value of `i` is 1, so the first `i` in the print statement will be 1.
   - The second `i` in the print statement will also be 1.

4. **Final Output:**
   The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i` separated by spaces.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
