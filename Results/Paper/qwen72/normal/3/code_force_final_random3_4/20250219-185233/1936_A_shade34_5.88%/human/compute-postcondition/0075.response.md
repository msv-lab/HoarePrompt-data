Output State: **`i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `mak` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0.**

The value of `mak` has been set to 0. The values of `i`, `pans`, the output buffer status, and `n` remain unchanged.
