Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `flag` is False.**

The value of `flag` is set to False, and the other variables (`t`, `arr`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The condition that `flag` remains True if `arr[1]` is equal to `arr[0]` is no longer valid.
