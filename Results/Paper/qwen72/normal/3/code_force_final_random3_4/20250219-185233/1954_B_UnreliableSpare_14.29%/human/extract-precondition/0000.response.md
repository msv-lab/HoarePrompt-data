Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) for a beautiful array of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to correctly handle the input:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each representing a beautiful array.
