Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val` before encountering a different element, or `n` if all elements are equal to `val`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`.
- If `ans` was previously `Decimal('Infinity')`, it will now be updated to the value of `cnt` if `cnt` is less than `Decimal('Infinity')`.
- If `ans` was already less than `cnt`, it remains unchanged.
- If all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`, `cnt` is equal to `n`, and `ans` will remain `Decimal('Infinity')` if it was already `Decimal('Infinity')`.
- All other variables (`t`, `arr`, `i`, `n`, `flag`, `val`, and `cnt`) retain their initial values and conditions.
