### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check if All Elements are the Same**:
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - If all elements are the same, the array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed, so the program prints `-1`.

3. **Calculate Minimum Consecutive Elements**:
   - If not all elements are the same, the program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to find the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the longest prefix of consecutive elements equal to the first element `val` and updates `ans` with the minimum length of such a prefix.

4. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `Decimal`**:
  - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be simplified to `float('inf')`.
  - The program should use `float('inf')` instead of `Decimal('Infinity')` for better performance and simplicity.

- **Logic for Minimum Consecutive Elements**:
  - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the longest prefix of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
  - The correct approach should involve checking if there are any elements that can be removed to break the beautiful property. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` after removal.

### Correct Approach:
- To determine the minimum number of elements to remove, we need to:
  - Check if all elements are the same. If they are, print `-1`.
  - Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) satisfies `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only checks the longest prefix of consecutive elements, which is insufficient.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
