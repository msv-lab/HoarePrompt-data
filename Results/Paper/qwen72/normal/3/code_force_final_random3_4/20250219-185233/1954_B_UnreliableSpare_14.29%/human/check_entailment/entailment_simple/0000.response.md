### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Check if All Elements are the Same**:
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - If all elements are the same, it sets `flag` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Finding the Minimum Elements to Remove**:
   - If not all elements are the same (`flag` is `False`), the program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and `val` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements equal to `val` (`cnt`).
   - If a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` again.

4. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If `flag` is `False`, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `Decimal('Infinity')`**:
  - Using `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler `float('inf')` or a large integer.
- **Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove**:
  - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only checks the prefix of the array and does not consider the entire array.
  - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, which means breaking the condition where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for any `i` in the range `2 <= i <= n-1`.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify the positions where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i] != a[i-1]`.
- Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break these conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n <= 2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        flag = True
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
                flag = False
                break
        
        if flag:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        ans = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
                cnt = 1
                while i + cnt < n and arr[i + cnt] == arr[i + 1]:
                    cnt += 1
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        if ans == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The original program does not correctly handle the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only checks the prefix and does not consider the entire array.
- **False**: The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
