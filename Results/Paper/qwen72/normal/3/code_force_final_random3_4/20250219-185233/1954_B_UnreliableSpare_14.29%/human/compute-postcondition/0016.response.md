Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is still a list of integers with the sum of the lengths of all inner lists not exceeding 3 · 10^5, `i` is the index just before the end of the list (i.e., `n-1`), `n` is the length of the list `arr`, and `flag` will be True only if all elements in `arr` are the same. If any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, `flag` will be set to False and the loop will terminate early.
