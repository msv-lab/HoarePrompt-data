Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 2, and `ans` is the minimum of Decimal('Infinity') and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2.
- The values of `t`, `arr`, `i`, `n`, `flag`, and `val` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is still the minimum of Decimal('Infinity') and `cnt`, which is now 2.
