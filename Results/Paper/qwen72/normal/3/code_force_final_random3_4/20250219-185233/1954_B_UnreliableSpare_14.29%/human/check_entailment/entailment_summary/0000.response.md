Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, the implementation has some issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Use of `Decimal` for Minimum Calculation**: The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` for initializing the minimum value `ans` is unnecessary and overly complex. A simple Python `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9` would suffice and is more appropriate for this context.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Elements to Remove**: The logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements from the start of the array that are equal to the first element. This does not correctly address the problem of making the array non-beautiful. The correct approach should involve checking the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" condition, which is defined by the ability to make all elements the same using the specified operation.

3. **Handling of Consecutive Elements**: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has consecutive elements that are the same but not all elements are the same. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should determine that removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) can make the array non-beautiful. However, the current logic does not capture this.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases more robustly. For example, if the array has only one element, it should print `-1` because it is impossible to make a single-element array non-beautiful.

5. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach should involve checking if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. This can be done by identifying the longest subarray where the "beautiful" condition can be applied and then determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break this condition.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
