Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here are the issues:

1. **Flag for Identical Elements**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same using a flag. If they are, it prints `-1`, which is correct.
   - However, if the array is not entirely identical, the program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove, but it does so incorrectly.

2. **Minimum Elements to Remove**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`val`).
   - It then tries to find the minimum count of such consecutive elements, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify if the array is already not beautiful by checking if there are no valid indices `i` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and `a_i` can be replaced.
- If the array is beautiful, you need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property. This involves checking if removing any element can prevent the array from being beautiful.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_elements_to_remove(n, arr):
    if n <= 2:
        return -1
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        return -1
    
    # Check if the array is already not beautiful
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] != arr[i + 1]:
            return 1
    
    # If the array is beautiful, we need to remove at least 3 elements
    return 3

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min_elements_to_remove(n, arr))
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Check for Small Arrays**:
   - If the array has 1 or 2 elements, it cannot be beautiful, so we return `-1`.

2. **Check for Identical Elements**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, so we return `-1`.

3. **Check for Non-Beautiful Property**:
   - If there is any index `i` where `a_{i-1} != a_{i+1}`, removing one element at that index will make the array not beautiful, so we return `1`.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If the array is beautiful and none of the above conditions are met, we need to remove at least 3 elements to break the beautiful property, so we return `3`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
