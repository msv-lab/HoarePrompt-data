Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30.
- `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100.
- `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9.
- `s` is the second line of the input file.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the integer values from the second line of the input file.
- The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` are not used in this print statement, so their specific values do not affect the output.

Output: **YES**
