Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100 and x is greater than or equal to k - 2 and not equal to k - 1, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, `s` is the second line of the input file, `z` is now equal to `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `z` was initially `k - 2`.
- The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates `z` by adding the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- `z // (k - 1)` is the integer division of `z` by `k - 1`, which is `0` if `z < k - 1` and `1` if `z >= k - 1`.
- Therefore, `z` is updated to `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
