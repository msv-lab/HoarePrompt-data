Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins is flawed. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

### Test Case:
```
3 2 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
NO
```

### Actual Output:
```
YES
```

### Explanation:
For the input `k = 3`, `x = 2`, and `a = 1`, the program incorrectly outputs "YES". According to the problem description, Sasha cannot lose more than 2 times in a row. However, with only 1 coin initially, if Sasha loses the first bet, he will have 0 coins left and will not be able to place any more bets. Therefore, he cannot guarantee to win any number of coins, and the correct output should be "NO".

The program's logic for handling the case when `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` is incorrect, leading to this failure. Specifically, the conditions and the logic for calculating `z` in the `else` block are not robust enough to handle all edge cases.
