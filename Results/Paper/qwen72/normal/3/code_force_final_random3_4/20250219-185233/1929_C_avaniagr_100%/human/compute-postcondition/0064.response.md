Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file, `s` is the fourth line of the input file, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, `x - k + 3` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated by the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Initially, `z` is `k - 2`.
- The new value of `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
