Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file, and `s` is the third line of the input file. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the condition `a >= x + 2` holds. If `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 2`, the condition `a < x + 2` holds. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1` and `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is the result of the expression `k - 2 + sum((z // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x - k + 3))`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the condition `a >= z` holds. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds; if `a` is less than `x + 1`, the condition `a < x + 1` holds.***
