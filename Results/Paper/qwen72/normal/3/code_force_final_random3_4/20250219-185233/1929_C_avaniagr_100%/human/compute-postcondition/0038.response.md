Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file, and `s` is the third line of the input file. If `x < k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds; if `a` is less than `x + 1`, the condition `a < x + 1` holds. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part; if `a` is less than `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 2` and not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is the result of the loop body being applied `x - k + 3` times; if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the program retains these conditions; if `a` is less than `z`, the program also retains these conditions.**
