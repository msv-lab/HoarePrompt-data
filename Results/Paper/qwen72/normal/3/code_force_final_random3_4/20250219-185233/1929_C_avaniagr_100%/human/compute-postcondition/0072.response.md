Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file, `s` is the fourth line of the input file, `z` is the result of the expression `k - 2 + (x - k + 3) * (1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1))`, `x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `a` is less than `z`.**
