Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `cnt` is 1 or 2, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 1.** 

The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
