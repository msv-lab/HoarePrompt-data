Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is 0, and if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1.***
