Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial constraints on `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
