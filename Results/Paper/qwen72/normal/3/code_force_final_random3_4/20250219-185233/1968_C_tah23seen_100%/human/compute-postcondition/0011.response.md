Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, and `i` is -1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The `arr` list remains unchanged, with each element still within the range 1 to 500.
- The `n` value also remains unchanged, still within the range 2 to 500.
- The `ans` list, which initially had all elements set to 1000000000, now has its elements from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` updated. Each updated element is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.
- The loop variable `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it becomes -1, which is the point where the loop condition `i >= 0` fails and the loop terminates.
