The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 5` and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `n - 6` and still be greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, and `i` is `n - 6` and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**
