Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[n - 1]`, which is 1000000000.
- Therefore, `ans[i]` is now `1000000000 - arr[i]`.
- The states of `arr`, `n`, and the other elements of `ans` remain unchanged.
