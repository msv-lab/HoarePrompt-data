Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `n` - 1, `arr` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 <= `n` <= 18), `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is `True`.**

The code snippet sets the variable `is_already_stairs` to `True`. All other variables (`i`, `start_index`, `arr`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
