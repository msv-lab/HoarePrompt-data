Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + 2`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.**

The code snippet `arr[j] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element at index `j` in the array `arr`. Since `j` is already defined as `start_index + 2` and `arr[j]` was initially equal to `i`, the assignment does not change the value of `arr[j]`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
