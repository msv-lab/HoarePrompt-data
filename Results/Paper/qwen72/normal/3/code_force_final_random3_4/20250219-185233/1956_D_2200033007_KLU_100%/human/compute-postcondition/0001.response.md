The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is at least 0, the loop can execute. The state of `j` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `i` must be a non-negative integer, and `j` will start at 0.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0**
