You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= n - 1, arr is a list of integers of length n (1 <= n <= 18), and res is a list of tuples representing the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i`, and `i + 1` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`. If any element at index `start_index + j` in the array `arr` is not equal to `j` for `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` retains its value as `True`.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i`, and `i + 1` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`. If any element at index `start_index + j` in the array `arr` is not equal to `j` for `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` retains its value as `True`. Additionally, `is_already_stairs` is False.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i`, and `i + 1` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`. If any element at index `start_index + j` in the array `arr` is not equal to `j` for `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` retains its value as `True`. Additionally, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `i` is greater than 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is greater than 0, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + i`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i` for all `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` inclusive, and `res` has a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended to it.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i`, `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `i` is greater than 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + i - 1`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i - 1` for all `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` inclusive, and `res` has a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)` appended to it.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and implicitly uses `start_index`, `arr`, and `res`. Regardless of the input, the function always returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None.

Case_2: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
