Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the sum of the elements in an array by performing a set of operations that involve setting a subarray to the MEX of that subarray. The core of the solution is to use dynamic programming to find the maximum possible sum and the operations needed to achieve it. Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **func_1(start_index, end_index)**:
   - This function computes the maximum sum that can be achieved for the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`.
   - It uses memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - If `start_index == end_index`, it returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]` because the MEX of a single-element subarray is at least 1.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it calculates the maximum sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the value of the MEX for each split.
   - The function updates `res_dict` with the computed maximum sum for the subarray and returns this value.

2. **func_2(start_index, end_index)**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is greater than 0. If it is, no operation is needed; otherwise, it returns a single operation to set the element to 1.
   - If the maximum sum for the subarray is equal to the square of its length, it assumes the subarray can be transformed into a "staircase" (where each element is set to its index) and calls `make_stairs` to perform the necessary operations.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks different splits of the subarray to find the operations that achieve the maximum sum.

3. **make_stairs(i)**:
   - This function transforms a subarray into a "staircase" where each element is set to its index.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase form. If it is, it returns.
   - If the subarray is not in the staircase form, it recursively sets the elements to the MEX value and appends the operations to `res`.

### Issues and Analysis:

1. **func_1(start_index, end_index)**:
   - The function correctly computes the maximum sum for a subarray using dynamic programming and memoization.
   - The logic for splitting the subarray and calculating the MEX is sound, but the implementation of the MEX calculation is missing. The function should compute the MEX of the subarray and use it in the operations.

2. **func_2(start_index, end_index)**:
   - The function correctly constructs the sequence of operations based on the results from `func_1`.
   - The logic for handling the "staircase" transformation is present, but the `make_stairs` function is not properly integrated into the main logic. The `make_stairs` function should be called with the correct `start_index` and `end_index` to transform the subarray.

3. **make_stairs(i)**:
   - The function is intended to transform a subarray into a staircase, but it lacks the `start_index` parameter, which is crucial for determining the range of the subarray.
   - The function should take `start_index` as a parameter and use it to correctly set the elements in the subarray.

### Conclusion:

The program is **incorrect** because:
- The MEX calculation is missing in `func_1`.
- The `make_stairs` function is not properly integrated and lacks the necessary parameters to correctly transform the subarray.

Correctness: **False**
