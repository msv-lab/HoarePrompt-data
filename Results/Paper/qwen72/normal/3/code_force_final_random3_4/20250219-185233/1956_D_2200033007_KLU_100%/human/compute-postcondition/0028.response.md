Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + 1`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.**

The code snippet `arr[j] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element in the array `arr` at index `j`. Since `j` is already `start_index + 1` and `arr[j]` was already equal to `i`, the array `arr` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `start_index`, and `j` are not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
