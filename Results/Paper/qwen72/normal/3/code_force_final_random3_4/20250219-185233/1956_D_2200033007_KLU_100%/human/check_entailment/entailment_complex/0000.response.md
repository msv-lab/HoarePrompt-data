### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations are limited to no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - For a single element subarray, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
   - For a subarray with more than one element, it tries to split the subarray and calculate the maximum sum recursively.
   - The function correctly handles the base case and recursive case, ensuring that the maximum sum is calculated for all possible subarrays.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
   - It first checks if the subarray is already optimal (i.e., the maximum value is the square of the length of the subarray).
   - If the subarray is optimal, it appends the entire subarray to the result list.
   - If not, it recursively divides the subarray and constructs the operations accordingly.
   - The function correctly identifies the optimal subarray splits and constructs the operations to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is responsible for transforming a subarray into a "staircase" pattern, where each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i` is set to `i`.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern.
   - If not, it recursively sets the elements to `i` and appends the operation to the result list.
   - The function correctly modifies the array and appends the operations to achieve the staircase pattern.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the input, initializes the array, and calls `func_1` to calculate the maximum sum.
   - It then calls `func_2` to construct the sequence of operations.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - The program correctly follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem's requirements and constraints. It calculates the maximum sum and constructs the sequence of operations to achieve that sum.

**Correctness: True**
