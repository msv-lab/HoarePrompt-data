Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + i - 1`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i - 1` for all `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` inclusive, and `res` has a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)` appended to it.**
