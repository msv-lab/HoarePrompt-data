### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the MEX operation as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **MEX Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations. However, it does not actually compute the MEX of the subarray and apply the operation as required.
   - Instead, it attempts to maximize the sum through a different approach, which involves recursive calls and a heuristic that does not align with the MEX operation.
   - The line `res = (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2` is particularly problematic because it assumes a fixed value for the maximum sum, which is not necessarily the MEX of the subarray.

2. **Incorrect MEX Handling in `make_stairs`**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is designed to transform a subarray into a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation.
   - It assumes that the subarray can be transformed into a sequence of integers from 0 to `i` by setting all elements to `i`, which is not always the correct MEX value.
   - For example, if the subarray is `[0, 2, 1, 3]`, the MEX is 4, but the function will incorrectly set all elements to 3, which is not the correct MEX.

3. **Example Input**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     0 2 1 3
     ```
   - The correct output should be:
     ```
     16 1
     1 4
     ```
     This is because the MEX of the entire array is 4, and setting all elements to 4 results in the maximum sum of 16.
   - However, the provided program will likely produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly compute the MEX and apply the operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the MEX operation and does not follow the problem's requirements for maximizing the sum of the array. The issues in `func_1` and `make_stairs` lead to incorrect results, and the provided example input further confirms this. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.
