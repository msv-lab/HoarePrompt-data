### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not handle the MEX operation as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues in the program:

1. **MEX Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations. However, it does not actually compute the MEX of the subarray.
   - Instead, it tries to maximize the sum by considering different subarray splits and adding the values of the subarrays. This approach is fundamentally different from the problem's requirement to compute the MEX and set the subarray elements to this MEX value.

2. **Incorrect MEX Handling in `make_stairs`**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is designed to transform a subarray into a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation.
   - It assumes that the subarray can be transformed into a sequence of integers from 0 to `i` by setting all elements to `i`, which is not always the correct MEX value.
   - For example, if the subarray is `[0, 2, 1, 3]`, the MEX is 4, but the function will set all elements to 3, which is incorrect.

3. **Example Input**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     0 2 1 3
     ```
   - The correct output should be:
     ```
     16 1
     1 4
     ```
   - This is because the MEX of the entire array is 4, and setting all elements to 4 results in the maximum sum of 16.
   - However, the provided program will likely produce an incorrect result because it does not compute the MEX and instead uses a different approach to maximize the sum.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the MEX operation and does not align with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
