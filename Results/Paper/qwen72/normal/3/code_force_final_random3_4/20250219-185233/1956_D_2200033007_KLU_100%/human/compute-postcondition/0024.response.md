The code snippet appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. The values of `i`, `j`, `is_already_stairs`, and the condition that `i + 1` must be greater than or equal to `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `i` is greater than 0 and the element at index `start_index + i` in the array `arr` is not equal to `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i - 1`, `i + 1` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `is_already_stairs` is False, `i` is greater than 0, the element at index `start_index + i` in the array `arr` is not equal to `i`, and `res` has a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended to it.**
