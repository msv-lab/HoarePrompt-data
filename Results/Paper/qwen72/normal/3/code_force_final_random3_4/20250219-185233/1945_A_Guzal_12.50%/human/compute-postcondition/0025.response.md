The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes the assignment of values to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the `print` statement will simply output `-1` as specified.

Output: **-1**
