Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.**

The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
