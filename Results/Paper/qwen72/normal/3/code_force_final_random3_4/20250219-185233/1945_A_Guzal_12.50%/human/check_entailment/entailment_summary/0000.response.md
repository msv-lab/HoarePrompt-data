### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Introverts (a):**
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent, so the number of tents needed for introverts is `a`.

3. **Extroverts (b):**
   - Each tent for extroverts must contain exactly 3 people. Therefore, the number of tents needed for extroverts is `b // 3` if `b` is divisible by 3. If not, we need to account for the remaining extroverts.

4. **Universals (c):**
   - Universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in tents with extroverts. If `b` is not divisible by 3, the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, and the sum `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it is impossible to form complete tents for the remaining extroverts, and the function correctly prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the total number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3` and adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0` to account for any remaining participants.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct number of tents for each test case or `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the given constraints and edge cases correctly. It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for each test case and prints `-1` when it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
