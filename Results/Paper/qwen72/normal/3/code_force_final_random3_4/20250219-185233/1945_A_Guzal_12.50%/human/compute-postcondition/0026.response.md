Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is `k` + `a` + (`b` + `c`) // 3.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated by adding `a` and the integer division of (`b` + `c`) by 3 to its current value.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same as they were assigned from the input integers.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
