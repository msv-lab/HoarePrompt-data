Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). It then calculates a value `k` based on the inputs and prints it. If `b` is not divisible by 3 and `c` is less than 3, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `a + (b + c) // 3` and increments `k` by 1 if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last values read from the input for the final iteration. **
