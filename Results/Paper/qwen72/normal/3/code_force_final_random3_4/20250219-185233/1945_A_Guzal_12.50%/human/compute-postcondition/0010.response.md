Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and either `b` is divisible by 3 or `c` is greater than or equal to 3, or `(b + c)` is divisible by 3. If `(b + c)` is not divisible by 3, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.***
