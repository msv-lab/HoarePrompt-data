The `print(-1)` statement will print the integer `-1`. The precondition provides details about the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The value `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **-1**
