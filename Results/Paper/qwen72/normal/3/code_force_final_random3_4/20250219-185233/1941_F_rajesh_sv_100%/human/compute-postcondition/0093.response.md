Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[l] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is undefined because `mid + 1` is not within the bounds of `D`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` and `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`**

Explanation:
- `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, which is the midpoint between `l` and `h`.
- All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, `h`, `ans`, `f`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
