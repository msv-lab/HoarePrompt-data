Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9. `F` is a list of `k` integers, where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, and `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`. `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to the previous value of `max_diff`, and `index` is updated to 3. Otherwise, if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is not greater than `max_diff` or `next_max_diff`, then `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged.***
