Output State: **`A` remains a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` remains a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` remains a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` remains the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` remains the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` remains the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` remains `n - 1`, `diff` remains the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` remains `A[index - 1]`, `right` remains `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[j] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[j]` for all `j` in `0` to `k-1` where `l` is the index found by the binary search for each `f` in `F`, `l` is the final index found by the binary search for the last `f` in `F`, `h` is the final index found by the binary search for the last `f` in `F`, `mid` is the final value of `l` (or `h`) for the last `f` in `F`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[k-1]`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[k-1]` if `mid + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The list `A` remains unchanged and is still a strictly increasing list of `n` integers.
- The variables `m` and `k` retain their values as returned by `func_4()`.
- The list `D` remains a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`.
- The list `F` remains unchanged and is still a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`.
- The variables `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `i`, `diff`, `left`, and `right` retain their initial values.
- The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum value of its initial state and the maximum of `D[l] + F[j] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[j]` for each `f` in `F` (where `j` ranges from `0` to `k-1`), with `l` being the index found by the binary search for each `f`.
- The variables `l`, `h`, and `mid` are updated to their final values after the last iteration of the loop, where `l` and `h` are the indices found by the binary search for the last `f` in `F`, and `mid` is the final value of `l` (or `h`).
- The variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to their final values for the last `f` in `F`, where `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[k-1]` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[k-1]` if `mid + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined.
