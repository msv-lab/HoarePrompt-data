Postcondition: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` remains greater than `l`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` and `l` remains less than `h`. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively.**
