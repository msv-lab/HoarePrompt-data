Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9. `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2. `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9. `F` is a list of `k` integers, where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, and `F` is the list returned by `func_4()` and must have at least 1 element. `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`. `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`. `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference. `i` is `n - 1`, and `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A` (i.e., `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`). `left` is `A[index - 1]` and `right` is `A[index]`. `ans` is equal to `max_diff`. `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `l` is assigned the result of `bisect_right(D, left - F[0])`, which finds the insertion point in the sorted list `D` for the value `left - F[0]` to maintain the sorted order.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
