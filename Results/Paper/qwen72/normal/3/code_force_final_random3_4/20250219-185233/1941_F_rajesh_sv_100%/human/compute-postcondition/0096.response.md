Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` and `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`, and the current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than the current value of `right - mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, `mid`, `ans`, `f`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum` still holds true.
- The relationship between `l` and `h` (`h` must be greater than `l`) is still valid after the update.
