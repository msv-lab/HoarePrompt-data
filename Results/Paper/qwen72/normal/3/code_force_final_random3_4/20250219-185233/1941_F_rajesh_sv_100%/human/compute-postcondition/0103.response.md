Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, `mid`, `ans`, `f`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `h` must be greater than `l` is still valid, but now `l` is `mid + 1`.
- The expression for `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, which now uses the new value of `l`.
