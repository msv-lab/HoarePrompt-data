Postcondition: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9. `F` is a list of `k` integers, where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, and `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`. `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None, `i` is 1, `diff` is A[1] - A[0]. `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and less than or equal to `max_diff`.**
