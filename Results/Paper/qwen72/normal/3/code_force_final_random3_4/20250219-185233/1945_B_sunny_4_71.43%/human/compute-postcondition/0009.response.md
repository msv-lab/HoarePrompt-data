Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.**

The code snippet `B = int(m / b) + 1` reassigns the value of `B` to `int(m / b) + 1`. Since `B` was already defined as `int(m / b) + 1` in the initial state, the value of `B` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
