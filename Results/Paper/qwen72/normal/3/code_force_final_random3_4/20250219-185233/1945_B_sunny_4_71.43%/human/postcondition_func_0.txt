The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from user input. It then calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m / b) + 1` for each test case, and prints the sum `A + B`. After all test cases are processed, the function does not return any value, but the user will have seen the sum `A + B` printed for each test case.
