The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `_` is a placeholder variable that increments by 1 after each iteration.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `_` must be less than `t`.

State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**
