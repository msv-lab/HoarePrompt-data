Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder variable (not used in the code snippet).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(A + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **User Input:**
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user.
   - For example, let's say `a = 3`, `b = 5`, and `m = 15`.

2. **Calculate `A`:**
   - `A = int(m / a) + 1`
   - Using the example values: `A = int(15 / 3) + 1 = int(5) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`

3. **Calculate `B`:**
   - `B = int(m / b) + 1`
   - Using the example values: `B = int(15 / 5) + 1 = int(3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`

4. **Sum `A` and `B`:**
   - `A + B = 6 + 4 = 10`

### General Case:
- `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a` plus 1.
- `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 1.
- The print statement will output the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the sum of `A` and `B`, where `A` is `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.

Output: **A + B (where A is int(m / a) + 1 and B is int(m / b) + 1)**
