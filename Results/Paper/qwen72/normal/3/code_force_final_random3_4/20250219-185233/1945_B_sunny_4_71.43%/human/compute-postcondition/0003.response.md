Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`.** 

The value of `A` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `a`, plus 1. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
