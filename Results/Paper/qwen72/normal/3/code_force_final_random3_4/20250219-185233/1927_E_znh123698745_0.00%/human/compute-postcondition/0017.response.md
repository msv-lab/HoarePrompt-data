Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the element `array[a[0]]`, `a[0]` is 2.**

The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
