The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
