Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `(-1) ** i` is -1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. Otherwise, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.***
