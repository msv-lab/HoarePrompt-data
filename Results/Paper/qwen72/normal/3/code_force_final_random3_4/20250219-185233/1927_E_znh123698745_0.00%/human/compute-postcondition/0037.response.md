The provided code snippet is:
```
answer.append(array[a[0]])
```

Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:
- The variable `answer` is a list, and the `append` method adds the element `array[a[0]]` to the end of the list `answer`.
- The variable `array` is a list, and `a[0]` is an index used to access an element from `array`.
- The variable `a` is a list or tuple, and `a[0]` is its first element, which is used as an index for `array`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `(-1)` is not a valid Python expression and seems to be a typo or placeholder. We will ignore it for the purpose of this task.

The code does not change the values of `n` or `i`, but it updates the `answer` list by appending the element at the index `a[0]` from the `array` list.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list with an additional element `array[a[0]]` appended to it.**
