### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a permutation of length \( n \) such that the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.
   - \( k \) is guaranteed to be even, and \( k \le n \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes a list `array` with integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then constructs the permutation `answer` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements in `array`.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `array` is initialized as a list of integers from 1 to \( n \).
     - `answer` is initialized with the first element `[1]`.
     - `a` is initialized as a list `[1, -1]` to keep track of the indices for the smallest and largest elements.

   - **Loop to Construct the Permutation:**
     - The loop runs from 1 to \( n-1 \) (i.e., \( n-1 \) iterations).
     - For each iteration \( i \):
       - If \( (-1)^i \) is -1, it appends the largest remaining element to `answer` and decrements the index for the largest element.
       - If \( (-1)^i \) is 1, it appends the smallest remaining element to `answer` and increments the index for the smallest element.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Permutation Construction:**
     - The program ensures that all elements from 1 to \( n \) are used exactly once, forming a valid permutation.
   - **Sum Condition:**
     - The alternating pattern of appending the smallest and largest elements ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) will be balanced.
     - For example, if \( k = 4 \), the sums of segments like `[1, 8, 4, 10]`, `[8, 4, 10, 2]`, etc., will be close to each other, differing by at most 1.
   - **Mathematical Justification:**
     - By alternating between the smallest and largest elements, the program ensures that the sums of the segments are distributed evenly. This is because the sum of a segment will include both high and low values, balancing out the total sum.
     - For an even \( k \), this alternating pattern will ensure that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any \( k \)-length segment is at most 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the smallest valid input \( n = k = 2 \) correctly.
   - It also handles larger values of \( n \) and \( k \) as per the problem constraints.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.
   - The permutation is constructed in such a way that the sum condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a \( k \)-level permutation for the given problem constraints. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
