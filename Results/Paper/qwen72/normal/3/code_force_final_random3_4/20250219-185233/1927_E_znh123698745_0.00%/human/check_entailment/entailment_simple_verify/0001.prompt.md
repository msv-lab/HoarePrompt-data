You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    #State: The loop has executed for all iterations, and for each iteration, the `answer` list contains the integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order, which alternates between the first and last elements of the `array` list. The `a` list contains the integers `n` and `0` respectively, and the `array` list remains a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation of length \( n \) such that the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.
   - \( k \) is guaranteed to be even, and \( k \le n \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes a list `array` with integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then constructs the permutation `answer` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements in `array`.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `array` is initialized as a list of integers from 1 to \( n \).
     - `answer` is initialized with the first element `[1]`.
     - `a` is initialized as a list `[1, -1]` to keep track of the indices for the smallest and largest elements.

   - **Loop to Construct the Permutation:**
     - The loop runs from 1 to \( n-1 \) (i.e., \( n-1 \) iterations).
     - For each iteration \( i \):
       - If \( (-1)^i \) is -1, it appends the largest remaining element to `answer` and decrements the index for the largest element.
       - If \( (-1)^i \) is 1, it appends the smallest remaining element to `answer` and increments the index for the smallest element.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Permutation Construction:**
     - The program ensures that all elements from 1 to \( n \) are used exactly once, forming a valid permutation.
   - **Sum Condition:**
     - The alternating pattern of appending the smallest and largest elements ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) will be balanced.
     - For example, if \( k = 4 \), the sums of segments like `[1, 8, 4, 10]`, `[8, 4, 10, 2]`, etc., will be close to each other, differing by at most 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the smallest valid input \( n = k = 2 \) correctly.
   - It also handles larger values of \( n \) and \( k \) as per the problem constraints.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.
   - The permutation is constructed in such a way that the sum condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a \( k \)-level permutation for the given problem constraints. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
