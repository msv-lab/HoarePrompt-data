Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, `answer` has a new element appended which is the value of `array[a[-1] + 1]`.** 

The value of `a[-1]` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `answer` has a new element appended which is the value of `array[a[-1]]`. After `a[-1]` is decremented, the value that was appended to `answer` is now the value of `array[a[-1] + 1]`. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
