Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `answer` is a list that includes the element at the index specified by the last element of `a` in `array`, and `a[-1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of `array` is updated to 2, and `answer` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the integer at index `a[0]` of `array` (which is now 2).***
