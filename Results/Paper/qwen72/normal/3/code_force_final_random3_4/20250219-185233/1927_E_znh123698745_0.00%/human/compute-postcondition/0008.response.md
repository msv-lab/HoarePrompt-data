Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `(-1)` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1.
- Initially, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.
- After the code execution, the last element of `a` becomes -2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
