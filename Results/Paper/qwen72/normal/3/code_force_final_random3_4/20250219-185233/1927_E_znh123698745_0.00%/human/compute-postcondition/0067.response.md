The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, and the range definition in the for loop. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
