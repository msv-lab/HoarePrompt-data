Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and k is even, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.** 

The values of `n` and `k` remain as provided by the input, and `array` is now a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
