Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `answer` is a list that now contains the element at the index specified by the last element of `a` minus 1 from the `array`, and the last element of `a` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of `array` is now 2, and `answer` is a list that includes the first element of `array` (which was 1 before and is now 2).***
