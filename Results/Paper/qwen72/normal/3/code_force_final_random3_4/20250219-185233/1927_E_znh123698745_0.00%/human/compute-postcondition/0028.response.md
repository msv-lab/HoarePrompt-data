Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in reverse order, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are now the integers provided by the user input, while the other variables (`array`, `i`, `answer`, and `a`) retain their initial definitions based on the new value of `n`.
