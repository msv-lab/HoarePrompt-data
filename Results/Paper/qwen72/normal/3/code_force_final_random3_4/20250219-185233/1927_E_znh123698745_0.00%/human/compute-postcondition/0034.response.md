Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the value of `(-1)` remains unchanged, `answer` is a list that now includes the element at the index `a[-1]` from `array`.** 

The code snippet appends the element from `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the list `answer`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `(-1)` are not affected by this operation.
