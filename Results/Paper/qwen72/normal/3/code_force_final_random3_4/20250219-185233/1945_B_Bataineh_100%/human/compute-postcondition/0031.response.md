Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (i.e., `m < b and m > a`), the condition `m < b and m > a` is true. In all other cases, `m` is either less than or equal to `a` or greater than or equal to `b`.***
