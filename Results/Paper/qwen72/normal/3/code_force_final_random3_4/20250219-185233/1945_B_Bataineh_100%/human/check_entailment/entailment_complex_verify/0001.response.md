### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations launching fireworks at different frequencies \(a\) and \(b\).
   - Each firework is visible for \(m + 1\) minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\).
   - The output is the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time for each test case.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - Fireworks launched by the first installation are visible at times \(a, 2a, 3a, \ldots\).
   - Fireworks launched by the second installation are visible at times \(b, 2b, 3b, \ldots\).
   - Each firework is visible for \(m + 1\) minutes, so if a firework is launched at time \(x\), it will be visible from \(x\) to \(x + m\).

4. **Conditions in the Program:**
   - **Case 1:** \(m < a\) and \(m < b\)
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are greater than \(m\), then no two fireworks from the same installation can overlap. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (one from each installation).
   - **Case 2:** \(m < a\) and \(m \ge b\)
     - If \(m\) is greater than or equal to \(b\) but less than \(a\), then fireworks from the second installation can overlap with each other, but fireworks from the first installation cannot. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(2 + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor\).
   - **Case 3:** \(m < b\) and \(m \ge a\)
     - If \(m\) is greater than or equal to \(a\) but less than \(b\), then fireworks from the first installation can overlap with each other, but fireworks from the second installation cannot. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(2 + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor\).
   - **Case 4:** \(m \ge a\) and \(m \ge b\)
     - If \(m\) is greater than or equal to both \(a\) and \(b\), then fireworks from both installations can overlap with each other. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2\).

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** \(a = 6\), \(b = 7\), \(m = 4\)
     - \(m < a\) and \(m < b\), so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.
   - **Example 2:** \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), \(m = 10\)
     - \(m > a\) and \(m > b\), so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{10}{4} \right\rfloor + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7\).
   - **Example 3:** \(a = 7\), \(b = 8\), \(m = 56\)
     - \(m > a\) and \(m > b\), so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(\left\lfloor \frac{56}{7} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{56}{8} \right\rfloor + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17\).
   - **Example 4:** \(a = 5\), \(b = 6\), \(m = 78123459896\)
     - \(m > a\) and \(m > b\), so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(\left\lfloor \frac{78123459896}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{78123459896}{6} \right\rfloor + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630\).
   - **Example 5:** \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), \(m = 1\)
     - \(m < a\) and \(m < b\) (since \(a\) and \(b\) are both 1), so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.
   - **Example 6:** \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), \(m = 1000000000000000000\)
     - \(m > a\) and \(m > b\), so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(\left\lfloor \frac{1000000000000000000}{1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1000000000000000000}{1} \right\rfloor + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002\).
