Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `a` and `b` are equal or when `m` is much larger than both `a` and `b`. Here are the issues:

1. **Case when `a` and `b` are equal:**
   - If `a` and `b` are equal, the program will output `2 + m // a` or `2 + m // b` (which are the same). However, the correct answer should be `2 + m // a + 1` because the fireworks from both installations will be visible for `m + 1` minutes, and they will overlap perfectly.

2. **Case when `m` is much larger than both `a` and `b`:**
   - The program simply adds `m // a` and `m // b` to 2, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the maximum overlap.

3. **General Overlap Calculation:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The correct approach involves finding the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining how many fireworks can be seen within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that handles all cases correctly:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 2 + (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD) function from the `math` module.

2. **Maximum Fireworks Calculation:**
   - The maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is calculated as:
     - `2` for the initial fireworks launched at time 0.
     - `(m + 1) // a` for the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility window.
     - `(m + 1) // b` for the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility window.
     - Subtract `(m + 1) // l` to avoid double-counting the overlapping fireworks.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
