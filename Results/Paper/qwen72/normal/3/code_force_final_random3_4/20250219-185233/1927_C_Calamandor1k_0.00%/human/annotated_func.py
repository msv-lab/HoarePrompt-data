#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It then counts the number of elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len(a), len(b))`. If both counts are greater than or equal to `k // 2`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that all input variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) are consumed, and the output for each test case is printed to the console.
