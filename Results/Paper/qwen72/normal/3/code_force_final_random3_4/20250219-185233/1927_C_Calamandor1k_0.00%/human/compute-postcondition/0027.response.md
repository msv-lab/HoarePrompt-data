Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 2, `count_a` is increased by 1, `count_b` remains unchanged.**
