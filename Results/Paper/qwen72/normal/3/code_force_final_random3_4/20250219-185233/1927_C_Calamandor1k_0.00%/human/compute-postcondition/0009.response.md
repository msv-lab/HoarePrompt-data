Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be greater than 0, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, and the length of list `a` (`len_a`) is greater than `i + 1` (which is 1).**
