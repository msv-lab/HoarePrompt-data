To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `_` is a placeholder for the loop.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `b` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `len_a` is the length of list `a`.
   - `len_b` is the length of list `b`.
   - `d` is calculated as `k // 2`.
   - `i` is calculated as `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.
   - `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`.
   - `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement checks if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.
   - `d` is half of `k` (using integer division).
   - `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`.
   - `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - If both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`, the output will be 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `count_a` and `count_b`. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions given:

Output: **'YES' if the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1` is greater than or equal to `k // 2` and the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1` is also greater than or equal to `k // 2`. Otherwise, 'NO'.**
