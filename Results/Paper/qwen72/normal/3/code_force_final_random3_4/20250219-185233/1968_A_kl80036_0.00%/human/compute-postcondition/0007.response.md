Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `x` is an input integer greater than 0. This means `x` can be any positive integer.
   - The variable `y` is defined as the integer result of `x` divided by 2. In Python, integer division is performed using the `//` operator, which truncates the decimal part and returns the floor value.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.

Output: **y (where y is the integer result of x divided by 2)**
