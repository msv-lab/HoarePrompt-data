Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.**

The value of `y` is updated to be the integer division of `x` by 2, which means `y` is now the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
