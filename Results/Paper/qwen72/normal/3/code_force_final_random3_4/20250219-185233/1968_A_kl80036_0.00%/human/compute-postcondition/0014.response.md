Functionality: ** The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and calculates `y` as `x // 2`. The function then prints `y` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` being `t-1`, and `x` being the last input integer greater than 0, with `y` being the integer result of `x` divided by 2. **
