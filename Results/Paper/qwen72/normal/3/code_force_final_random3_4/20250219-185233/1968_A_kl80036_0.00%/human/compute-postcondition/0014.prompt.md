You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with an integer `x` where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, the function should find an integer `y` (1 ≤ y < x) that maximizes the value of gcd(x, y) + y.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `x`. `t` is the number of test cases, an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000. The function returns the maximum value of gcd(x, y) + y for each test case, where `y` is an integer between 1 and `x-1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
