Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house (i.e., output 0) correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` always starts the loop from `i = 0` and checks the condition for each `i` up to `n-1`. However, it does not consider the case where the road should be laid before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`). This means that if the optimal position is before the first house, the program will not output the correct result.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
000
```
The correct output should be `0` because laying the road before the first house satisfies the condition (all residents are on the right side, and all of them want to be on the left side, which is not possible, but the condition is satisfied trivially). However, the program will output `2` because it does not consider the case `i = 0`.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check the case `i = 0` and update the answer if it is the optimal position.
