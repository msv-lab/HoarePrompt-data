Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing `[0, 0]`, `[x, y]`, and `[x, y]` (where `x` and `y` are updated based on the second character of `a`), `s` is the second character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` is incremented by 1, and `x` remains unchanged.**
