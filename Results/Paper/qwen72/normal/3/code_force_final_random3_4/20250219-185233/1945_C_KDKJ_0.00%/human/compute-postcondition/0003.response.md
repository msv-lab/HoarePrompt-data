Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `func_1()` has been called.

```
func_1()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet calls the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` has already been called in the initial state, this call does not change the state of the program. The values of the variables and the condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `func_1()` has been called.**
