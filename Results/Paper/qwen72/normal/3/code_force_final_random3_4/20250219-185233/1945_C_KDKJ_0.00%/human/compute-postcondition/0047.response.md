The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is equal to `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to 1. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.**
