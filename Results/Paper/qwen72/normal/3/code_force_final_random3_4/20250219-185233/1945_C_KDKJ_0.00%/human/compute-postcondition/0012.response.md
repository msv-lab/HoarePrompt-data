Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing `[0, 0]` and `[x, y]`, `s` is the second character of `a`, `x` is the second element of the last sublist in `S`, `y` is the last element of the last sublist in `S`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the values of the last sublist in `S` to `x` and `y`.
- Since `S` is a list containing `[0, 0]` and `[x, y]`, the last sublist is `[x, y]`.
- Therefore, `x` is assigned the value of the first element of `[x, y]`, and `y` is assigned the value of the second element of `[x, y]`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `s` is the second character of `a` and the values of `x` and `y` based on `s` being '0' or not are still valid.
