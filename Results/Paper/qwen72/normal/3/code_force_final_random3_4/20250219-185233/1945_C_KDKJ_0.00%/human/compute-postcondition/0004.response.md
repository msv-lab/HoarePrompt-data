The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop depends on the value of `int(input())` to determine how many times it should run. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented to 2.

However, the value of `int(input())` is determined by user input and is not modified by the loop itself. Therefore, the only state that can be adjusted is `_`.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, and `func_1()` has been called.**
