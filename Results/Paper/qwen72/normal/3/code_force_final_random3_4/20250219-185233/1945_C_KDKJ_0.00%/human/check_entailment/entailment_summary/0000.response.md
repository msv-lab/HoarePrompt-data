### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding a position `i` to place a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side.
   - The road can be placed before the first house (i = 0), between any two houses (1 ≤ i < n), or after the last house (i = n).
   - The goal is to find the position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village (i.e., minimizes `|n/2 - i|`).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: `n` (number of houses) and `a` (string of preferences).
   - **Cumulative Counts**: The function `func_1` computes the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's at each position in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`.
   - **Satisfaction Check**: For each position `i` (0 ≤ i < n), the function checks if the number of '0's on the left side (up to index `i`) is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side, and if the number of '1's on the right side (from index `i` to the end) is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side.
   - **Optimal Position**: The function keeps track of the position `i` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to `n/2` in absolute value. If no such position is found, it prints `0`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The number of test cases `t`.
   - **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness**:
   - **Cumulative Counts**: The cumulative counts are correctly computed and stored in `S`.
   - **Satisfaction Check**: The satisfaction conditions are correctly checked for each position `i`.
   - **Optimal Position**: The function correctly finds the position `i` that minimizes `|n/2 - i|` and satisfies the conditions.
   - **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` the specified number of times.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles all the test cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
