The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop depends on the value returned by `int(input())` to determine how many times it should iterate. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must have been greater than 0, and `_` was 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1.

However, since `int(input())` is a function call that prompts the user for a new input each time the loop condition is checked, the value of `int(input())` can change based on the user's input. Therefore, we cannot assume that `int(input())` will remain the same. Instead, we need to consider the new input value.

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` will be 1.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `func_1()` has been called.**
