Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is equal to `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `ans` is set to 0 if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
