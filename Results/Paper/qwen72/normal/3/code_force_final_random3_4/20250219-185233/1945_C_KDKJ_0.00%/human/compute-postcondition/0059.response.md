Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It computes the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's at each position in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`. The function then finds the index `i` in the string `a` such that the cumulative count of '0's in the left part of the string up to index `i` is at least half of the total count of characters in that part, and the cumulative count of '1's in the right part of the string from index `i` to the end is at least half of the total count of characters in that part. The index `i` that is closest to `n / 2` in absolute value and satisfies these conditions is printed. If no such index is found, the function prints `0`. **
