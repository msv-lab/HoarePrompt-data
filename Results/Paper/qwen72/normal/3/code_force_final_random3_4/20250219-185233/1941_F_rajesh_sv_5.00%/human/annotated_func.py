#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a callable function.
def func_1(func):
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns the `wrapper` function, which is a callable function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable function `func` and returns a `wrapper` function, which is also callable. However, the `wrapper` function is returned without being defined or initialized, leading to a potential issue where the returned `wrapper` is actually `None`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a `d` dictionary that remains empty, and a `wrapper` function is returned, but it is not a valid callable function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of arguments that can be passed to func, and d is a dictionary where keys are tuples of arguments and values are the results of func when called with those arguments.
def wrapper():
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: *`args` is a tuple of arguments that can be passed to `func`, and `d` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of arguments and values are the results of `func` when called with those arguments. If `args` is not in `d`, `d[args]` is now equal to the result of `func(*args)`. Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the result of `func` when called with the arguments in `args`, which is stored in `d[args]`. If `args` was not in `d` initially, `d[args]` is now the result of `func(*args)`. Otherwise, `d[args]` remains the same as it was before.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It checks if the tuple `args` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not in `d`, it calls `func` with the arguments in `args` and stores the result in `d[args]`. The function then returns the value stored in `d[args]`. After the function concludes, `d` contains the result of `func(*args)` for the tuple `args`, and this result is returned to the caller.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature.
def func_2():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the first line of input from the user, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_3` does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return int(func_2())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_2()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_2()`. After the function concludes, the program has an integer value that represents the output of `func_2()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string used to split the input, defaulting to a single space ' '.
def func_4(delimiter):
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the `delimiter` string (defaulting to a single space ' ') and then converting each split part to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `delimiter` (a string, defaulting to a single space ' ') and returns a list of integers. This list is obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the specified `delimiter` and converting each resulting substring to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_5` does not take any parameters.
def func_5():
    return func_2()
    #The program returns the value or output of `func_2()`, which is not specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the value or output of `func_2()`. The final state of the program after `func_5` concludes is that it has returned whatever `func_2()` produces, without modifying any external variables or state.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes no explicit parameters but internally uses values and lists returned by `func_4`. It identifies the largest and second largest differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list `A` of integers. It then iterates through a list `F` of function complexities, using a binary search approach to find the optimal model complexity from a sorted list `D` of unique model complexities that minimizes the maximum difference between the adjusted model complexities and the largest gap in `A`. Finally, it prints the maximum of the minimized gap and the second largest gap in `A`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases from the function `func_3` and then calls the function `func_6` that many times. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the program is such that `func_6` has been called a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_3`. The side effects of `func_6` and the return value of `func_3` are not specified.
