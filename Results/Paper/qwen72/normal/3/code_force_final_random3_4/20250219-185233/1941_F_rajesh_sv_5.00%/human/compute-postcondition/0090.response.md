Output State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the difference between `h` and `l`, added to `l`. The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged, and `l` is still less than `h`.
