Output State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is now equal to `mid`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to `mid`.
- `l` and `h` are still indices in `D`, and `l` must be less than `h`.
- `mid` remains equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, but since `h` is now `mid`, `mid` will be recalculated based on the new value of `h`.
- `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are still equal to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively, as these values are not affected by the update to `h`.
