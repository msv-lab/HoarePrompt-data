Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `ops` remains unchanged. `vx` has 2 elements left.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing, `p1` will contain the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values from `ops` that were appended because the last element of `p1` did not match the corresponding `v2` value. `p2` will contain any `v1` values from `ops` that were appended because the last element of `p1` did match the corresponding `v2` value. The list `ops` will remain unchanged, and `vx` will have exactly 2 elements left.
