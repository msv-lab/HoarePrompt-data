Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`**

Explanation:
- The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` assigns the values returned by the function `q` to `v1` and `v2`.
- `len(vx) - 2` calculates the length of the set `vx` and subtracts 2 from it. Since `vx` contains integers from 1 to `int(input())`, the length of `vx` is `int(input())`, and `len(vx) - 2` is `int(input()) - 2`.
- The function `q` is called with the argument `int(input()) - 2`, and the values returned by `q` are assigned to `v1` and `v2`.
- The states of the other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `vx`, `ops`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.
