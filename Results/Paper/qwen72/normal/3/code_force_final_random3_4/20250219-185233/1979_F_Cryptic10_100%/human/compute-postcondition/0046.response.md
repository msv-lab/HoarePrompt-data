Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus `v1`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. Additionally, `v2` is less than or equal to 0.***
