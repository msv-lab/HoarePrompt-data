Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `vx` has one element removed, which was `v1`. If `v2` is 0 or less, `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `vx` has two elements removed, the first being `v3` and the second being `v1`, and `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`. `vx` must have at least 3 elements if `v2` > 0, or at least 4 elements if `v2` is 0 or less, to ensure `len(vx) > 2` for the next iteration.**
