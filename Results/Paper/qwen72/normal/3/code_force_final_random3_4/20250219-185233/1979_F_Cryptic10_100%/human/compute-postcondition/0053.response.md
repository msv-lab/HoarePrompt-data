Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus `v1` (and minus `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0), `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` <= 0, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, `vx` no longer contains `v1`.**
