The only variable in the loop head is `vx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `vx`. If the length of `vx` is greater than 2, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `vx` contains more than 2 elements.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is an empty list**
