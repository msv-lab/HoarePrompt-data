Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` is updated to include tuples from the loop operations, `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements, which are the remaining elements after all iterations of the loop, `v1` and `v2` are the last values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the loop condition fails, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` before the loop condition fails.**
