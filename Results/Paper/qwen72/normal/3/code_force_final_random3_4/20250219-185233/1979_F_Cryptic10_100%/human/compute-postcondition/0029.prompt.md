Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1`. `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`, `_` is assigned the second value returned by `q(0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and possibly `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `len(vx)` is now greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and `v3`, `v3` is assigned the value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` is a list that includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and possibly `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v1` and `v2` are now assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `len(vx)` is now greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is a list that includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v3` is assigned the value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` is a list that includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. In the else part, `v1` and `v3` have been removed from `vx`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
