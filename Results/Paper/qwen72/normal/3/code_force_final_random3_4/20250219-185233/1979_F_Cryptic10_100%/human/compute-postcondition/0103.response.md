Output State: **`v3` is assigned the value returned by `q(0)`, `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `v2` > 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` and now also includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. If `v2` is 0 or less, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` and now also includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. `vx` has two elements removed, the first being `v3` and the second being `v1`. `vx` must have at least 2 elements to ensure `len(vx) > 2` for the next iteration.**
