The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` adds a tuple containing the current values of `v1` and `v2` to the list `ops`. This impacts the state of `ops`, which was initially an empty list. The values of `v1` and `v2` are not changed by this operation, and the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus `v1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and the current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**
