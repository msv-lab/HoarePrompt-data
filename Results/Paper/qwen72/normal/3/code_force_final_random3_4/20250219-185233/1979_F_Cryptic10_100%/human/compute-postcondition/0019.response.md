Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and `v3`, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v3` is assigned the value returned by `q(0)`, `len(vx)` is now greater than 1, `ops` is a list that includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.**
