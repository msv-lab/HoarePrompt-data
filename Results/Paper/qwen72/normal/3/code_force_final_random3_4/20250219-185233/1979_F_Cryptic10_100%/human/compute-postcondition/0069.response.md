The objects in the loop head are `v1`, `v2`, and `ops`. The loop will execute based on the state of `ops` and the iteration over its reversed list. For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `v1` and `v2` will take the values of the elements in the tuples as the loop iterates.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `ops` is not empty for the loop to execute. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, and `vx`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list**
