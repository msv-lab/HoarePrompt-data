To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(i \leq \text{isqrt}(x)\), where `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`.
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` is a large integer, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `n` is an integer within the range of `x`.
   - `i` is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`. For example, if `x` is 16, then `i` would be 4 because \(4^2 = 16\).
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Determining `ans`:**
   - To find `ans`, we need to iterate through the divisors of `x` starting from the largest possible divisor and moving downwards until we find a divisor that is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - The largest divisor of `x` is `x` itself, followed by `x/2`, `x/3`, etc., down to 1.
   - The value of `ans` will be the first divisor of `x` that we encounter which is greater than or equal to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is greater than or equal to n)**
