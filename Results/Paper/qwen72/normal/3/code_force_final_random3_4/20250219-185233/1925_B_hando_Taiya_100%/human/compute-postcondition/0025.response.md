The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `n`. `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x. The function returns a value based on these parameters.

Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return some value based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `n`, where `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a value based on these parameters.**
