Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is the largest integer such that `i` ≤ `isqrt(x)`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive). This is because the loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
- For each `i`, the loop checks if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
- If `x` is divisible by `i`, the loop then checks two conditions:
  1. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`.
  2. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches the integer square root of `x`.
- After the loop finishes, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` will remain 0.

Thus, the final output state is as described above.
