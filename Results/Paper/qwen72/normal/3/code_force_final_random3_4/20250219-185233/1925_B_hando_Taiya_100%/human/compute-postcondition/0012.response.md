The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `i`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially 0, and `i` is 2. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to 2, as 2 is greater than 0.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 2, `ans` is 2.**
