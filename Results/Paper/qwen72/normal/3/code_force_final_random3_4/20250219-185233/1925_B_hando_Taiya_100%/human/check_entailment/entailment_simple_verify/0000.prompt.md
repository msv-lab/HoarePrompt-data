You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is the largest integer such that `i` ≤ `isqrt(x)`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.
    #
    #Output:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not correctly compute the maximum balance for certain inputs. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
12 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
For the input `x = 12` and `n = 4`, the optimal way to break up the problem is to have sub-problems with difficulties `[3, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a balance of `3` (since the GCD of `[3, 3, 3, 3]` is `3`). However, the program outputs `4`, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of the loop where the program checks for divisors of `x`. It should ensure that the divisor `i` and its corresponding quotient `x // i` are both valid candidates for the maximum balance, but it does not correctly handle the case where `n` is a divisor of `x` and the quotient is also a valid candidate.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` and also check if `n` itself is a valid divisor. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    if n > 1 and x % n == 0:
        ans = max(ans, x // n)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program checks if `n` is a valid divisor of `x` and updates the answer accordingly.
