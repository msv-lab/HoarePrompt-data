Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `i`, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i` (i.e., `n <= x // i`).**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and the value of `i` (1). Since `i` is 1, `ans` becomes 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
