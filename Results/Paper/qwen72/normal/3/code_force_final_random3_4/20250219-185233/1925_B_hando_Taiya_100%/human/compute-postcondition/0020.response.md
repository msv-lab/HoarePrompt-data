Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^8.
- The value of `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to `x`.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`. The previous value of `ans` was the maximum of `x // 2` (if `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`) and 3, provided that `n` is less than or equal to `x // 3`. If `n` is greater than `x // 3`, `ans` was `x // 2` if `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, otherwise `ans` was 0. Now, `ans` is the maximum of these values and `x // 3`.
