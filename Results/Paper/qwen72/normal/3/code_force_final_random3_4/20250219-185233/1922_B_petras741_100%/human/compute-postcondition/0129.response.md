Output State: **`j` is 1, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `n` remains unchanged, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]]`, `res` is equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * q[eta[0]]`**

Explanation: The value of `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]` to its current value. Since `j` is 1, `rho` is now equal to `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
