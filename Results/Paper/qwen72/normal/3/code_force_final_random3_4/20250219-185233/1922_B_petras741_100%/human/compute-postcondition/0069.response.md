The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` 2, and `n` must still be greater than 0 to ensure that `j` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `q[0]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list that now includes 0 and 1. Otherwise, `eta` is a list that now includes 1.**
