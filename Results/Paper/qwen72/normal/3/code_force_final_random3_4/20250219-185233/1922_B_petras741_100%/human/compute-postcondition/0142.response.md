Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `w` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
- `n` is less than 3.
- No changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
- The value `0` is a constant integer and will be printed as is.

### Output:
Output: **0**
