The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `j` is `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `j` needs to start from 0. Additionally, `n` must be at least 0 for `n + 1` to be greater than 0.

State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `eta` is an empty list**
