Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `buffer` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `buffer`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. The sum of `n` over all test cases still does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
