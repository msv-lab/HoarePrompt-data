Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list that includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6**.

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value.
- Since `j` is 1, the new value of `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`.
- All other variables (`n`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`) remain unchanged.
