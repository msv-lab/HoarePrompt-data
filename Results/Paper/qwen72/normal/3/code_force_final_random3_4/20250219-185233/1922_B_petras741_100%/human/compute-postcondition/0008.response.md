The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` of the list `q` by 1. 

- `j` is 0, so `w[j]` is `w[0]`.
- `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
- `w` is a list of integers, and `w[0]` is an integer within the range of valid indices for `q`.

Therefore, the value at the index `w[0]` in `q` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with `q[w[0]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 0.**
