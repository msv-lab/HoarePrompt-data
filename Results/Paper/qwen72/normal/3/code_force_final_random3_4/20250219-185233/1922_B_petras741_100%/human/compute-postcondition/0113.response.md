To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n + 1):`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `j` is the loop index.
   - `n` is the upper bound of the loop range.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 0.
   - `eta` is an empty list if `q[j]` is not greater than 0.
   - `eta` is a list containing `[0]` if `q[j]` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is now 1, `n` must be at least 0 for the loop to continue (because `1 < n + 1`).

4. **Determine the State of `eta`:**
   - The state of `eta` depends on the value of `q[j]` at the start of the next iteration.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` is 1, so we need to consider the value of `q[1]`.
   - If `q[1]` is not greater than 0, `eta` will remain an empty list.
   - If `q[1]` is greater than 0, `eta` will be a list containing `[1]`.

### Final State:
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `eta` is an empty list if `q[1]` is not greater than 0.
- `eta` is a list containing `[1]` if `q[1]` is greater than 0.

State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 0, `eta` is an empty list if `q[1]` is not greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing `[1]` if `q[1]` is greater than 0**
