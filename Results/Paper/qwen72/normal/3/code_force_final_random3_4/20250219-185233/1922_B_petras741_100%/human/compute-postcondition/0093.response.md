Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list that includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` remains `n` and `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of `q[eta[k]]` for all `k` from 0 to `i - 1` + `q[eta[i]])` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.***
