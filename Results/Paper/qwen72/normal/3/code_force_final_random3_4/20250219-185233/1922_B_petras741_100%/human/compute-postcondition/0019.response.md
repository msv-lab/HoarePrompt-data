The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, and if `q[j]` > 0, `eta` is a list containing the integer `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
