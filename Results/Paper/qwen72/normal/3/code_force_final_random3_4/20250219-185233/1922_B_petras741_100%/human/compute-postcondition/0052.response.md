Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` in the range 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, `res` is undefined if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` in the range 0 to `j-1`)` for all `j` in the range 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `n` is less than 3 and no changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `w` is updated to a list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` remain unchanged based on the initial state.
- The new value of `w` is a list of integers derived from the user input, split by spaces and converted to integers.
