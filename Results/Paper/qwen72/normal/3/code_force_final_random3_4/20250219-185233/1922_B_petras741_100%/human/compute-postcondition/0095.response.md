Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is 1.
3. `n` is a new input integer.
4. `w` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
6. `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln`.
7. `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j] > 0`, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`.
8. `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.
9. `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` in the range 0 to `eta_ln - 1`.
10. `res` is undefined if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` in the range 0 to `j-1`)` for all `j` in the range 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.
11. `n` is less than 3.
12. No changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.

### Analysis:
1. Since `n` is less than 3, `n` can be either 1 or 2.
2. `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. Therefore, if `n` is 1, `q` will be `[0, 0]`. If `n` is 2, `q` will be `[0, 0, 0]`.
3. `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j] > 0`. Since `q` is a list of zeros, `eta` will be an empty list.
4. `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, which is 0 because `eta` is empty.
5. `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln`. Since `eta_ln` is 0, `j` will be 0.
6. `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` in the range 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. Since `eta` is empty, `rho` will be 0.
7. `res` is undefined if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` in the range 0 to `j-1`)` for all `j` in the range 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. Since `eta` is empty, `res` is undefined.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(0)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(0)` statement will print the integer 0. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement is simply printing the integer 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
