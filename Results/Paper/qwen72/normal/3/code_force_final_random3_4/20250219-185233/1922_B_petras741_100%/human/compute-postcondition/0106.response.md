Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1**. 

The value of `j` is 2, and the code increments `q[w[j]]` by 1, which means `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `n` and the previous increments to `q[w[0]]` and `q[w[1]]` remain unchanged.
