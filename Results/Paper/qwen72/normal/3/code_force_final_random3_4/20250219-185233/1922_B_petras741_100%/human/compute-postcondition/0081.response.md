Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list that includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * q[eta[0]]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `j` remains 1.
- The list `eta` still includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.
- The value of `eta_ln` must still be greater than 1.
- The value of `rho` remains equal to `q[eta[0]]`.
- The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its previous value. Since `j` is 1, `res` is now equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * q[eta[0]]`.
