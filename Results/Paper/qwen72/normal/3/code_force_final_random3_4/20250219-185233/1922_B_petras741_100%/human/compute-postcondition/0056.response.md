The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
