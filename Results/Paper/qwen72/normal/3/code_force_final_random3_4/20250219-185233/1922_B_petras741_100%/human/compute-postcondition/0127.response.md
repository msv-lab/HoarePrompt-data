Output State: **`j` is 1, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `n` remains unchanged, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is 1.
- `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.
- `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.
- `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` to its previous value, which was `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`. Therefore, the new value of `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`.
