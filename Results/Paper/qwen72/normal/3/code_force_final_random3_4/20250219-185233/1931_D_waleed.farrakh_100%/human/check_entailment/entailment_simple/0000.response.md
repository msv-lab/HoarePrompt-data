### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input from `stdin` and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the following line.
   - It constructs a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Processing in `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`, it increments `count` by the frequency of `(rx, ry)`.
     - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.
   - After processing all elements in `arr`, it appends the final `count` to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints each result.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for determining if a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful is based on the conditions:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
- The program uses the properties of modular arithmetic to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs:
  - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), the pair \((a_i \% x, a_j \% x)\) must satisfy \(a_i \% x + a_j \% x \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\).
  - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), the pair \((a_i \% y, a_j \% y)\) must satisfy \(a_i \% y - a_j \% y \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).
- The program correctly calculates the required pairs and updates the frequency dictionary to count the number of valid pairs.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `x` or `y` is 1, which could lead to all pairs being considered beautiful. However, the problem constraints ensure that \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\), so this is not an issue.
- The program assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking, which is reasonable given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. The input handling and processing are done efficiently and accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
