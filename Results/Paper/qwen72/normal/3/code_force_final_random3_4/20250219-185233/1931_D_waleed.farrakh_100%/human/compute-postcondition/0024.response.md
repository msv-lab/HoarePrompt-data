The only objects in the loop head are the variables `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty list, and `result` was the last element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element, making it a list with at least two elements. The `result` variable will then be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element in the list**
