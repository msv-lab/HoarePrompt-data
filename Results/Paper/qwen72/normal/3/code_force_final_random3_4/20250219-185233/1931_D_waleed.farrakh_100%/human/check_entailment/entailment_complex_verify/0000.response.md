Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is correct. Let's evaluate this claim by breaking down the logic and behavior of both functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, and comparing it to the problem description.

### Function 1: `func_1(test_cases)`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - `freq` is a dictionary to store the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)`, the function initializes `count` to 0.
   - It iterates over each element `a` in the array `arr`.
   - It calculates `rx` and `ry` as follows:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is the non-negative remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`.
     - `ry = a % y` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary:
     - If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
   - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`:
     - If the pair is already in the dictionary, it increments the frequency.
     - If the pair is not in the dictionary, it adds the pair with a frequency of 1.

3. **Finalization**:
   - After processing all elements in `arr`, the function appends `count` to the `results` list.
   - The function returns the `results` list.

### Function 2: `func_2()`

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads all input from `stdin` and splits it into lines.
   - It extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - It initializes `test_cases` as an empty list to store the test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line.
   - It extracts the array `arr` from the following line.
   - It appends the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.

3. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - It calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and stores the results in the `results` list.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints each result in the `results` list.

### Evaluation Based on Annotated Code

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes it into the required format. It ensures that each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Pair Calculation**:
   - In `func_1`, the calculation of `rx` and `ry` is correct. `rx` ensures that the negative remainder is converted to a non-negative remainder, which is necessary for the conditions given in the problem.
   - The use of the `freq` dictionary to count the occurrences of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` is efficient and correct.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs by checking if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before and adding its frequency to `count`.
   - The final `count` for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

4. **Output**:
   - `func_2` correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` is consistent with the problem description and handles all the constraints and edge cases correctly. The use of the frequency dictionary ensures that the program efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs without unnecessary computations.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
