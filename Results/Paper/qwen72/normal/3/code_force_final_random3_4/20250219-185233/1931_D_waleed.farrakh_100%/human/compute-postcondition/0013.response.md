Output State: **`data` is a list of lines from the input, `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` and `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from the line at index 3 of `data`, `x` is the second integer from the line at index 3 of `data`, `y` is the third integer from the line at index 3 of `data`, `arr` is a list of integers from the line at index 4 of `data`.**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the list `test_cases`. Since `test_cases` already contains one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, it now contains two identical tuples. The values of `data`, `t`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
