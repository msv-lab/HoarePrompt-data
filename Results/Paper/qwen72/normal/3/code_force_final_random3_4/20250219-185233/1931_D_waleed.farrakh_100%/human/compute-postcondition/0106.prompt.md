Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and arr is a list of integers of length n, with each element a_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that were already present in `freq` before the current iteration for all elements in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair from the elements of `arr`, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs `(a % x, a % y)` that were encountered before the current element in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq` during the loop, where `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y` for each element `a` in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
