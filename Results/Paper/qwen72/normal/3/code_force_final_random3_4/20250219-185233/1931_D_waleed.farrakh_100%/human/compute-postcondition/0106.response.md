Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least the number of tuples it started with, `results` is a list containing the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`, and `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.**

### Explanation:
- **`test_cases`**: The list `test_cases` remains unchanged in terms of its length and the tuples it contains. Each tuple in `test_cases` still has the same values for `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` as it did initially.
- **`results`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `results` list contains one integer for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each integer in `results` represents the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that were found in the `freq` dictionary before the current element `a` in `arr` was processed, for each tuple.
- **`freq`**: The `freq` dictionary is updated for each tuple in `test_cases`. For each tuple, `freq` contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in the corresponding `arr`. The dictionary is reset for each new tuple in `test_cases`, so it only reflects the pairs and their frequencies for the current tuple being processed.

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has processed all the tuples in `test_cases`.
