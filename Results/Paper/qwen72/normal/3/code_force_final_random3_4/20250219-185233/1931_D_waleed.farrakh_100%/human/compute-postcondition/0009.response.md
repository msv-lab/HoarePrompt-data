Output State: **`data` is a list of lines from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from the line at index 1 of `data`, `x` is the second integer from the line at index 1 of `data`, `y` is the third integer from the line at index 1 of `data`, `arr` is a list of integers from the line at index 2 of `data`.** 

The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 1 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
