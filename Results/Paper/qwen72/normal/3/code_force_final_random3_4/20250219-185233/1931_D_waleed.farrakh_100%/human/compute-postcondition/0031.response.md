Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` remains unchanged.** 

In natural language: The variable `freq` has been updated such that the value associated with the key `current_pair` (which is a tuple of `(a % x, a % y)`) is incremented by 1. The variable `count` remains unchanged. All other variables and their values remain as they were in the initial state.
