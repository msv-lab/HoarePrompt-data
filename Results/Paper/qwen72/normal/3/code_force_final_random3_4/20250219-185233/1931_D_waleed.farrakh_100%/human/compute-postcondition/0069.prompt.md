Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, it is added to `freq` with a value of 1, and `count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`, and `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq` is updated to include the key `current_pair` with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1, and `count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
