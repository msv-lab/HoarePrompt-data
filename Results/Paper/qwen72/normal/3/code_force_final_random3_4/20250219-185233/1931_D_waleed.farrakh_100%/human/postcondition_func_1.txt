The function `func_2` reads input from standard input (stdin), processes it to create a list of test cases, and then passes this list to another function `func_1`. Each test case is a tuple containing four elements: three integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of integers `arr`. After receiving the results from `func_1`, it prints each result to the standard output (stdout). The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, the results from `func_1` have been printed, and the function has completed its execution.
