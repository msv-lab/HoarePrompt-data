### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes it to create a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - The input is read line by line, and the number of test cases `t` is determined from the first line.
   - For each test case, the function correctly parses `n`, `x`, and `y` from the first line of the test case and `arr` from the second line.
   - The function then calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

2. **Processing Test Cases (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which ensures that `rx` is the negative remainder when `a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before in the dictionary `freq`. If it has, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the dictionary `freq` with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - The function appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the list `results`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function `func_2` prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, which is the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the pairs `(a_i, a_j)` that satisfy the conditions:
  - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
- The use of the dictionary `freq` to keep track of the pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and `(rx, ry)` is appropriate and efficient.
- The input and output handling in `func_2` is correct and matches the problem description.
