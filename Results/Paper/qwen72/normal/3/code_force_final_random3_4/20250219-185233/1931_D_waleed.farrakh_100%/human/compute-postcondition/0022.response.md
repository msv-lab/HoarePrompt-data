To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `result` and the list `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of lines from the input.
- `t` is 0.
- `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, which means `test_cases` is an empty list.
- `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`, which means `idx` is 1.
- `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, which is currently an empty list since `test_cases` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Since `results` is currently empty, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty before calling `func_1(test_cases)`. This means `t` must be greater than 0, and `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, which is now a non-empty list.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a non-empty list**
