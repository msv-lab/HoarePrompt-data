Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rx` is calculated using the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- `a` is the first element of `arr`.
- `x` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `freq`, and `count` remain unchanged.
- The value of `rx` is now the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.
