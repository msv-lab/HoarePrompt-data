Output State: **`data` is a list of lines from the input, `t` is 0, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`, `n` is the first integer from the line at index `1 + 2 * (i - 1)` of `data` for each `i` from 1 to `t`, `x` is the second integer from the line at index `1 + 2 * (i - 1)` of `data` for each `i` from 1 to `t`, `y` is the third integer from the line at index `1 + 2 * (i - 1)` of `data` for each `i` from 1 to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers from the line at index `2 + 2 * (i - 1)` of `data` for each `i` from 1 to `t`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The list `test_cases` contains `t` tuples, where each tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is derived from the input `data`.
- The variable `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`, which means it has been incremented by 2 for each iteration of the loop.
- For each tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is the first integer from the corresponding line in `data`, `x` is the second integer, `y` is the third integer, and `arr` is a list of integers from the next line in `data`. The line indices for `n`, `x`, and `y` are `1 + 2 * (i - 1)` and for `arr` are `2 + 2 * (i - 1)`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `t`.
