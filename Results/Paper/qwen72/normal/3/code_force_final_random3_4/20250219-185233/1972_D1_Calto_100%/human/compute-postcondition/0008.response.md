Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1 + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0)`, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` to its previous value.
- `x` is `n - 2`.
- `y` is 4.
- `math.ceil(x / y)` computes the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`.
- `(x % y == 0)` evaluates to 1 if `x` is divisible by `y`, otherwise it evaluates to 0.
- The new value of `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1 + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0)`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
