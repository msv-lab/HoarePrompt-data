### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\), which is correct.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it computes \(x = n - (b^2 - b)\) and \(y = b^2\).
   - It then adds \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) to the count, and an additional 1 if \(x\) is exactly divisible by \(y\).

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The key condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_2` does not directly check this condition. Instead, it seems to be using a derived formula to count the valid pairs.
   - The formula \(x = n - (b^2 - b)\) and \(y = b^2\) is not immediately clear and does not seem to directly relate to the problem's condition.
   - The use of \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) and the additional check for exact divisibility does not align with the problem's requirement.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\). The function should return 1, which it does.
   - For the fourth test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\). The function should return 14, but the logic used in `func_2` does not seem to correctly count these pairs.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem's condition. The formula used and the way the count is incremented do not align with the requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
