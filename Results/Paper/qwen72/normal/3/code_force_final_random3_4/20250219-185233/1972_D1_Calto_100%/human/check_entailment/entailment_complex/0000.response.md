### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is returned as `a` when `b` becomes 0.
   - The function is correct and matches the expected behavior for computing the GCD.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The loop iterates over each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The final result is `cnt - 1`.

4. **Verification of the Logic:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be a valid integer, \(b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\) must be an integer between 1 and \(n\).

5. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code in `func_2` does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not seem to be derived from the problem's conditions.
   - The logic `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
