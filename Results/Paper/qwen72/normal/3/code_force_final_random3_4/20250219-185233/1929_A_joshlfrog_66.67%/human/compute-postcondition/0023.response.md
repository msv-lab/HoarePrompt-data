Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` is the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `e` remains 0.
- The variable `l` is still the input integer that was provided initially.
- The variable `nums` is still the list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `i` is set to `l-1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `nums`.
- The variable `x` is set to the maximum value found in the list `nums`.
- The variable `y` is set to the minimum value found in the list `nums`.
