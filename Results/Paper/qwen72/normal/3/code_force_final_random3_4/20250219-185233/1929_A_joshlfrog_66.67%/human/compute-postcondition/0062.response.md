Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` is 100000000 if `nums[0]` is not less than `y`, otherwise `y` is `nums[0]`, `x` is `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0, `x` is now `nums[1]`.** 

In natural language: The value of `x` is updated to the value of the second element in the list `nums` (i.e., `nums[1]`). The other variables remain unchanged, except for `y` which may have been updated to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` was less than 100000000, and `x` which was previously set to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` was greater than 0, otherwise it was 0. Now, `x` is `nums[1]`.
