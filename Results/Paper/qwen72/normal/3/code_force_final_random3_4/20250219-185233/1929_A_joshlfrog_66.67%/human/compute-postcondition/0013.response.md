The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `l`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `l` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `l` must be greater than 1).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `x` is 0, and if `nums[0]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to the value of `nums[0]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.**
