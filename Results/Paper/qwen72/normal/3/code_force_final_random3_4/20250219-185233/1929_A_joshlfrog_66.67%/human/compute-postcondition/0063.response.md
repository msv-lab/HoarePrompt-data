Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` is 100000000 if `nums[0]` is not less than `y`, otherwise `y` is `nums[0]`, `x` is `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0. If `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.***
