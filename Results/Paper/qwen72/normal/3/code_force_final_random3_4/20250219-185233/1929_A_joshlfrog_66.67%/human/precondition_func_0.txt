The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, n, a):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n.
