Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000.**

The value of `y` is updated to 100000000, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `y` was the minimum value in the new `nums`, but now `y` is explicitly set to 100000000.
