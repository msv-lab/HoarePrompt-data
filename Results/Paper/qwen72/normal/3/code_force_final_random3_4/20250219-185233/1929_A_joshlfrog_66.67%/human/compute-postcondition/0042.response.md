The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `l` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `x` is 0 or `x` is equal to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0, and if `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` (which is `nums[1]`) is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000 if `nums[0]` was less than 100000000, or `y` remains `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` was greater than or equal to 100000000.**
