The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `l`. For the loop to execute, `l` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` is automatically managed by the `range` function, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `l-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `e` is 0
- `l` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 100000000

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `l` to ensure it is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 as it is initialized by the `range` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0**
