Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `b` is greater than `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made. Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, and no changes are made.***
