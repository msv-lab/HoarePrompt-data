Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. Depending on the relationship between `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a specific integer result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` is 0, and `n`, `a`, and `b` hold the values from the last test case. **
