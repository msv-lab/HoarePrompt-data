Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 but one less than it was at the start of the previous iteration.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `t`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `t`.
- Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `t`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are provided by the user.
   - The value of `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
   - The print statement calculates and prints the integer value of the expression \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\).

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `2 * b - n + 1`: This is a linear combination of `b` and `n`.
   - `* n`: This multiplies the result of the previous step by `n`.
   - `// 2`: This performs integer division by 2.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The final value printed will be the integer result of the expression \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\).

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the integer value of the expression \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\). Since the exact values of `b` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) (where `b` and `n` are the values provided by the user)**
