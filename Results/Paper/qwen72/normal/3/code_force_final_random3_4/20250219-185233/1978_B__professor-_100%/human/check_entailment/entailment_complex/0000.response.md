### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any additional benefit. The profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`. The profit in this case is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price. This can be calculated as \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))\).

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output based on the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `b` is equal to `a` or when `b` is much larger than `a`.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function uses efficient mathematical formulas to calculate the profit, which ensures that it can handle large inputs (up to \(10^9\)) within a reasonable time.

### Correctness:
**True**

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering the different cases based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. The calculations and conditions are accurate and match the problem requirements.
