Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 but one less than it was at the start of the previous iteration.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `t`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `t`.
- Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `t`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `b` and `a` are integers provided by the user.
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user.
   - The value of `t` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this calculation.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
   - Let's break it down:
     - `(b - a)`: This is the difference between `b` and `a`.
     - `(b - a + 1)`: This is the difference plus one.
     - `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`: This is the sum of the first `(b - a)` integers, which is a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
     - `a * n`: This is the product of `a` and `n`.
     - `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`: This is the sum of the two parts, converted to an integer.

3. **Conditions and Their Impact:**
   - The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the calculation inside the `print` statement. They only affect the value of `t`, which is not used in the expression.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression \((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n\).

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n) (where `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, and `n` is an integer provided by the user)**
