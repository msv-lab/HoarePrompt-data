Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Case 1: \( b \le a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The program correctly prints \( n \times a \).

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \ge n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
   - The profit for selling the first \( n \) buns at modified prices is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (b - i + 1) \).
   - The program correctly prints \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is less than the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price.
   - The profit for selling the first \( b - a \) buns at modified prices is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \sum_{i=1}^{b-a} (b - i + 1) \).
   - The profit for selling the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price is \( (n - (b - a)) \times a \).
   - The program correctly prints \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \).

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, ensuring that the maximum profit is calculated for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
