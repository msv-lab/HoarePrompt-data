You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. Depending on the relationship between `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a specific integer result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` is 0, and `n`, `a`, and `b` hold the values from the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `b - i + 1` coins.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks three conditions to determine the maximum profit:
     - **Condition 1:** If `b <= a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price is not beneficial. The profit is `n * a`.
     - **Condition 2:** If `b - a >= n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price because the modified price is always higher than the usual price for all buns. The profit is the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, which is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
     - **Condition 3:** If neither of the above conditions is true, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. The profit is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series plus the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price, which is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `b <= a`, the profit is `n * a`. This is correct because selling at the usual price is the best option.
   - **Condition 2:** If `b - a >= n`, the profit is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`. This is the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, which is correct.
   - **Condition 3:** If `b - a < n`, the profit is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`. This is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series plus the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price, which is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `b` is very large or very small relative to `a` and `n`.
   - The arithmetic series sum formula is correctly applied in all cases.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program outputs the correct profit for each test case based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. It handles all the given conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
