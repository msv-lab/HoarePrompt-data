### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Logic for Maximum Profit**:
   - **Case 1**: If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not more beneficial than the usual price. Therefore, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`, resulting in a profit of `n * a`.
   - **Case 2**: If `b - a >= n`, it means the modified price sequence can cover all buns. In this case, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price, which forms an arithmetic sequence from `b` to `b - n + 1`. The sum of this sequence is given by the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence: \(\frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2}\).
   - **Case 3**: If `b - a < n`, it means the modified price sequence can only cover the first `b - a` buns. The profit from these buns is the sum of the arithmetic sequence from `b` to `a + 1`, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\). The remaining `n - (b - a)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `a * (n - (b - a))` to the profit. The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- The function correctly handles the input for multiple test cases.
- The logic for determining the maximum profit is correct:
  - **Case 1**: When `b <= a`, the profit is `n * a`, which is the correct calculation.
  - **Case 2**: When `b - a >= n`, the profit is \(\frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2}\), which is the correct sum of the arithmetic sequence.
  - **Case 3**: When `b - a < n`, the profit is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))\), which correctly combines the profit from the modified price sequence and the usual price.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering the given constraints and conditions.
