Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime_to_i * prime`, `factor` is the next element from `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be a non-negative integer, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, `_` is incremented by 1, `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than the new value of `_`**

The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` causes the value `factor * prime_to_i` to be yielded. This means that the value `factor * prime_to_i` is returned to the caller, and the state of the generator is paused. The values of `k`, `rest`, `prime`, `prime_to_i`, `factor`, `factors[prime]`, and `_` remain unchanged, except for the fact that `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded. The condition that `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than the new value of `_` still holds.
