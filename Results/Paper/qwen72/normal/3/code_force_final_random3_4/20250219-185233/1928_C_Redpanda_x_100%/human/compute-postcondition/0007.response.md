The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `factors[prime] + 1`. To ensure the loop executes, the expression `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than 0. This means `factors[prime]` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `prime_to_i` is 1

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `factors[prime]` is at least 0. Since `prime` is `primes[k]`, we need to ensure that `factors[prime]` is non-negative.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0**
