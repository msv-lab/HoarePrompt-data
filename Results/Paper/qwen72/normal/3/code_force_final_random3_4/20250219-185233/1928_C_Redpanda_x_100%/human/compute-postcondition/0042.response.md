Postcondition: **k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where primes is a list of prime numbers. If k is equal to the length of the primes list, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and all possible products of each `factor` in `rest` with each power of `prime` from 1 up to `primes[k]` raised to the power of `factors[prime]` have been yielded.**
