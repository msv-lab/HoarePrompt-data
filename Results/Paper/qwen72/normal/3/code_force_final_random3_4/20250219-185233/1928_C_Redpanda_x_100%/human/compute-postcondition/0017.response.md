The only objects in the loop head are `factor` and `rest`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `rest`. For the loop to execute one more time, `rest` must still be a non-empty iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable. For the next iteration, the next `factor` will be taken from `rest`.

Since `rest` is a non-empty iterable at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `rest` must still have at least one more element. The state of `factor` will be the next element from `rest`.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`, `factor` is the next element from `rest`**
