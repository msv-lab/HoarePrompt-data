The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least three elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least two elements, and `x` is the second element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three elements, and `x` will be the third element in `a`.

State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `a`**
