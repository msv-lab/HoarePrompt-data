To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for x in cnt.values():
```

The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `cnt`. The loop will execute again if there are more values in `cnt.values()` to iterate over.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - `ans` is `0 + x // 4 + x // 4`
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
   - `cnt` must have at least two values.
   - `x` is the second value in `cnt.values()`.

2. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop will execute again if there is a third value in `cnt.values()`.
   - After the previous iteration, `x` was the second value in `cnt.values()`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the third value in `cnt.values()`.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `cnt` must have at least three values for the loop to execute again.
   - `x` will be the third value in `cnt.values()`.

### Final State:
State: **`ans` is `0 + x // 4 + x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `cnt` must have at least three values, `x` is the third value in `cnt.values()`**
