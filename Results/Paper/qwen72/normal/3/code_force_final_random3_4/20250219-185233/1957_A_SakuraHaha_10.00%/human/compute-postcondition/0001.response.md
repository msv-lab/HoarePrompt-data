Output State: **The function should take a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. Each test case list should be structured as [n, [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]], with 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100. `n` is an input integer. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, but this code snippet does not affect `n` directly.
- The initial state also specifies the structure and constraints of the test cases, which remain unchanged.
- After executing the code, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and the rest of the initial state remains valid.
