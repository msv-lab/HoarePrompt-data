The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases. Each test case is a list containing an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. The structure of each test case is [n, [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]], where 1 <= t <= 100 (t is the number of test cases), 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.

The function returns a list of results for each test case. For each test case:
- Case_1: If the list of stick lengths contains at least three sticks that can form a triangle, the function returns "Yes" for that test case.
- Case_2: If no such combination of three sticks can form a triangle, the function returns "No" for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if the sticks in the corresponding test case can form a triangle, and "No" otherwise.**
