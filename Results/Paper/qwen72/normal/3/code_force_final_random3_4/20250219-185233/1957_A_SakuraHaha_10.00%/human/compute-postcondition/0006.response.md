The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a`, and `x` takes the value of each element in `a` one by one. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the first element in `a`, and `a` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two elements, and `x` will be the second element in `a`.

State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `a`**
