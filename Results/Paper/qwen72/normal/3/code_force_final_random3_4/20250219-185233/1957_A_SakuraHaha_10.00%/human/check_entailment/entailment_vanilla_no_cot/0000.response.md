Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it only considers the possibility of forming squares (4-sided polygons) and does not account for the possibility of forming other regular polygons (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.). The problem statement requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons, not just squares.

For example, in the test case:
```
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```
The program will output `0` because it only checks for the number of sticks that can form squares. However, the correct output should be `1` because you can form a regular hexagon with the 6 sticks of length 3.

To fix this, the program should consider all possible regular polygons, not just squares. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        for sides in range(3, 101):  # Check for polygons with 3 to 100 sides
            ans += x // sides
    print(ans)
```

This version of the program will correctly count the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, considering polygons with 3 to 100 sides.
