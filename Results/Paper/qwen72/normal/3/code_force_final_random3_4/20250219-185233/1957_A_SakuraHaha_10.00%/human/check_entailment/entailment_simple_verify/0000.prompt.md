You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n followed by a list of n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. Each test case list should be structured as [n, [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]], with 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for each value `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` remains a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of `x // 4` for each value `x` in `cnt.values()`.
    #   - Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of `x // 4` for each count `x` in `cnt`.
    #
    #Output:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons with sides other than 4. The problem description specifies that we need to find the maximum number of regular polygons (which can have any number of sides, not just 4) that can be constructed from the given sticks. However, the program only counts the number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed, which is incorrect. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```

The correct output should be 1, as we can form a square using the four sticks of length 3. However, the program will output 0 because it only checks for the possibility of forming squares and does not consider other regular polygons like triangles or pentagons.
