You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. For each test case, the function computes and prints a value based on the following conditions: If `n` is odd, it prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even, it prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b`. The function processes up to `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than twice the regular price `a`, but the number of yogurts `n` is odd. In such a case, the program incorrectly adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price `a` after buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price. This can lead to a higher total cost than necessary.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 5 8
```
- The program will calculate the cost as follows:
  - `n` is odd, so it will buy one yogurt at the regular price `a` and the remaining two yogurts at the promotion price `b`.
  - The total cost will be `1 * 5 + 1 * 8 = 13`.

However, the correct minimum cost should be:
- Buy one yogurt at the regular price `a` and the remaining two yogurts at the promotion price `b`.
- The total cost should be `1 * 5 + 1 * 8 = 13`.

But if we consider another example:
```
1
3 5 7
```
- The program will calculate the cost as follows:
  - `n` is odd, so it will buy one yogurt at the regular price `a` and the remaining two yogurts at the promotion price `b`.
  - The total cost will be `1 * 5 + 1 * 7 = 12`.

However, the correct minimum cost should be:
- Buy all three yogurts at the regular price `a` because `2 * a < b` is not true.
- The total cost should be `3 * 5 = 15`.

The program incorrectly adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price `a` after buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price, which can lead to a higher total cost than necessary.
