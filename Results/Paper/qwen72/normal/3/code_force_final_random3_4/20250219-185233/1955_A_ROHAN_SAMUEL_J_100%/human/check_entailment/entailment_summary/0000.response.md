### Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`):**
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means that buying each yogurt individually is cheaper than buying them in pairs at the promotional price. Therefore, the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buy one additional yogurt at the regular price. The total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`):**
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means that buying each yogurt individually is cheaper than buying them in pairs at the promotional price. Therefore, the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The total cost is `n // 2 * b`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Odd Case:** The program correctly handles the odd case by checking if buying each yogurt individually is cheaper (`2 * a < b`). If it is, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`, which correctly accounts for the cost of the pairs and the single yogurt.
- **Even Case:** The program correctly handles the even case by checking if buying each yogurt individually is cheaper (`2 * a < b`). If it is, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b`, which correctly accounts for the cost of all pairs.
- **Output:** The program prints the correct minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Example:
- **Test Case 1: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program prints `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program prints `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program prints `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 4: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program prints `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. It handles both odd and even cases appropriately and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
