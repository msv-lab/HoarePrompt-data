### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided function summary and the original assessment.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func` processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `n` is odd:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`.
- If `n` is even:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than twice the regular price `a`, but the number of yogurts `n` is odd. Specifically, it claims that the program incorrectly adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price `a` after buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price, which can lead to a higher total cost than necessary.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `n` is even**
   - If `2 * a < b`, the program prints `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `n // 2 * b`.
   - This is correct because for an even number of yogurts, the minimum cost is either buying all yogurts at the regular price or buying them in pairs at the promotion price, whichever is cheaper.

2. **Case 2: `n` is odd**
   - If `2 * a < b`, the program prints `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - This is also correct because for an odd number of yogurts, the minimum cost is either buying all yogurts at the regular price or buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price, whichever is cheaper.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the examples provided in the original assessment:

1. **Example 1: `3 5 8`**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a` is `10` and `b` is `8`.
   - Since `2 * a > b`, the program prints `n // 2 * b + a` which is `1 * 8 + 5 = 13`.
   - The correct minimum cost is indeed `13` because buying one yogurt at the regular price and two at the promotion price is cheaper than buying all three at the regular price.

2. **Example 2: `3 5 7`**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a` is `10` and `b` is `7`.
   - Since `2 * a > b`, the program prints `n // 2 * b + a` which is `1 * 7 + 5 = 12`.
   - The correct minimum cost is indeed `12` because buying one yogurt at the regular price and two at the promotion price is cheaper than buying all three at the regular price.

3. **Example 3: `3 5 11`**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a` is `10` and `b` is `11`.
   - Since `2 * a < b`, the program prints `a * n` which is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - The correct minimum cost is indeed `15` because buying all three yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price and one at the regular price.

4. **Example 4: `4 5 11`**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a` is `10` and `b` is `11`.
   - Since `2 * a < b`, the program prints `a * n` which is `4 * 5 = 20`.
   - The correct minimum cost is indeed `20` because buying all four yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two pairs at the promotion price.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both even and odd values of `n` and computes the minimum cost based on the given conditions. The original assessment's claim that the program incorrectly adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price after buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price is not accurate. The program's logic is correct and matches the expected behavior for all provided examples.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
