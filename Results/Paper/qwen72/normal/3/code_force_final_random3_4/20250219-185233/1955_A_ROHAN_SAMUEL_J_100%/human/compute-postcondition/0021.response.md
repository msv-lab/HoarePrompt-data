Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
   - `_` is 1.
   - The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
   - If `n` is odd, then:
     - If \(2 \times a < b\), the condition \(2 \times a < b\) holds.
     - Otherwise, the condition \(2 \times a \geq b\) holds.
   - If `n` is even, then:
     - If \(2 \times a < b\), the current value of \(2 \times a\) is less than the current value of `b`.
     - Otherwise, \(2 \times a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n // 2 * b)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, which means it will return the largest integer less than or equal to the result of \( \frac{n}{2} \).
   - The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Regardless of whether `n` is odd or even, the expression `n // 2` will always yield an integer.
   - If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \).
   - If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be \( \frac{n - 1}{2} \).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value printed will be the result of `n // 2 * b`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the product of the integer division of `n` by 2 and the value of `b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is the value of n and b is the value of b)**
