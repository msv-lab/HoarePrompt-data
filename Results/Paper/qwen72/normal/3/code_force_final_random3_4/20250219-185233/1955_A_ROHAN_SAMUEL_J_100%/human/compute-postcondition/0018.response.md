To determine what will be printed by the `print(n // 2 * b + a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `n` is odd:
     - If \(2 \times a < b\), the condition \(2 \times a < b\) holds.
     - Otherwise, the condition \(2 \times a \geq b\) holds.
   - If `n` is even:
     - If \(2 \times a < b\), the current value of \(2 \times a\) is less than the current value of \(b\).
     - Otherwise, \(2 \times a\) is greater than or equal to \(b\).

3. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `n // 2 * b + a`.

Let's analyze the expression step by step:

- `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2. This means:
  - If `n` is even, `n // 2` is exactly half of `n`.
  - If `n` is odd, `n // 2` is \((n - 1) / 2\).

- The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

- Finally, `a` is added to the result of the multiplication.

Given the conditions, the value of `n // 2 * b + a` will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the conditions provided do not directly affect the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`. They only describe the relationship between `a` and `b` based on whether `n` is odd or even.

Let's summarize the output:

- If `n` is even, `n // 2` is \(n / 2\).
- If `n` is odd, `n // 2` is \((n - 1) / 2\).

The final expression `n // 2 * b + a` will be evaluated based on these values.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n is the value of n, a is the value of a, and b is the value of b)**

This output is the most precise description possible based on the given initial state and conditions.
