Let's break down the initial state and the code to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
   - `_` is 2.
   - The input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` must be greater than 1.
   - If `n` is odd, the condition \(2 * a < b\) holds if \(2 * a < b\); otherwise, the condition \(2 * a \geq b\) holds.
   - If `n` is even, the condition \(2 * a < b\) holds if \(2 * a < b\); otherwise, the condition \(2 * a \geq b\) holds.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * n)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet `print(a * n)` will print the product of `a` and `n`.
   - The values of `a` and `n` are provided by the input and must be greater than 1.
   - The conditions involving `b` do not affect the value of `a * n` directly, but they ensure that the values of `a` and `b` are consistent with the given constraints.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `a` and `n` are both integers greater than 1, the product `a * n` will be an integer greater than 1.
   - The exact value of `a * n` depends on the specific values of `a` and `n` provided by the input.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are integers greater than 1 provided by the input)**
