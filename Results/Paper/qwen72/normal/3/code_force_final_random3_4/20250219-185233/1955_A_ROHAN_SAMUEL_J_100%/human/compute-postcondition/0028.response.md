Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input, and `_` is 2. The input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` must be greater than 1. If `2 * a < b`, the condition 2 * a < b holds. Otherwise, the condition 2 * a >= b holds.***
