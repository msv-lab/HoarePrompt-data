Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The loop variable `_` is `t - 1`. For each test case, if `n` is odd, then if 2 * a < b, the value `a * n` was printed; otherwise, the value `n // 2 * b + a` was printed. If `n` is even, then if 2 * a < b, the value `a * n` was printed; otherwise, the value `n // 2 * b` was printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- After all iterations, the loop variable `_` will be `t - 1` because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.
- For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input.
- Depending on whether `n` is odd or even, and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`, the appropriate value is printed.
- The conditions and the printed values for each test case are as described in the initial and intermediate output states.
