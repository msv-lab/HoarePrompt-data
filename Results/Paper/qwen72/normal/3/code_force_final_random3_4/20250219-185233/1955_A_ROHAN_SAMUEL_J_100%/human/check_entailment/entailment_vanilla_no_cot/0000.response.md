Correctness: **True**

The program correctly handles the problem by considering the cost of buying yogurts both individually and in pairs at the promotional price. It checks if the number of yogurts `n` is odd or even and then calculates the minimum cost accordingly:

1. If `n` is odd:
   - It checks if buying two yogurts individually (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotional price (b).
   - If 2 * a is cheaper, it buys all yogurts individually.
   - If b is cheaper, it buys as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and one yogurt individually.

2. If `n` is even:
   - It checks if buying two yogurts individually (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotional price (b).
   - If 2 * a is cheaper, it buys all yogurts individually.
   - If b is cheaper, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements, ensuring the minimum cost is calculated for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
