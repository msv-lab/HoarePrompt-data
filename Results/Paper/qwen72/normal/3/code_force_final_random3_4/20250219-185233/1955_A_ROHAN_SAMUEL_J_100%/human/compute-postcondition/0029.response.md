To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
   - `_` is 2.
   - The input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` must be greater than 1.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `n` is odd:
     - The condition \(2 \times a < b\) holds if \(2 \times a < b\).
     - Otherwise, the condition \(2 \times a \geq b\) holds.
   - If `n` is even:
     - The condition \(2 \times a < b\) holds if \(2 \times a < b\).
     - Otherwise, the condition \(2 \times a \geq b\) holds.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(a * n)` will print the product of `a` and `n`.

Given the conditions, the value of `a * n` depends on the values of `n` and `a` provided by the input. However, the conditions do not change the values of `a` or `n` directly; they only provide constraints on the relationship between `a` and `b`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **a * n (where `a` and `n` are the input values, and `n` is greater than 1, `a` is greater than 1, and the conditions on `a` and `b` are satisfied based on whether `n` is odd or even)**
