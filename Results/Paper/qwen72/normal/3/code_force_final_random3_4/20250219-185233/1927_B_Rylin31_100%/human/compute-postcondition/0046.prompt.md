Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user; `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 1 and all other elements still initialized to 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element; `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`; `j` is the first element in `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 2 and all other elements still initialized to 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements; `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the new ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`; `j` is the second element in `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by the length of `array`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 3 and all other elements still initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the new ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` after the first increment, and then followed by the character corresponding to the new ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` after the second increment, and finally followed by the character corresponding to the new ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` after the third increment, `j` is the third element in `array`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
