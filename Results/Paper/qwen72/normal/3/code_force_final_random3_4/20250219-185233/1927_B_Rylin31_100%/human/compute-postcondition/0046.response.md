Output State: **`i` is incremented by the length of `array`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with the elements at the indices specified by `array` incremented by the number of times each index appears in `array`, and all other elements still initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the elements in `s` at the indices specified by `array` plus 97, concatenated in the order the indices appear in `array`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be incremented by the length of `array`. This means `i` will be equal to its initial value plus the number of elements in `array`.
- **`l`**: The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The list `s` will have its elements at the indices specified by `array` incremented by the number of times each index appears in `array`. For example, if `array` is `[0, 1, 0, 2]`, then `s[0]` will be incremented by 2, `s[1]` by 1, and `s[2]` by 1. All other elements in `s` that are not referenced in `array` will remain 0.
- **`array`**: The list `array` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The string `ans` will contain characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the elements in `s` at the indices specified by `array`, plus 97. These characters are concatenated in the order the indices appear in `array`. For example, if `array` is `[0, 1, 0, 2]` and `s` is initially `[0, 0, 0]`, after the loop `ans` will be `'a' + 'a' + 'b' + 'a' + 'c'`, which is `'aaabc'`.
