The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `array`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `array`. If `array` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `j` will take the value of the first element in `array` during the first iteration.

State: **`i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element; `ans` is an empty string; `j` is the first element in `array`**
