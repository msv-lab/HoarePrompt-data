The value of `s[j]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is the third element of `array`, and `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at index `j` is 2 and all other elements are 0, after the increment, the element at index `j` in `s` will be 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at index `j` is 3 and all other elements are 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least three elements, `j` is the third element of `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table, and `ans` is now extended by the character 'c'.**
