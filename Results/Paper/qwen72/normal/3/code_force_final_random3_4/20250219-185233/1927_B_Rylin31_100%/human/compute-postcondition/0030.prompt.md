Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is the first element of `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least two elements, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` and now also contains the character 'b', `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is the second element of `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except `s[j]` which is 3, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least three elements, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` and now also contains the character 'b' and the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is the third element of `array`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
