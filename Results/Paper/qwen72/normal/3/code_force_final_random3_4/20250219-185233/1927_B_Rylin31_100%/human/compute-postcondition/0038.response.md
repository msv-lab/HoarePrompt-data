Output State: **`i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element; `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`; `j` is the first element in `array`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`. Since `s` is a list of zeros, `s[j]` is 0, so `ans` will contain the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `97` (which is 'a').
- The other variables (`i`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `j`) remain unchanged, but the new value of `ans` is now a string containing the character 'a'.
