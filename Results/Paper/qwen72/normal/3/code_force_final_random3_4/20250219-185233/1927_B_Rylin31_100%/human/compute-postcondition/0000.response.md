To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is used as the loop counter and is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.
2. **Input Value**: The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- For each test case, a valid string s exists

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value. The loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, and the input value must be greater than 0**
