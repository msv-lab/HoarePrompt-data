### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string, `l`, and the trace array, `array`, using `int(input())` and `list(map(int, input().split()))` respectively.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array `s` is used to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the resulting string.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program iterates over the trace array `array`.
   - For each element `j` in the trace array, it appends the character corresponding to `s[j]` to the result string `ans`.
   - The character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`, where `97` is the ASCII value of 'a'. This means that if `s[j]` is 0, the character 'a' is appended, if `s[j]` is 1, the character 'b' is appended, and so on.
   - After appending the character, it increments `s[j]` by 1 to update the count of occurrences for that character.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the string for each test case, it prints the result string `ans`.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
  - For each test case, a valid string `s` exists.

- **State after reading the number of test cases:**
  - The loop will run `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

- **State after reading the length of the string and initializing `s`:**
  - `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `s` is a list of length `l` initialized to 0.

- **State after reading the trace array:**
  - `array` is a list of `l` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < l.

- **State during the construction of the string:**
  - For each element `j` in `array`, the program appends the character corresponding to `s[j]` to `ans`.
  - The character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`, ensuring that the characters are from 'a' to 'z'.
  - `s[j]` is incremented by 1 after appending the character, correctly updating the count of occurrences for that character.

- **State after the loop for each test case:**
  - The result string `ans` is printed, which is constructed based on the trace array and the counts in `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The logic for constructing the string `ans` from the trace array `array` is sound, and the use of `chr(s[j] + 97)` ensures that the characters are from the lowercase Latin letters 'a' to 'z'. The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
