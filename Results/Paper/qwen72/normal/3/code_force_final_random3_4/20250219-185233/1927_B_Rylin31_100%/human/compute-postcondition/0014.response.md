Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at each index `j` in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`, and all other elements are 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element; `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases still does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- The list `s` is now a list of length `l` where each element at an index `j` (where `j` is an element in `array`) is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`. All other elements in `s` remain 0.
- The variable `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element.
- The string `ans` is constructed by appending the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`. This means that for each index `j` in `array`, the character corresponding to the ASCII value `s[j] + 97` is added to `ans`.
