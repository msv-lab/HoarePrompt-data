Output State: **The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. `A` is either the opposite of its previous value if `not_c` is True, or remains unchanged if `not_c` is False. `not_c` is True if no two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise it is False.**
