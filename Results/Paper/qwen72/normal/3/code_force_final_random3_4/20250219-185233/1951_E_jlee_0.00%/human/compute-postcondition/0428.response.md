Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s`, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`), `done` is False, `count2` is the count of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first mismatch (or 0 if no such characters exist).**
