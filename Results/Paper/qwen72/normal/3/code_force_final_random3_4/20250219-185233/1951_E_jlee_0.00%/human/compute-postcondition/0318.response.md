The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
