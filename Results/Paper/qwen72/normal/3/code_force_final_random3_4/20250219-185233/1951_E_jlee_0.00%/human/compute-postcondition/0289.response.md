Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `count` is 0 or greater than 0. If `done` is True, the loop has encountered a condition where it printed 'YES' and the appropriate number (1 or 2) along with the `string` or a split of the `string` and then broke out of the loop. If `done` is False, the loop has completed all iterations without encountering such a condition, and `count` and `count2` will have values based on the number of times `s[j]` was not equal to `x` and the conditions checked within the loop.***
