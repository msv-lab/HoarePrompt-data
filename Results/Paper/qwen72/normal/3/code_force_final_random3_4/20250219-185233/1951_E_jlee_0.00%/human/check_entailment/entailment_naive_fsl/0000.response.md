Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings but does not satisfy the specific conditions checked in the program. For example, consider the input string "abbaabba". The string is a palindrome, but it can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings "abba" and "abba". However, the program will output "NO" for this case, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The program should be able to find a valid partition even if the entire string is a palindrome, as long as it can be divided into non-palindromic parts.
