Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 2, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is 0 or 1. If `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` â‰¤ 1, `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` was initially 1; otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 or 1, and `done` remains False.***
