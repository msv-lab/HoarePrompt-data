Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`. If `n` is 1, `done` remains False and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. Otherwise, `done` remains False. The first character of `s` (`x`) is not equal to the last character of `s`.**
