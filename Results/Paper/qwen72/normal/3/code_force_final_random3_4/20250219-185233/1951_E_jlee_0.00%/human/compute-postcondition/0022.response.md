Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `done` remains False. `n` is an odd number, and the middle character of `s` (i.e., `s[(n - 1) // 2]`) is not equal to `x`. The current value of `s.count(x)` is `n - 1`.**
