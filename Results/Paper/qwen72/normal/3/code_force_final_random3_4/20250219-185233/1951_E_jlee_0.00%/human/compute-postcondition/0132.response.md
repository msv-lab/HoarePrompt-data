Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is set to 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `count2` is 0.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of all variables remains unchanged.
