Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string and determines if it can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are not the same. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts (1 or 2) and the substrings. If not, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the program state is undefined as the function does not modify any global variables or return any values. **
