Output State: **`i` is 29, `length` is 30, `s[29]` is '1'**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '1'` assigns the character '1' to the 29th index of the string or list `s`. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s[29]` and the unchanged values of `i` and `length`.
