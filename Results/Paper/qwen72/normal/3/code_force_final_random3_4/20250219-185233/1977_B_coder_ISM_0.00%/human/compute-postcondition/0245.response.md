Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `nalla` is 1.
2. `t` is greater than 1.
3. `i` is 29.
4. `length` is 30.
5. `x` is an input integer.
6. `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29).
7. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'.
8. If none of these conditions were met, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.
9. Additionally, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(length)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `length` is explicitly given as 30 in the initial state.
- The `print(length)` statement will simply print the value of `length`.

### Output:
Output: **30**
