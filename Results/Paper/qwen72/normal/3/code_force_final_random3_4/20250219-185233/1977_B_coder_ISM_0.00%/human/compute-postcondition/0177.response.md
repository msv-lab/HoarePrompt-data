The code snippet `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the end of the list `s`. This impacts the length of `s` and the value of its last element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 31 elements, the last element of `s` is '0'.**
