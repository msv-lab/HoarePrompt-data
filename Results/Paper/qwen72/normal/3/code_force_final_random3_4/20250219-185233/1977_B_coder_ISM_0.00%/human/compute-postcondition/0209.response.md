Postcondition: ***`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29). If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` was '0', the element at index `i` in `s` remains '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and `s[i + 1]` was '1', then `flag` is set to 1, `s[i]` is set to '-1', and `s[i + 1]` is set to '1'. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. If `flag` is 0, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.***
