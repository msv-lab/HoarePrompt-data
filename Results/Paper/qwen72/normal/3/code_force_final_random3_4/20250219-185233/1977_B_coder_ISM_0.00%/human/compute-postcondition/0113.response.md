Postcondition: **`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing a bit of `x` from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
