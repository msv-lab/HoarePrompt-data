The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is `30`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `30`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `length` is 30. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `length` remains 30.

State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `1` results in a non-zero value, `s` is a list that now contains the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list that has been appended with the string '0'.**
