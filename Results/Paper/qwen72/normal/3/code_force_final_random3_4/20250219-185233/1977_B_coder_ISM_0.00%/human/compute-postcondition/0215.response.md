Output State: **`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29), and `s[2]` is set to '-1'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[2]` was '0', then `flag` is 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
