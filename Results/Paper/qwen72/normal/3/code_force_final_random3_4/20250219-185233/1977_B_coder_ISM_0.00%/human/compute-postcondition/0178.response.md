Postcondition: ***`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list with 31 elements. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1, the last element of `s` is '1', and the second last element of `s` is '1' if the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0, the last element of `s` is '0', and the second last element of `s` is '0'. The loop has processed all elements from index 1 to 30.***
