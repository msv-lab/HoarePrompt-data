Postcondition: **`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29), and `flag` is 0. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '0', the element at index `i` in `s` is now '1'. Otherwise, the element at index `i` in `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
