Postcondition: **`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29). If `s[2]` was '-1' and `s[1]` was '1', then `s[2]` is now '0' and `s[1]` is now '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
