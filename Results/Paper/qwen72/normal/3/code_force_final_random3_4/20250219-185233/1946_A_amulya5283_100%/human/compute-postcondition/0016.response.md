Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is 1 or 2, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`**

Explanation:
- `res` is incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `i`) remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1` still holds true.
