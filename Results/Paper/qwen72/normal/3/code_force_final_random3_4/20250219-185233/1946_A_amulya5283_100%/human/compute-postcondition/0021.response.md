Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still the input integer minus 1.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still the input integer greater than 1.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and is still the sorted list of integers provided in the input.
- The variable `res` is updated to the count of elements in the list `a` from the index `mdx` to the end of the list (`n-1`) that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.
- The variable `mdx` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented through the loop and ends up being equal to `n` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
