Output State: **`t` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input.**

The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` was already specified as a sorted list of integers in the initial state, the list `a` remains sorted, and no changes are made to it. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
