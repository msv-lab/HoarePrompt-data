Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is 1 or 2 or 3, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is incremented by 1.
- Initially, `res` could be 0, 1, or 2.
- After the increment, `res` can be 1, 2, or 3.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `i`) remain unchanged, and their initial conditions still hold.
