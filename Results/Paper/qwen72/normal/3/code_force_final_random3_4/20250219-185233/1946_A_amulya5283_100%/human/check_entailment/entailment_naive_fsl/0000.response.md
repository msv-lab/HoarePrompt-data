Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the median needs to be increased. Specifically, the logic in the loop is flawed. The program incorrectly increments the result `res` for each element that is equal to the median, which does not align with the problem description. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, not to count how many elements are equal to the median.

A correct approach would involve finding the smallest number greater than the current median and calculating the number of operations needed to make the median equal to that number.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, the current median is 2. To increase the median, we need to increment the second element (index 1) by 1, making the array `[1, 3, 3, 4]` with a new median of 3. The program, however, outputs 2, which is incorrect.
