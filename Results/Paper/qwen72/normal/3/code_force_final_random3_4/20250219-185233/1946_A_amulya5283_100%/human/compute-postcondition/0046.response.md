Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 3 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input. If `n` == 1, there are no changes to `t`, `n`, or `a`. Otherwise, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
