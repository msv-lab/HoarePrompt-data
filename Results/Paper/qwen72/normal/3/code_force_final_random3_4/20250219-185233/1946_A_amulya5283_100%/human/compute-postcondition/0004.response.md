The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer - 1
- `n` is an input integer
- The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is now a list of integers, where the number of integers in the list is equal to the number of elements provided in the input.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided in the input.**
