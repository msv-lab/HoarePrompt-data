Postcondition: ***The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. If the program is running as the main module (`__name__` is set to `'__main__'`), `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the last input, `x` is the second integer from the last input, `y` is the third integer from the last input, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the first `x` strings in the original `arr`. If the program is not running as the main module, the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` retain their initial values.***
