Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the program always prints `x - 2`, which is the number of triangles that can be formed using the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie without considering the possibility of forming additional triangles by choosing more vertices (even though `y = 0` in this version, the logic should still be correct for the given constraints).

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
4 2 0
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
6
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
6
0
```

In the third test case, the program outputs `0` instead of `2`. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the number of chosen vertices is exactly 2. In this case, the correct number of triangles that can be formed is `2` (by forming two triangles using the two vertices and the two adjacent sides of the polygon).

The program should consider the structure of the polygon and the positions of the chosen vertices to correctly determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The current logic is too simplistic and does not account for the geometric properties of the polygon.
