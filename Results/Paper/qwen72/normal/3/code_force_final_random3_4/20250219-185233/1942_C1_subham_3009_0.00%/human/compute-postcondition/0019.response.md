Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is defined as `t - 3` and `t` must be at least 2.
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `y` is the third integer from the new input.
   - `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - `arr` is a list of `x` integers.
   - The program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x - 2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet only involves the variable `x`.
   - `x` is described as the second integer from the new input.
   - The print statement will compute and print the value of `x - 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `x` is the second integer from the new input, the output will be `x - 2`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the value of `x` minus 2.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer from the new input)**
