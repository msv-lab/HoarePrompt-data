#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (which is 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the last input, `x` is the second integer from the last input, `y` is the third integer from the last input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the first `x` strings in the original `arr`, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.
    #State: *The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. If the program is running as the main module (`__name__` is set to `'__main__'`), `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the last input, `x` is the second integer from the last input, `y` is the third integer from the last input, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the first `x` strings in the original `arr`. If the program is not running as the main module, the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers. It then prints `x - 2` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain the values from the last test case, and `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the input. The function does not modify the `chosen_vertices` list, and it only operates if the program is running as the main module.
