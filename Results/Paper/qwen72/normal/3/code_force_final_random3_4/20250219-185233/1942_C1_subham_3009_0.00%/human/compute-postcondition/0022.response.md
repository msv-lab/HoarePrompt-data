The function `max_triangles` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (which is 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can choose, given the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (which is 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using these vertices.**
