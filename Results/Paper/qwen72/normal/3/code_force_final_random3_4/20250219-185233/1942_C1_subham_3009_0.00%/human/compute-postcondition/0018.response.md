Output State: **`t` is `t - 3` and `t` must be at least 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `y` is the third integer from the new input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of strings from the new input.
- After executing the code, `arr` now contains `x` integers, which are the converted values of the first `x` elements of the original `arr`.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
