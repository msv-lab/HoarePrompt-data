Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices Bessie has chosen and no additional vertices (since \( y = 0 \)). The key insight here is that a regular polygon with \( n \) sides can be divided into \( x - 2 \) non-intersecting triangles using \( x \) chosen vertices, where \( x \) is the number of vertices Bessie has already selected.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and then reads the list of \( x \) chosen vertices.
3. **Output Calculation**: The program prints \( x - 2 \) for each test case, which is the correct formula for the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using \( x \) vertices in a regular polygon.

The formula \( x - 2 \) is derived from the fact that any set of \( x \) vertices in a polygon can form \( x - 2 \) non-intersecting triangles. This is a well-known property of polygons and is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
