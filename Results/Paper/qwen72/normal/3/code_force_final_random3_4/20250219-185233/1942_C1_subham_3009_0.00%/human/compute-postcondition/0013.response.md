Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 2` and `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input.
   - `y` is the third integer from the input.
   - `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the first `x` strings in the original `arr`.
   - The program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(x - 2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `x` is the second integer from the input.
   - The print statement will output the value of `x - 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `x` is the second integer from the input, the exact value of `x` is not specified in the initial state.
   - Therefore, the output will be `x - 2`, where `x` is the second integer from the input.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer from the input)**
