Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The maximum number of additional vertices we can choose is \( y \), but in this version \( y = 0 \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices.
   - Given \( x \) vertices, we can form \( x - 2 \) non-intersecting triangles by connecting these vertices with diagonals.

3. **Explanation of the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads the \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - Finally, it prints \( x - 2 \) for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The logic \( x - 2 \) is correct because it calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with \( x \) vertices.
   - The program does not use the values of \( n \) or \( y \) because they are not needed for the calculation in this specific problem (since \( y = 0 \)).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \), and \( y = 0 \).
   - It correctly processes the vertices chosen by Bessie and ensures they are distinct and within the range \( 1 \) to \( n \).

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
