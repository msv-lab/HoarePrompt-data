Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`. `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated based on the input provided.
- The input is split and each part is converted to an integer, then assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively.
- The values of `t` and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged.
- The program is still running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is still set to `'__main__'`.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than or equal to 0 remains valid.
