The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements of `l`, `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in `l`.**
