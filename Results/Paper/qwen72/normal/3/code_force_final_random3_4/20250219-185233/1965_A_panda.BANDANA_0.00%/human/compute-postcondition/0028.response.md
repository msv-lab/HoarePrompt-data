The function `func` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function should process an input `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are provided. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns the result for each test case. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes the piles of stones and returns some form of output based on the input for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function returns the result for each test case based on the input piles of stones.**
