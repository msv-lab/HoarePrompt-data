The given `print` statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`. The precondition provides information about several variables and objects (`i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, `m`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string literal provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **Alice**
