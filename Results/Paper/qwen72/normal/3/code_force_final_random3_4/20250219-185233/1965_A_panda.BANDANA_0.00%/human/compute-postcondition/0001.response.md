To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `t` should be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4)**
