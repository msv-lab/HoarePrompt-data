### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to remove a positive integer \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If there is at least one pile with exactly 1 stone, the first player (Alice) is forced to choose \( k = 1 \). This means that in the next turn, the second player (Bob) will be able to remove 1 stone from each pile, and the game will continue until all piles are empty. Since Alice is forced to make the first move, Bob will always have a move after Alice, and eventually, Bob will win.
   - If there are no piles with exactly 1 stone, Alice can always choose \( k \) such that she can make a move that leaves Bob in a position where he cannot win. For example, if all piles have an even number of stones, Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and then Bob will be forced to make a move that leaves Alice with a winning position.

3. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles \( n \) and the list of pile sizes \( l \).
   - It checks if there is any pile with exactly 1 stone using `if 1 in l`.
   - If there is a pile with 1 stone, it prints "Bob" because Alice will be forced to choose \( k = 1 \) and Bob will win.
   - If there are no piles with 1 stone, it prints "Alice" because Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where there is at least one pile with 1 stone.
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no piles with 1 stone.
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where all piles are empty initially, but since the problem guarantees that each pile has at least 1 stone, this case is not applicable.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program efficiently checks for the presence of 1 in the list of pile sizes, which is a linear operation \( O(n) \).
   - The program processes each test case independently, ensuring that it can handle the maximum constraints \( t \le 10^4 \) and \( n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the given problem description and constraints. It correctly identifies that if there is any pile with 1 stone, Bob will win, and otherwise, Alice will win.

Correctness: **True**
