Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `k` is 4, `no_path` is False**

The code snippet sets `no_path` to False, overriding its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `no_path` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
