Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `b[-2]` is not '>', `no_path` is either True or False based on the conditions provided. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is 1, `no_path` is either True or False based on the conditions provided. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is greater than 1, `no_path` is False if any character at an even index in `b` is not '>', and if `no_path` is False, then `k` is the last odd number less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True. If the initial value of `no_path` is True, it remains True. If the initial value of `no_path` is False, it remains False.***
