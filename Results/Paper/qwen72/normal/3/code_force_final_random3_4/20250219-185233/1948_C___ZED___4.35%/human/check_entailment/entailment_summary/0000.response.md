Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for `b[-2]`**: The function first checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not '>'. If it is not, the function prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. This check is valid because if the second-to-last cell in the second row does not point to the right, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row, which is the target cell `(2, n)`.

2. **Special Case for `n == 1`**: The function then checks if `n` is 1. If it is, the function prints 'YES'. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that `n` is always even and `2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`. Therefore, `n` can never be 1, and this check is unnecessary and will never be true.

3. **Path Checking for Even and Odd Indices**:
   - The function checks if there is a path from the first row to the second row by examining the characters at even indices in `b` and odd indices in `a`.
   - It sets `no_path` to `True` and then iterates over the even indices in `b`. If any character at an even index is not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this loop, it resets `no_path` to `True` and then iterates over the odd indices in `a`. If any character at an odd index is not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, if `no_path` is `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Logical Error in Path Checking**:
   - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The function assumes that if all even indices in `b` are '>' and all odd indices in `a` are '>', then there is a path. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
   - The robot must be able to move from the first row to the second row and then follow the arrows to reach the target cell. The current logic does not account for the robot's ability to move between rows and follow the arrows correctly.

5. **Correct Path Checking**:
   - The correct approach would be to simulate the robot's movement from the starting cell `(1, 1)` to the target cell `(2, n)`. The robot should be able to move left, right, up, or down, and then follow the arrow in the current cell.
   - The function should check if the robot can move to the second row and then follow the arrows to reach the last cell in the second row.

Given the logical error in the path checking and the unnecessary check for `n == 1`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
