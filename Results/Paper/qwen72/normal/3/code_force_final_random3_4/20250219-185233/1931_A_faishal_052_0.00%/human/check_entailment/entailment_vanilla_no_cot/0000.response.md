Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it handles the encoding and decoding process. Specifically, the program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded to the given sum.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Sum:**
   - The program subtracts 26 from `lex` multiple times, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `lex` is 70, the program will subtract 26 twice and then append the remaining 18, resulting in `[26, 26, 18]`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The correct approach should be to start from the smallest possible values and incrementally build the word to ensure it is lexicographically smallest.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array `arr` after constructing it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `lex = 70`, the correct word should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26), but sorting would give "zrz" (26 + 18 + 26).

### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, you should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the letters and then adjust the remaining sum accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [1, 1, 1]  # Start with the smallest possible values
        lex -= 3  # Subtract the initial values (1 + 1 + 1)
        
        # Distribute the remaining sum to the letters
        for j in range(3):
            if lex >= 25:
                arr[j] += 25
                lex -= 25
            else:
                arr[j] += lex
                lex = 0
                break
        
        # Print the result
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()  # Move to the next line for the next test case

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** Start with `arr = [1, 1, 1]` to represent the smallest possible values for the three letters.
- **Subtract Initial Values:** Subtract 3 from `lex` to account for the initial values of 1 for each letter.
- **Distribute Remaining Sum:** Distribute the remaining sum to the letters in a way that ensures the word remains lexicographically smallest. This is done by adding as much as possible to the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.
- **Print the Result:** Convert the values in `arr` to their corresponding letters and print them.

This approach ensures that the word is constructed in the lexicographically smallest order.
