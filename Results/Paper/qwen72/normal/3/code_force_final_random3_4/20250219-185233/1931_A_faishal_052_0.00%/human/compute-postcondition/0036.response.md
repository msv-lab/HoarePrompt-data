The code `arr.append(lex)` adds the value of `lex` to the end of the list `arr`. The value of `lex` depends on its initial value as described in the initial state. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The range is also not affected.

- If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now `lex - 2`, and `arr` initially contains [1, 1]. After appending, `arr` will be [1, 1, `lex - 2`].
- If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `lex` is now `lex - 27`, and `arr` initially contains [26, 1]. After appending, `arr` will be [26, 1, `lex - 27`].
- If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is now `lex - 52`, and `arr` initially contains [26, 26]. After appending, `arr` will be [26, 26, `lex - 52`].

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the range is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now `lex - 2`, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 2`]. If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `lex` is now `lex - 27`, and `arr` is [26, 1, `lex - 27`]. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is now `lex - 52`, and `arr` is [26, 26, `lex - 52`].**
