The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `range`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `range` value. If `range` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial state of `j` is 2, but this does not affect the loop's execution since `j` will be reassigned by the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `range` must be greater than 0, and `j` will start at 0 as per the `range(2)`.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer**
