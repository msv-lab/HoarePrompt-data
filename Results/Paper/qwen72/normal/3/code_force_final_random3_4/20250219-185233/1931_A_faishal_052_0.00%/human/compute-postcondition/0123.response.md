Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 3`. If `lex` is greater than 24 and less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 28`. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 50, `arr` is `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 52`. If `lex` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 78`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 78`. If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 78`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations (which is 2 times based on the `range(2)`), the variable `j` will be 2, indicating that the loop has completed. The variable `arr` will contain a list of three elements, and `lex` will be updated based on the initial value of `lex` as follows:
- If `lex` was less than or equal to 24, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 1]` and `lex` will be reduced by 3.
- If `lex` was greater than 24 and less than or equal to 25, `arr` will be `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` will be reduced by 28.
- If `lex` was greater than 25 and less than or equal to 50, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` will be reduced by 52.
- If `lex` was greater than 50 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` will be reduced by 78.
- If `lex` was greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` will be reduced by 78.
- If `lex` was greater than 77, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` will be reduced by 78.
