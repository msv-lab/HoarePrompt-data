Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer between 1 and 25, `j` is 0, `range` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since the initial value of `lex` is an input integer greater than 26 but less than 52, subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a new value for `lex` that is between 1 and 25.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, `j`, and `range` remain unchanged.
