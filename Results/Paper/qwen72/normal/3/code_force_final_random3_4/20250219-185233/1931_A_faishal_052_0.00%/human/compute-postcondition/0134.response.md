The function `func` is expected to accept two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a constraint of 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the encoded word, with a constraint of 3 ≤ n ≤ 78. The function should return the decoded word for each test case.

However, the provided function signature does not explicitly list these parameters. Assuming the function should indeed accept these parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and `n`, an integer representing the encoded word for each test case (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). For each test case, the function returns the decoded word.**
