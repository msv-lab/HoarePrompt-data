To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `range` is 3.
   - `lex` is an input integer.

2. **Understanding the `arr` list:**
   - `arr` is initially a sorted list.
   - `lex` is appended to `arr`.
   - The exact values of `arr` are not provided, but we know that `arr` is sorted and `lex` is the last element in the list.

3. **Accessing `arr[k]`:**
   - `k` is 2.
   - `arr[k]` will access the third element in the list `arr` (since list indices are 0-based).

4. **Converting to character:**
   - The `print` statement uses `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - Adding 96 to `arr[k]` will shift the integer value to the corresponding lowercase letter in the ASCII table (since 'a' is 97, 'b' is 98, etc.).

5. **Output:**
   - The output will be the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.
   - Since `arr` is sorted and `lex` is appended, `arr[2]` will be the third smallest element in the list.
   - The exact value of `arr[2]` depends on the initial sorted list and the value of `lex`.

Given the initial state and the structure of the problem, the output will be the character corresponding to the third element in the sorted list `arr` plus 96.

Output: **chr(arr[2] + 96) (where arr[2] is the third element in the sorted list `arr` and lex is the input integer appended to `arr`)**
