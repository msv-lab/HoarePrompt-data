To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `range` is 3.
   - `lex` is the same as before (though we don't have a specific value for `lex` provided).
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses the `chr` function to convert an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The integer is calculated as `arr[k] + 96`.
   - `k` is 0, so we are looking at the first element of the list `arr`.
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order, but we don't have the specific values of `arr`. However, we know that `arr[0]` is the smallest element in the list.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the first element of `arr` as `arr[0]`.
   - The `chr` function will convert `arr[0] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - For example, if `arr[0]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96) = chr(97) = 'a'`.
   - If `arr[0]` is 2, then `chr(2 + 96) = chr(98) = 'b'`.
   - And so on.

Since the exact value of `arr[0]` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `arr[0]`.

Output: **chr(arr[0] + 96) (where arr[0] is the first element of the sorted list arr)**
