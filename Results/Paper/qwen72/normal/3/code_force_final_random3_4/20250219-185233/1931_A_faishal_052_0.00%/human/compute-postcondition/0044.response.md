Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 2`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, [1, `lex - 27`, 26] if `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 52`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `k` is 3, range is 3.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The array `arr` still contains the same values as it did initially, depending on the value of `lex`. The loop variable `k` has incremented to 3, and the range is still 3.
