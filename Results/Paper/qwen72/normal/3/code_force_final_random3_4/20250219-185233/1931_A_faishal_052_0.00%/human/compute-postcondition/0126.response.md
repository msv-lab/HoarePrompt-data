The only objects in the loop head are the variable `k` and the `range` object, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `range` object. The `range(3)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 2, which means the loop will execute 3 times. The variable `k` is set to 3 before the loop starts, but for the loop to execute, `k` must be reset to 0 or the starting value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 0, `range` is 3, `lex` is the same as before, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order**
