The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the `range` (which is 2 in this case), so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and the range is 2. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is increased by 1, so `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 2, but since `j` is now 2, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the range is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now less than or equal to 24, and `arr` is a list with two elements [1, 1]. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 26, `lex` is now greater than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 1]. If `lex` is greater than 25, `arr` is a list containing [26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing [26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex - 26`.**
