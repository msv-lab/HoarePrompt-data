Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer less than or equal to 25.**

The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so it is now an input integer less than or equal to 25. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
