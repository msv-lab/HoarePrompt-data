The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` adds the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `range`) are not affected by this code. The value of `lex` remains unchanged. The length of `arr` is now increased by 1, but the specific content of `arr` depends on the initial state.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list with `lex` appended to it, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, and `lex` is an input integer.**
