Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the element 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since `lex` was initially greater than 26, after subtracting 26, `lex` is now greater than 0. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `range`, and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
