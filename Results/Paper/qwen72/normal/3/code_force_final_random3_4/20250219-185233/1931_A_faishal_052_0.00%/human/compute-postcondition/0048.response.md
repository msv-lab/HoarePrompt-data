The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the `range` function, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range being provided. The `range(2)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, which means the loop will execute 2 times regardless of the initial value of `j`. However, for the loop to start correctly, `j` should be set to 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer**
