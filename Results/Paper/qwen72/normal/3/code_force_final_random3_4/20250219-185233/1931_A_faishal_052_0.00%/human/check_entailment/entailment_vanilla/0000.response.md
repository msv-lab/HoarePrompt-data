Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `lex` which represents the encoded word.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then iterates 2 times (for the first two letters) and checks the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The program then sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - Finally, it prints the corresponding characters for the values in `arr`.

4. **Issues with the Algorithm**:
   - The logic for determining the positions of the letters is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `if lex <= 26` and `elif lex < 52` do not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining sum to the letters.
   - The program should ensure that the sum of the positions of the three letters equals `lex` and that the letters are as small as possible while maintaining the sum.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter to make the sum equal to `lex`.
   - We can achieve this by:
     - Assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first letter.
     - Assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the second letter.
     - Adjusting the third letter to make the sum equal to `lex`.

6. **Example**:
   - For `lex = 24`, the correct approach would be:
     - First letter: 1 (a)
     - Second letter: 1 (a)
     - Third letter: 24 - 1 - 1 = 22 (v)
     - Result: "aav"

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly handle the distribution of the sum to the letters, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

Correctness: **False**
