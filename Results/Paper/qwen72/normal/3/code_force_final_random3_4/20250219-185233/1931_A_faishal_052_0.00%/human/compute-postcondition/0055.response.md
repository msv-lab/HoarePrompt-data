Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer between 1 and 25.**

The value of `lex` is updated by subtracting 26 from its original value. Since `lex` was originally between 27 and 51 (inclusive), after subtracting 26, `lex` is now between 1 and 25 (inclusive). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
