Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- **`n`**: Remains the initial input integer.
- **`inp`**: Remains a list of integers with at least `t` elements.
- **`x`**: After the loop completes, `x` will hold the smallest integer in the list `inp`.
- **`y`**: After the loop completes, `y` will hold the second smallest integer in the list `inp`.
- **`ans`**: This variable counts the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. If there are no such integers, `ans` will be 0. Otherwise, `ans` will be the count of such integers.
