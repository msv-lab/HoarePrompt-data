Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `y` is the first element in the list `inp`. `a` is the first element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `x` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `a` is the second element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `x` is set to `a` and `y` is set to `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is set to `a`. In this case, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least three elements, and `a` is the third element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a`, `y` is set to `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` or if `a` is greater than `n + 1` and less than or equal to `y`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, then `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 2. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is set to `n + 1`. `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` and less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, otherwise `ans` is 3. `x == y` is True if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x == y` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
