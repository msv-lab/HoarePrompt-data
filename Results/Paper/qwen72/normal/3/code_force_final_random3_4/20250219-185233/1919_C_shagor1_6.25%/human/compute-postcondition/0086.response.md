Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `a` is the first element in `inp`, `x` is `n + 1`, and `y` is `n + 1`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is 1. In all cases, `ans` is either 0 or 1, and `x` and `y` are updated accordingly based on the value of `a`.***
