Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is the second element in the list `inp`, `a` is the second element in the list `inp`, `ans` is 1 if the second element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x` or if the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`. `ans` is 2 if the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and greater than `y`. `x == y` is evaluated to a boolean value.**
