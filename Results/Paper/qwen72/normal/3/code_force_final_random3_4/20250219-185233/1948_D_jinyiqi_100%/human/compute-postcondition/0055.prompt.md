Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j - 1`, `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n - j):
    if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 0
    if count == j:
        print(count * 2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing, and `count` retains its value as either 2 or 0, depending on the initial conditions. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2, and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, and `count` is 0. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 2, and `count` is either 3, 1, or 0. If `count` equals `j`, the program returns the value of `count`. Otherwise, the program does not return `count`, and `count` remains either 3, 1, or 0 based on the initial conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
