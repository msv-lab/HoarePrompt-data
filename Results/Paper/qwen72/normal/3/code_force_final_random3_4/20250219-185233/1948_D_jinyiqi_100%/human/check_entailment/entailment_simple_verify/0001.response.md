### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a for loop. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. Inside the function, the string `s` is read from the input and converted to a list of characters, which is appropriate for easier manipulation and comparison.

3. **Tandem Repeat Check**:
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of the first half of the tandem repeat, starting from the largest possible half-length (`n // 2`) down to 1. This is a good approach to find the longest tandem repeat.
   - For each half-length `j`, it checks if there is a substring of length `2*j` that can be a tandem repeat by comparing characters in the first half with the corresponding characters in the second half.
   - The condition `if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` correctly handles the case where either character is a question mark or the characters are already equal. This ensures that the program considers question marks as wildcards.
   - The counter `count` is used to track the number of consecutive pairs of characters that satisfy the condition. If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and the program prints `count * 2` and returns from the function.

4. **Output**:
   - If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the program prints `0`. This is consistent with the problem description.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - The function `func_1` is expected to handle a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with the length of `s` between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. This is correctly handled by the program.

- **State Inside Function**:
  - The string `s` is converted to a list of characters, and `n` is set to the length of `s`.
  - The outer loop iterates over possible half-lengths `j` from `n // 2` down to 1.
  - The inner loop iterates over possible starting positions `k` for the substring of length `2*j`.
  - The condition `if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` correctly handles the tandem repeat check.
  - The counter `count` is reset to 0 if the characters do not match and neither is a question mark.
  - If `count` reaches `j`, the program prints `count * 2` and returns, which correctly identifies the longest tandem repeat.

- **State After Function Call**:
  - If no tandem repeat is found, the program prints `0` and returns. This is the correct behavior for the given problem.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic for finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks. It follows the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
