The function `solve` is expected to be called within a context where the input is provided through standard input or a similar mechanism, and it processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a string `s` of length 1 to 5000, inclusive, containing only lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000.
