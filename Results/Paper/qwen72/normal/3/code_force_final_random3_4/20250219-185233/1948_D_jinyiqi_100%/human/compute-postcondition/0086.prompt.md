You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: `s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is 1, and `count` is the number of consecutive pairs of characters in `s` that satisfy the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` from `k = 0` to `k = n - j - 1`. If `count` reaches `j` at any point, the program prints `2 * j` and returns. Otherwise, the loop completes and `count` is less than `j`.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0 (where 0 is printed if no consecutive pairs of characters in `s` satisfy the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + 1] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + 1]`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. It also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the current value of `count` which is equal to `j`. `j` is `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of `s`.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: The program returns nothing.

Case_4: The program returns nothing.

Case_5: The program returns nothing. However, the value of `count` is either 2 or 0, depending on the conditions. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 0.

Case_6: The program returns the value of `count`, which is either 3, 1, or 0, based on the initial conditions.

Case_7: The program returns the current value of `count`, which is equal to `j`. Given `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `count` is initially set to `j`, the program returns `n // 2 - 2`.

Case_8: The program returns the value of `count`, which is either 1 or 0, depending on whether the conditions for `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are met.

Case_9: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
