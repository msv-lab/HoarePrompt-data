#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: `s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is 1, and `count` is the number of consecutive pairs of characters in `s` that satisfy the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` from `k = 0` to `k = n - j - 1`. If `count` reaches `j` at any point, the program prints `2 * j` and returns. Otherwise, the loop completes and `count` is less than `j`.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0 (where 0 is printed if no consecutive pairs of characters in `s` satisfy the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + 1] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + 1]`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, where the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. It processes the string to find the largest integer `j` such that there are `j` consecutive pairs of characters in `s` (at positions `k` and `k + j`) that satisfy one of the following conditions: `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. If such a `j` is found, the function prints `2 * j` and returns. If no such `j` is found after checking all possible values, the function prints `0` and returns. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
