You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `x` from the input, and for each value of `x`, it reads `x` pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (each pair on a new line). For each pair, it prints the two integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values have been processed and printed, but no changes are made to any external variables or state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` and `y` are equal correctly. According to the problem description, if `x` and `y` are equal, the output should be the same number twice. However, the program's logic only checks if `x` is less than `y` or not, and does not explicitly handle the case where `x` equals `y`. This can lead to incorrect output in some cases.

For example, if the input is:
```
10
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

The program will output:
```
1 9
4 8
1 4
3 4
0 2
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

This is correct, but if the input is:
```
1
5 5
```

The program will output:
```
5 5
```

This is correct, but the issue lies in the logic not explicitly handling the equality case, which could be a potential bug in more complex scenarios. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
