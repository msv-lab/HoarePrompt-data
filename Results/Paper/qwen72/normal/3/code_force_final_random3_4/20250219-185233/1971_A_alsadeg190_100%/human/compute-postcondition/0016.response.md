Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` must be greater than 1.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x` in that order. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **y, x (where y is the value of the integer y and x is an integer greater than 1)**
