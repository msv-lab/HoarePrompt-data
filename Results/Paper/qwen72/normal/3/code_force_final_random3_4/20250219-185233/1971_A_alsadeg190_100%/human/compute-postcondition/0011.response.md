The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x` in the order they are provided. Based on the initial state:

- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `i` is 1, but it is not used in the print statement.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, they will be whatever the user inputs when the program runs.

Output: **y, x (where y and x are the input integers provided by the user)**
