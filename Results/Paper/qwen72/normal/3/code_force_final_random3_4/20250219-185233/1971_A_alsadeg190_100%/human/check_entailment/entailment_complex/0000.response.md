Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` does not take any parameters, which is consistent with the problem description as it reads all necessary inputs from `stdin`.
   - The function reads an integer `x` which is supposed to represent the number of test cases. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**:
   - The function then enters a loop that runs `x` times, which is appropriate for processing `t` test cases.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` for each test case. This is also correct as per the problem description.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The function checks if `x` is less than `y` and prints the pair in ascending order. If `x` is not less than `y`, it prints the pair in descending order to ensure the output is always in ascending order.
   - This logic correctly implements the requirement to print the minimum followed by the maximum of the two integers.

4. **Variable Naming and Scope**:
   - The use of `x` for both the number of test cases and one of the integers in each test case can be confusing. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program because the loop variable `i` is not used in the logic, and the `x` and `y` inside the loop are redefined for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `x` and `y` are equal, or when they are at the boundaries of the input constraints (0 and 9).

6. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function correctly processes the input and produces the expected output for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
