Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least `len(rev_val)` elements, `x` is `len(rev_val) - 1`. `rev_res` is a string that contains the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string, plus the string representation of all elements in `rev_val` at even indices, and the reversed string of all elements in `rev_val` at odd indices.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variables `y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain unchanged.
- The variable `operational_list` also remains unchanged.
- The variable `rev_val` is still a sorted list of strings, but it must have at least as many elements as its initial length.
- The variable `x` is now equal to `len(rev_val) - 1`, which is the last index of the `rev_val` list.
- The variable `rev_res` is a string that has been built by concatenating:
  - The original value of `rev_res` (which includes the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string).
  - The string representation of all elements in `rev_val` at even indices.
  - The reversed string of all elements in `rev_val` at odd indices.
