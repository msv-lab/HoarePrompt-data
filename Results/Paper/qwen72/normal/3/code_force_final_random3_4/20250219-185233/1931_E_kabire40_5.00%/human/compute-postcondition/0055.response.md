The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `operational_list`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `operational_list`. If `operational_list` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `x` will be the first element of `operational_list` at the start of the loop.

State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces and must have at least 1 element, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `rev_res` is an empty string**
