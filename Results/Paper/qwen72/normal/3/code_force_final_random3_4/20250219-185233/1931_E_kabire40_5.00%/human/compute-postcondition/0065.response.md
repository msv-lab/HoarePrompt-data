Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`.
- `rev_val` was initially an empty list, and now it contains the reversed string of `x`.
- The other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`, `x_rev`) remain unchanged.
- `rev_res` remains an empty string as it was not affected by the code.
