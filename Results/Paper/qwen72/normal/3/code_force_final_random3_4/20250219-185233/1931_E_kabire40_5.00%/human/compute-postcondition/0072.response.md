Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `y` remains 1.
- The variable `int(input())` must still be a positive integer greater than 1.
- The variables `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged.
- The variable `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces.
- The variable `x` will be the last element of `operational_list` after the loop finishes.
- The variable `x_rev` will be the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`.
- The variable `rev_res` will be a string containing all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string.
- The variable `rev_val` will be a list containing the reversed strings of all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string.
