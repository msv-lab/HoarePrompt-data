Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string, and the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is not even, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string, plus the reversed string of `val_in`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 1, `val_in` is the integer representation of the string at index 1 in `rev_val`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that includes the string representation of `val_in` appended to its previous value. If `x` is not even, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the reversed string of `val_in`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2, `val_in` is the integer representation of the string at index 1 in `rev_val`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that includes the string representation of `val_in` appended to its previous value. If `x` is not even, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the reversed string of `val_in`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
