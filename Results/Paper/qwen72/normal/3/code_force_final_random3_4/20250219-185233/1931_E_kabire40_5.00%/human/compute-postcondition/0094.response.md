Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list` + (len(rev_val) - 1), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string, and `rev_res` is a string that concatenates the string representations of the integer values of the elements at even indices in `rev_val` and the reversed strings of the elements at odd indices in `rev_val`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `y` remains unchanged at 1.
- The value of `int(input())` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
- The values of `list_len` and `max_power` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- The `operational_list` remains unchanged as a list of strings split from the input string.
- The value of `x` is the last element of `operational_list` plus the number of elements in `rev_val` minus 1.
- The value of `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the updated `x`.
- The `rev_val` list is fully populated with the sorted reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed.
- The `rev_res` string is the result of concatenating the string representations of the integer values of the elements at even indices in `rev_val` and the reversed strings of the elements at odd indices in `rev_val`.
