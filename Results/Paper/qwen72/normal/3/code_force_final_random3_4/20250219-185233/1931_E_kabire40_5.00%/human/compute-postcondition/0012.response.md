The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `operational_list`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `y` is 0
- `int(input())` must be a positive integer
- `list_len` is an input string
- `max_power` is an input string
- `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element
- `x` is the first element of `operational_list`
- `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`
- If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is set to the first element of `operational_list` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `operational_list` must be assigned to `x`, and `operational_list` must still have at least one element (which is now the second element from the previous iteration).

State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the second element of `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is set to the second element of `operational_list` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.**
