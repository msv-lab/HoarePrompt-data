Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `y`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res`. The variables `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values of the two strings obtained from splitting the input provided by the user.
