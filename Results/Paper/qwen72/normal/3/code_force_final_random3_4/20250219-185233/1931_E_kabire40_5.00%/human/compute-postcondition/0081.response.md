Postcondition: ***`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of at least one element of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string, `x` is not adjusted. If the integer value of `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string representation of the integer value of the element in `rev_val` at the index `x` appended to the previous value of `rev_res`, and `val_in` is the integer value of the element in `rev_val` at the index `x`. If the integer value of `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the reversed string of the element in `rev_val` at the index `x`, and `val_in` is the element in `rev_val` at the index `x`.***
