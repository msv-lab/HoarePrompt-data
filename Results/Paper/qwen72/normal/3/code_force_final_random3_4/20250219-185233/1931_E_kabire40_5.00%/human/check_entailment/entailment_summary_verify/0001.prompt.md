You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `list_len` and `max_power`, and a list of `list_len` integers. It reverses each integer in the list, and if the reversed integer has the same length as the original, it appends the original integer to a result string. If the reversed integer has a different length, it appends the reversed integer to a list. This list is then sorted, and for each element in the sorted list, it appends the integer value to the result string if the index is even, and the reversed string if the index is odd. Finally, it compares the integer value of the result string to \(10\) raised to the power of `max_power` and prints 'Sasha' if the result string's integer value is greater, otherwise it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of integers) and `m` (the threshold power of 10) from the input.
   - It then reads the list of integers `operational_list`.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program reverses the digits of each integer in the list and checks if the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original integer.
   - If the lengths are the same, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_res`.
   - If the lengths are different, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts the `rev_val` list.
   - It then iterates over the sorted `rev_val` list and alternates between appending the reversed integer and the original integer to `rev_res`.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - After constructing the final `rev_res` string, the program checks if the resulting integer is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Analysis:

- **Reversing Digits:**
  - The program correctly reverses the digits of each integer and checks the length.
  - However, the logic of appending to `rev_res` or `rev_val` based on the length of the reversed integer is not optimal. The length check should not be the deciding factor for whether to append to `rev_res` or `rev_val`.

- **Sorting and Concatenation:**
  - The program sorts the `rev_val` list, which is unnecessary for the optimal solution.
  - The alternating concatenation logic is incorrect. The optimal strategy for both players is to maximize or minimize the resulting integer, not to alternate based on the index.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The program correctly checks if the final integer is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

### Correct Solution:

To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:
- Anna's goal is to minimize the final number.
- Sasha's goal is to maximize the final number.
- The final number is formed by concatenating all the integers after Anna's moves.

The optimal strategy for Anna is to reverse the digits of the largest possible number to minimize the impact on the final concatenated number. Sasha will then concatenate the numbers in a way that maximizes the final number.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        operational_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Anna's move: reverse the digits of each number
        reversed_list = [int(str(x)[::-1]) for x in operational_list]
        
        # Sasha's move: concatenate all numbers
        final_number = int(''.join(map(str, reversed_list)))
        
        # Check the winning condition
        if final_number >= 10 ** m:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of integers `operational_list`.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program reverses the digits of each integer in the list and stores them in `reversed_list`.

3. **Concatenation:**
   - The program concatenates all the reversed integers into a single integer `final_number`.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the `final_number` is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not follow the optimal strategy for both players. The corrected program follows the optimal strategy and should correctly determine the winner.
