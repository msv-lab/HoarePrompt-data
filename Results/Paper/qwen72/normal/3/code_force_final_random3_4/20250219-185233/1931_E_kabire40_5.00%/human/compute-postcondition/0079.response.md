Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of at least one element of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string, `x` is not adjusted, `rev_res` is not adjusted, `x` is an odd integer, `val_in` is the element in `rev_val` at the index `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `val_in = rev_val[x]` assigns the value of the element in the list `rev_val` at the index `x` to the variable `val_in`.
- Since `x` is the last element of `operational_list` and is an odd integer, `val_in` will be the element in `rev_val` at the index corresponding to the last element of `operational_list`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
