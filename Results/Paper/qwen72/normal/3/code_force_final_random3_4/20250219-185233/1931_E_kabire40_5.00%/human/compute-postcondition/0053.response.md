Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is -1, `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `list_len, max_power = input().split()` takes an input string, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. The other variables remain unchanged.
