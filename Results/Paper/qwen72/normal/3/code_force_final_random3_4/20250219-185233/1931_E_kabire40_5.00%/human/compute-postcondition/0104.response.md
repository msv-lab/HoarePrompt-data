Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the new input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of the new `operational_list` + (len(rev_val) - 1), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the new `x`, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, and the condition is not met.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is updated by the code snippet `operational_list = input().split()`.
- `operational_list` is now a list of strings derived from the new input string, split by spaces.
- The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, and the condition remain unchanged.
- `x` is now the last element of the new `operational_list` plus (len(rev_val) - 1), which is still -1 since `rev_val` is an empty list.
- `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the new `x`, but since `x` is still based on the last element of the new `operational_list` and `rev_val` is empty, `x_rev` will be the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of the new `operational_list`.
