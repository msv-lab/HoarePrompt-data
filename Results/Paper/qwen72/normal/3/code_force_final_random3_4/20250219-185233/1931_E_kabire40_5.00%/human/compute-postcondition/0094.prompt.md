Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of at least one element of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string, `x` is not adjusted. If the integer value of `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string representation of the integer value of the element in `rev_val` at the index `x` appended to the previous value of `rev_res`, and `val_in` is the integer value of the element in `rev_val` at the index `x`. If the integer value of `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the reversed string of the element in `rev_val` at the index `x`, and `val_in` is the element in `rev_val` at the index `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list` + 1, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of at least one element of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string and has at least one more element. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated to include the reversed string of the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list` + 2, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of at least one element of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string and has at least one more element. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of the integer value of the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed string of the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
