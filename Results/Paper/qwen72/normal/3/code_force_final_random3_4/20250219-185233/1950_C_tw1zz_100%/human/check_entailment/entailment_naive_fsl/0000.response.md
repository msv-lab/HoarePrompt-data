Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format correctly for AM times. According to the problem description, 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 AM in 12-hour format, but the program will output 12:00 PM for 12:00. This is a specific edge case that the program fails to handle correctly.
