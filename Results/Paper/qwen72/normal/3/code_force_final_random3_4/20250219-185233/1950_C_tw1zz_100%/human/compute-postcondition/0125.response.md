Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h` as described in the initial state.**

Explanation:
- The code `h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))` updates the values of `h` and `m` based on the input string.
- `h` is now the hour part of the input string.
- `m` is now the minute part of the input string.
- `m1` remains equal to `m`.
- The conditions for setting `h1` and `time` based on the value of `h` are still valid and will be applied when the subsequent code is executed.
- `t` and `s` retain their initial values and conditions.
