Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, and `m1` is equal to `m`. If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (i.e., '01' for '13', '02' for '14', etc.), and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is neither '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', nor '00', `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.***
