Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string provided by the user, `m` is the minute part of the input string provided by the user, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` and `time` remain as previously defined based on the initial hour part `h` of the string `s`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `s`, `m1`, `h1`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The variables `h` and `m` are updated to the hour and minute parts of the user-provided input string, respectively.
