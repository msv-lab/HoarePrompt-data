Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string provided by the user, `m` is the minute part of the input string provided by the user, `m1` is equal to `m`. For each valid input hour `h` (from '00' to '23'), `h1` is set to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format, and `time` is set to 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. If `h` is not a valid hour, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440, and `s` remains a string in the format "hh:mm". For each iteration, the hour part `h` of the input string is converted to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and stored in `h1`, and the time of day (AM or PM) is stored in `time`. The minute part `m` of the input string is also stored in `m1` for each iteration. If the hour part `h` is not a valid hour (i.e., not between '00' and '23'), `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.
