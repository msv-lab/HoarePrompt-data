Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the appropriate AM/PM designation. It handles all edge cases, such as converting "00:00" to "12:00 AM" and "12:00" to "12:00 PM". The program also maintains the leading zeroes for hours and minutes as required. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
