Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `h` is not equal to '09', '08', '07', '05', '04', '02', '01', '03', '06', '10', or '11'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '13', `h1` is set to '01' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '14', `h1` is set to '02' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '15', `h1` is set to '03' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '16', `h1` is set to '04' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '17', `h1` is set to '05' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '18', `h1` is set to '06' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '19', `h1` is set to '07' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '20', `h1` is set to '08' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '21', `h1` is set to '09' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '22', `h1` is set to '10' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is set to '11' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.***
