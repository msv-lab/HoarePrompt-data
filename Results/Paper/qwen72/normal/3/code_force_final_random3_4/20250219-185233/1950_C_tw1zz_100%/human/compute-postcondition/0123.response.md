Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59.
- `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`.
- `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- The value of `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`:
  - If `h` is '01', `h1` is set to '01' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is set to 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '12', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'PM'.
  - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.) and `time` is set to 'PM'.
  - If `h` is '00', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
  - If `h` is not one of the above values, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

### Print Statement:
```
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extract `h` and `m` from `s`**:
   - `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
   - `m` is the last two characters of `s`.

2. **Determine `h1` and `time` based on `h`**:
   - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is not one of the above values, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.

3. **Construct the Output**:
   - The `print` statement concatenates `h1`, ':', `m`, ' ', and `time` with no separators (`sep=''`).

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `s` is "15:30".
  - `h` is '15'.
  - `m` is '30'.
  - Since `h` is '15', `h1` is '03' (15 - 12) and `time` is 'PM'.
  - The output will be: `03:30 PM`.

### General Output:
- The output will be in the format `h1:mm time` where `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h` as described above.

### Final Output:
Output: **h1:mm time (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h in the input string s)**
