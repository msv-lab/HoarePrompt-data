Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `q` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where all elements are 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
    b[i] = b[i - 1] + x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`, `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
