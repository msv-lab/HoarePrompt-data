Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[i]` is updated to `b[i - 1] + x`. Given that `i` is 2, `b[2]` is now `b[1] + x`.
- The value of `b[1]` was previously `b[0] + x`.
- Therefore, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`, which can also be expressed as `b[0] + x + x` or `b[0] + 2*x`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `x` (1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise 2) remains valid.
