The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5). `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). `queries` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of the array `c`, an integer `q` representing the number of queries, a list of integers `c` where each element is greater than 0, and a list of `q` tuples `queries` where each tuple contains two integers representing the borders of a subarray. For each test case, the function processes the queries on the array `c` and returns the results of these queries.**
