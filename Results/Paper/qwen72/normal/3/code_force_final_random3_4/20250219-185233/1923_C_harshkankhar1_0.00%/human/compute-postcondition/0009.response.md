The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`**
