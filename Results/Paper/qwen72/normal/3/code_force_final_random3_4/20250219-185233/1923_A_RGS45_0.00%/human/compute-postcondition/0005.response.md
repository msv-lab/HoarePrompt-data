Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string.
- If '1' is found in the reversed string, `y` will be the index of that occurrence.
- If '1' is not found in the reversed string, `y` will be -1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
