Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- `z` is assigned the value of the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- The values of `x` and `y` are used to determine the substring `z`. If `x` or `y` is -1, `z` will be an empty string or may raise an error depending on the context.
