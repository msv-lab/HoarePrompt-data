The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where `a_i = 0` indicates a free cell and `a_i = 1` indicates a cell with a chip. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case:
- If the test case contains at least one cell with a chip, the function returns a value based on the specific logic applied to the cells with chips.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing cells with chips or free cells. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates the outcome of the test case based on the presence and configuration of chips in the cells.**
