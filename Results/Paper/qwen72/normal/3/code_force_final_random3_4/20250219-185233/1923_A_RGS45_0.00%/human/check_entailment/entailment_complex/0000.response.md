### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - The function uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (leftmost chip).
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (rightmost chip) by reversing the string and finding the first '1', then adjusting the index to match the original string.

3. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - The function extracts the substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - The function counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')` and prints this count.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The goal is to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
  - The number of operations required is the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which is correctly calculated by `z.count('0')`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If there is only one chip, the function will correctly return 0 because no operations are needed.
  - If all chips are already in a single block, the function will also correctly return 0.

- **Input Validation**:
  - The function assumes valid inputs as described in the problem statement.
  - It does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values, strings with characters other than '0' and '1'), but this is not required based on the problem description.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function is efficient for the given constraints (up to 1000 test cases and up to 50 cells per test case).

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. The state of the program and the operations performed are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
