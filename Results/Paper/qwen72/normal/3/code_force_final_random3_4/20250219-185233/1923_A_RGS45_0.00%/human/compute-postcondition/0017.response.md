Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- `arr` is now a string input by the user, replacing its previous value.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, but `arr` is updated to the new string input by the user.
