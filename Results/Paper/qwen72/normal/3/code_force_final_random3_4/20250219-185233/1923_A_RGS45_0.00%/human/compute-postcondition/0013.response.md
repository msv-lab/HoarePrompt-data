Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` updates the value of `z` to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
- The initial state specifies that `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, and `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- The value of `z` is now the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
