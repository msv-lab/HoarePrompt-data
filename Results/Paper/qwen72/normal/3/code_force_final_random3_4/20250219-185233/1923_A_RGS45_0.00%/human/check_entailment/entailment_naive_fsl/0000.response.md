Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple chips and the closest free cell to the left is not the immediate left cell. For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output `1`. This is because the program only considers the distance between the first and last chip, and does not account for the need to move chips that are not directly adjacent to form a single block.
