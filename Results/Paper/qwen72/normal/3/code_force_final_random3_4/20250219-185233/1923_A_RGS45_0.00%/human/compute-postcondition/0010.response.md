Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = str(input(''))` updates the value of `arr` to a new string input by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a string, so after this code, `arr` is still a string, but its value is now the user's input.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`) are not affected by this code, so their states remain as specified in the initial state.
