### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the ribbon as a string `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - The function uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (`x`).
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip from the end of the string, and then calculates the index from the start (`n - y`).

3. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - The function extracts the substring `z` from `arr` starting at the first chip (`x`) to the last chip (`n - y`).

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - The function counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the substring `z` and prints this count.

5. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic is based on the idea that the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block is the number of free cells between the first and last chip.
   - This is correct because moving all chips to the leftmost position of the block formed by the first and last chip will minimize the number of operations.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where all chips are already in a single block (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1 1`).
   - It also handles cases where there are no free cells between the first and last chip.

### Potential Issues:
- **Input Validation**:
  - The function assumes that the input is always valid, which is fine based on the problem description.
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The function does not explicitly handle the case where the input string `arr` does not contain any '1's, but the problem description guarantees that each test case has at least one chip.
- **Efficiency**:
  - The function is efficient for the given constraints (up to 50 cells and 1000 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
