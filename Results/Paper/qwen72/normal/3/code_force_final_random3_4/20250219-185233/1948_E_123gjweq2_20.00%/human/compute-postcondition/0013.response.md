Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`, `i` is `mid - 1`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]`, and `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions for `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged.
- The loop runs `mid` times, where `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- After the loop completes, the index `i` will be `mid - 1`.
- The elements of the array `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are filled with values starting from `left + 1` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent index.
- The elements of the array `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to the value of `clique`.
