Functionality: ** The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that for the range `[left, right]` in `arr`, the first half (or the first half plus one if the range length is odd) is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. The corresponding indices in `cliquess` are all set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value. **
