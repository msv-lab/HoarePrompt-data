You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We need to add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` is the main function that handles the input and output.
   - `make_array` is a helper function that assigns values to the vertices and determines their clique membership.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned values and clique memberships, respectively.
   - It iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the arrays.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It calculates the number of elements to be assigned in the current clique.
   - It assigns the smallest elements to the first half of the range and the largest elements to the second half.
   - It updates both `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.

5. **Edge Condition Analysis:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is crucial.
   - The program attempts to partition the vertices into cliques by assigning values in a way that ensures the edge condition is met.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique memberships for each vertex.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( k \ge n \), the graph should be a single clique, and the program should handle this correctly.
   - For smaller values of \( k \), the program should partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

8. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
       - `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`
       - `arr = [2, 1]`
       - `cliquess = [1, 1]`
       - This is correct because \( |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 2 \le 3 \).
     - **Example 2: \( n = 5, k = 4 \)**
       - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
       - `arr = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`
       - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
       - This is correct because the edge condition is met for the given partition.
     - **Example 3: \( n = 8, k = 16 \)**
       - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
       - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
       - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
       - This is correct because \( k \ge n \) and the graph is a single clique.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the given problem and examples. It assigns values to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required.

Correctness: **True**
