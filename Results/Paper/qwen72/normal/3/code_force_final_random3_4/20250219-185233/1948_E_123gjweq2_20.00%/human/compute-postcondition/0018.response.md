Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]`.
- `left + mid + i` is the index in the array `arr` that is being updated.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`, and `i` is 1, so `big_element - i` is `right + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `right`.
- Therefore, `arr[left + mid + i]` is now `right`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
