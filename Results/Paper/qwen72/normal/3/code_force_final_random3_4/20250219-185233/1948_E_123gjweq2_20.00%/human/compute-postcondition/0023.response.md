Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` remains a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`, and for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged. However, the elements in the array `arr` starting from the index `left + mid` up to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` have been updated to values from `right + 1` down to `right + 1 - (not_mid - 1)`, and the corresponding elements in the array `cliquess` have been set to the value of `clique`.
