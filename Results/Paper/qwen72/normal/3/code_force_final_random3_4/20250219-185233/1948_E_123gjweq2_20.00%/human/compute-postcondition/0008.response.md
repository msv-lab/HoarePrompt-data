Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`, `i` is 1, `arr[left]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left]` is `clique`, `arr[left + 1]` is `left + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` updates the value of `arr[left + 1]` to `small_element + 1`.
- Since `small_element` is `left + 1`, `small_element + 1` is `left + 2`.
- Therefore, `arr[left + 1]` is now `left + 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
