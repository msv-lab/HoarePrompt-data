The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `mid`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `mid`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `mid` must be greater than 2.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 2, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`, `i` is 2, `arr[left]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left]` is `clique`, `arr[left + 1]` is `left + 2`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`.**
