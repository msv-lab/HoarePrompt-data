Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right - 2`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `arr[left + mid + i]` is updated to `big_element - i`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `i` is 2.
- Therefore, `arr[left + mid + i]` is now `right + 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `right - 1`.
- However, the initial state specifies that `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right`, so after the update, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
