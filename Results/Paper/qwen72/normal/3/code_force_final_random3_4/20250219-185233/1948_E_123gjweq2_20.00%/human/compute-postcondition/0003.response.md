Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`.**

In simpler terms, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still calculated as `(right - left) // 2`. The new variable `not_mid` is calculated as the difference between `right - left + 1` and `mid`.
