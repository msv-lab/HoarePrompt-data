Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `done` is False.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(string)
```

This statement will print the value of the `string` variable. Since the `string` is described as an input string and no specific value is provided, the output will be the exact string that was input.

Output: **[string] (where [string] is the input string provided)**
