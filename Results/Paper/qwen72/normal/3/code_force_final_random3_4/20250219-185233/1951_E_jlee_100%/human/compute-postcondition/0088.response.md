Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 1, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
