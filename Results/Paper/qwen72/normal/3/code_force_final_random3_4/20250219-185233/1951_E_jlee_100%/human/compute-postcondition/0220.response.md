Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, and `done` remains False. Additionally, `s[j]` is equal to `x`.**
