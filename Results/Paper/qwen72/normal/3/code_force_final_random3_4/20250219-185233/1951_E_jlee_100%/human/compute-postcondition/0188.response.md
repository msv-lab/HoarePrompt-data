Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `count` is now equal to `j`, and `done` remains False.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
