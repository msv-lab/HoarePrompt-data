Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` <= 1, `count` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged. `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
