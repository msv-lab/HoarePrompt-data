Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `count2` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The current value of `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` remains False.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- Additionally, `count2` is greater than `count`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
