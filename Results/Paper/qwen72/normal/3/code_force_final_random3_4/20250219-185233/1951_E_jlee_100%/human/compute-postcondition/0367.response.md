Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, and `done` remains False. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` (the first character of `s`) is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to or greater than `count`, `done` is also set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is less than `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, `done` remains False, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1, and `done` remains False. If `count` is 0, `count` remains 0, and `done` remains False.***
