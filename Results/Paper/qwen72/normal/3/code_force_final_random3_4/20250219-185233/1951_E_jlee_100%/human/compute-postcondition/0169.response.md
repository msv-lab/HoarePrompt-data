To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count` is the position of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`.
   - `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the position `count`.
   - `done` is False.
   - If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state and conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. They only describe the state of the program before the `print` statement is executed.
   - Since the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
