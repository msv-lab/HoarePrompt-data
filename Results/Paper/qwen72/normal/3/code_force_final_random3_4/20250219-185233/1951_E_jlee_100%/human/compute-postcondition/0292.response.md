Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x`, and `done` is True if the loop has found a condition to print 'YES' and break, otherwise `done` remains False.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The variable `string` remains the input string.
- The variable `s` remains the list of characters from the input string.
- The variable `n` remains the length of the list `s`.
- The variable `x` remains the first character of the list `s`.
- The variable `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`.
- The variable `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x`.
- The variable `done` is True if the loop has found a condition to print 'YES' and break, otherwise, it remains False.
