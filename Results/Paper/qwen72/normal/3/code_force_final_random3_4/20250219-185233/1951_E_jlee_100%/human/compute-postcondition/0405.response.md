To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions that affect the variables and the string.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is a variable that is greater than 0.
- `count2` is a variable that is less than or equal to `count`.

### Conditions:
1. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
2. If `count2` is less than `count` or `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, or `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
3. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` <= 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
4. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
5. If `count` <= 0, the variables retain their initial values.

### Analysis:
- The `print(string)` statement will print the value of the `string` variable.
- The conditions described in the initial state and the subsequent conditions do not modify the `string` variable itself. They only affect the variables `count`, `count2`, and `done`.
- Since `string` is not modified by any of the given conditions, the output will be the original input string.

### Output:
Output: **string (where string is the original input string)**
