Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count2` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `done` remains False.
   - The current character `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `string[:j - 1]` means slicing the string from the start up to the character at index `j - 1`. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, a negative index in slicing means counting from the end of the string. However, `string[:0 - 1]` is equivalent to `string[:-1]`, which slices the string from the start up to the second-to-last character.
   - `string[j - 1:]` means slicing the string from the character at index `j - 1` to the end. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1, so `string[-1:]` slices the string from the last character to the end.

4. **Output:**
   - `string[:j - 1]` will be the string `string` excluding the last character.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will be the last character of the string `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `string` split into two parts: the string without its last character and the last character itself.

Output: **[string without its last character] [last character of string]**
