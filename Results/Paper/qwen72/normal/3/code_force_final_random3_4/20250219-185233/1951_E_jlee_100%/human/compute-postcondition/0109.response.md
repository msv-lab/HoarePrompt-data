Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `done` retains its original value and `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.***
