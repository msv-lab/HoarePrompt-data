Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`. If `n` is 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, we also continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
