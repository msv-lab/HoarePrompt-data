You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())

        done = False
        if n == 1:

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads a string `string` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |string| ≤ 10^6). The function checks if the string can be split into one or two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of substrings (1 or 2) and the substrings themselves. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is as described in the annotation, with `t` being greater than 0, `i` being `t-1`, and the last processed variables retaining their final values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters for easier manipulation.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string has only one character, it correctly prints "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome.

3. **First and Last Character Check:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the entire string is non-palindromic, and the program correctly prints "YES" with the partition as the entire string itself.

4. **All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program correctly prints "NO" because any substring of such a string will be a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If all but one character in the string are the same, the program checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from the rest. If so, it prints "NO" because the middle character will form a palindrome by itself.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the partition as the entire string.

6. **General Case:**
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are not the same when compared from the start and the end.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" with the partition as the entire string.
   - If no such pair is found, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character and the second character that is different from the first character.
   - It then prints "YES" with a partition of two substrings, ensuring that neither substring is a palindrome.

### Analysis of the General Case:
- The program correctly identifies if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- The logic for finding the first and second different characters and partitioning the string accordingly is sound and ensures that the substrings are non-palindromic.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings, strings with all characters the same, and strings with all but one character the same correctly.
- It also handles the general case where the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and edge cases. It correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate output.

### Correctness:
**True**
