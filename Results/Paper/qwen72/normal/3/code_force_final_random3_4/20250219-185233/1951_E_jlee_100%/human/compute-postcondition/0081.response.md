Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `done` is False if `count` is 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`.
   - `done` is True if `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and values for various variables, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement itself.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `j`, or `done`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is always `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
