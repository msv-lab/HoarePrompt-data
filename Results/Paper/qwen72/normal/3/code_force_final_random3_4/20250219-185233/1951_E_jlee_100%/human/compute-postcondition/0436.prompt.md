Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False. If all characters in `s` are equal to `x`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, and `done` remains False. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` (the first character of `s`) is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to or greater than `count`, `done` is also set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is less than `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, `done` remains False, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1, and `done` remains False. If `count` is 0, `count` remains 0, and `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1. If `count` > 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is less than `count` or `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, or `count2` is greater than `count`. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` <= 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` <= 0, the variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` is False. If `count` > 0 and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 2, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
