Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, and it is greater than 1.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `s[j] != x` and `count < 1` is checked.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
   - Then, `done` is set to False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
   - Otherwise, `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` will split the string `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`.
     - `string[j:]` will be the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

4. **Values of `j`:**
   - `j` is 1, so `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring starting from the second character of `string` to the end.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
