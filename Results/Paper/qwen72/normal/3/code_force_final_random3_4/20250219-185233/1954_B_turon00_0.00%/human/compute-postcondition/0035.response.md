Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code `aa = set(a)` creates a set `aa` containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The set `aa` now contains the unique elements from the list `a`.
