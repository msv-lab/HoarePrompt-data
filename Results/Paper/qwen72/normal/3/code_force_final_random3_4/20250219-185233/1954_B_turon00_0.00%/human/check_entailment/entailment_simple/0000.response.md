Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The key to this problem is understanding that a beautiful array allows operations that can change an element to match its neighbors if the neighbors are equal. The program's logic is based on the idea that if the array consists of all the same elements, it will always remain beautiful, and thus the answer is -1. If the array has different elements, the program tries to find the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element (`tmp`) that can be removed to break the pattern of the array being beautiful.

However, the program has a critical flaw in its approach to finding the minimum number of elements to remove. The logic of counting consecutive elements equal to the first element and then finding the minimum count among these does not correctly address the problem. The issue is that the program does not consider the structure of the array and the possibility of breaking the beautiful property by removing elements that are not necessarily consecutive or equal to the first element.

For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the consecutive `1`s and `2`s, but it fails to recognize that removing a single `1` at index 4 (or any other `1` in the middle) will make the array no longer beautiful. The program should instead focus on identifying the minimum number of elements that, when removed, will prevent any further operations from making all elements the same.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Identify the element that appears most frequently in the array.
2. Count the number of occurrences of this element.
3. If the most frequent element appears in every position, the array cannot be made non-beautiful, and the answer is -1.
4. Otherwise, the minimum number of elements to remove is the number of occurrences of the most frequent element minus one, as removing one less than the total occurrences will break the pattern.

Given the current logic, the program will not always produce the correct output for all test cases. For instance, for the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will output `3`, but the correct answer is `1` (removing any `3` at an index where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` will suffice).

Correctness: **False**
