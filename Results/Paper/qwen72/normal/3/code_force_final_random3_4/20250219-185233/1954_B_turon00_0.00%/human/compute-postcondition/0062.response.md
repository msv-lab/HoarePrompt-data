Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`. If `len(aa) == 1`, then `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers input by the user.
- The initial state already mentions that `a` is a list of integers input by the user, so this code does not change the initial state's description of `a`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.
