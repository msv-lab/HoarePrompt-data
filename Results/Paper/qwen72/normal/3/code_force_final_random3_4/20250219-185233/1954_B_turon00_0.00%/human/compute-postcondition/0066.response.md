Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`. If `len(aa) == 1`, then `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**
