You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` across all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Identifying a Beautiful Array:**
   - The problem states that the array is already beautiful, so we don't need to check if it is beautiful. We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it stop being beautiful.

3. **Handling Arrays with All Elements the Same:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If the set has only one element, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

4. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Edge Case: All Elements the Same:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.

- **General Case:**
  - The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the beautiful array.
  - The logic of counting consecutive elements and updating the minimum count is correct for finding the smallest segment of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the pattern.
  - However, the logic is flawed because it only considers the segments of consecutive elements equal to the first element. It does not consider other segments or the possibility of breaking the pattern by removing elements from different segments.

### Correctness:

- **Flaw in Logic:**
  - The program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of consecutive elements. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only consider the segments of `1`s and not the `2`s, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible segments of consecutive elements and may miss the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the beautiful array.

### Correctness: **False**
