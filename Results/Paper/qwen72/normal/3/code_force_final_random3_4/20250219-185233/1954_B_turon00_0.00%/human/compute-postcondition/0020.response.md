Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.
- Initially, `cnt` is 1.
- If `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is equal to `n`.
- If `a[0]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is 0.
- Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` will be the minimum value between `n` and 1, which is 1 if `n` is greater than 1, or `n` if `n` is 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
