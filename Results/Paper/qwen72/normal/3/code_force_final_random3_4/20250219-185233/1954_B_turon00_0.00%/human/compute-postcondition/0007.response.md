The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The precondition describes various variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the value `-1` that is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `_` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, and the length of this set is 1, meaning all elements in the list `a` are the same.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
