Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is the input integer, which represents the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between `n` (the length of the list `a`) and `cnt`.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - The value of `ans` will be the smaller of `n` or `cnt`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to the first element of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the `print(ans)` statement will output the minimum value between the length of the list `a` and the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **min(n, cnt) (where n is the length of the list a and cnt is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list a that are equal to the first element of the list a)**
