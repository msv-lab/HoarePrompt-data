Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged and still adhere to their initial conditions.
