Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly address the problem. The logic in the solution is flawed, and it does not properly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The solution checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. While this is a valid check for arrays where all elements are the same, it does not correctly handle the more complex case where the array can be made beautiful by the given operations.

2. **Flawed Approach to Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The solution attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`tmp`). However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the structure of the array and the operations that can be performed to make it beautiful.
   - The problem requires identifying the minimum number of elements to remove such that no further operations can make all elements the same. The solution does not account for this requirement.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle edge cases correctly, such as arrays of length 1 or 2, which are inherently non-beautiful and should always return -1.

A correct approach would involve:
- Identifying the structure of the beautiful array.
- Determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.
- Handling edge cases where the array is already non-beautiful or cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        if n <= 2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove
        min_removals = n
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i - 1] == a[i + 1]:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
        
        if min_removals == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_removals)
```

This corrected solution:
- Handles arrays of length 1 or 2 by returning -1.
- Checks if all elements are the same and returns -1 if they are.
- Iterates through the array to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property. If it finds any element that can be removed to break the property, it sets `min_removals` to 1.
- If no such element is found, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the minimum number of elements to remove.
