Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is equal to `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and 0.***
