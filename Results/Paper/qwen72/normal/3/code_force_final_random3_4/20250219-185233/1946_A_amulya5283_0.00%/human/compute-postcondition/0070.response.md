The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array `a`. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` containing the number of operations required for each of the `t` test cases to ensure all elements in the heap are greater than the current median.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element represents the number of operations required to ensure all elements in the corresponding heap are greater than the current median.**
