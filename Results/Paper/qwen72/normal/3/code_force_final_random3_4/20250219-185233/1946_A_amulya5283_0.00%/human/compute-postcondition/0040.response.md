The only variable in the loop head is `heap[0]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the comparison between `heap[0]` and `current_median`. If `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `heap` now contains the element `smallest + 1` at the top, and `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `heap[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` must still be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap[0]` is the top element of the heap, and the heap is a min-heap, the smallest element in the heap is at the top. Therefore, `heap[0]` must be the next smallest element in the heap, which is `smallest + 1`. To ensure the loop condition is met, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `heap[0]` (which is `smallest + 1`), `heap` is now a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` + 1 to the end, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the value of the element that was at the top of the heap before the operation, `heap` now contains the element `smallest + 1` at the top.**
