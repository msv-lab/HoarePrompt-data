Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `heap[0]`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` + 1 to the end, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the value of the element that was at the top of the heap before the operation, `heap` now contains the element `smallest + 1` at the top.**
