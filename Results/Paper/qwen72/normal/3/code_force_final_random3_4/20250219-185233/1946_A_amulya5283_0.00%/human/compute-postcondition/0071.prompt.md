You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the number of operations required for each of the t test cases to ensure all elements in the heap are greater than the current median, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first element of the last tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the last tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are strictly greater than `current_median`, and `operations` is the number of times the loop executed for the last test case.
    return results
    #The program returns the list 'results' containing the number of operations required for each of the t test cases to ensure all elements in the heap are greater than the current median.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element represents the number of operations required to ensure all elements in the corresponding heap are greater than the current median.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list 'results' containing the number of operations required for each of the t test cases to ensure all elements in the heap are greater than the current median.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
