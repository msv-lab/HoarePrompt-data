The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. The value of `n` remains the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is now the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.**
