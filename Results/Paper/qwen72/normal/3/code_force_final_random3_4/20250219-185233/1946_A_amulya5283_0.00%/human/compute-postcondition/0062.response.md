The variables in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, and `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. Since the heap has already been modified by removing the first element (which was equal to `current_median`) and adding `smallest + 1` twice, the current `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, but the first element (which was equal to `current_median`) has been removed and `smallest + 1` has been added twice, `smallest` is the second smallest value in the original heap (which was the value of `current_median` before the first element was removed and `smallest + 1` was added), `operations` is 2, and `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**
