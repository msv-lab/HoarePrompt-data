Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are greater than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

The code snippet `current_median = arr[median_index]` assigns the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr` to the variable `current_median`. Since `median_index` is already calculated as `n // 2`, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `current_median` now holds the value at the middle index of the sorted array `arr`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
