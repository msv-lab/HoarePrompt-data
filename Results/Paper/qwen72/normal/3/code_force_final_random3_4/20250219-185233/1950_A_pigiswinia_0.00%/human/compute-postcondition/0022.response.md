The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'PEAK'. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` but does not influence the content of the `print` statement directly. The conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` are mentioned but are not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is simply printing a constant string 'PEAK', the output will be exactly that string, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **PEAK**
