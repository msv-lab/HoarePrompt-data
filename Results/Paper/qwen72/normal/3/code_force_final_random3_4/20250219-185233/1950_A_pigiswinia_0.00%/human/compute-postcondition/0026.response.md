Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c` provided, if `a` < `b` < `c`, the output is 'STAIRS'. If `a` < `b` > `c`, the output is 'PEAK'. Otherwise, the output is 'NONE'.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `t-1`, which is the last index of the loop. For each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` were provided by the user, and the loop checked the conditions `a` < `b` < `c` and `a` < `b` > `c`. If the first condition was true, 'STAIRS' was printed. If the second condition was true, 'PEAK' was printed. If neither condition was true, 'NONE' was printed. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
