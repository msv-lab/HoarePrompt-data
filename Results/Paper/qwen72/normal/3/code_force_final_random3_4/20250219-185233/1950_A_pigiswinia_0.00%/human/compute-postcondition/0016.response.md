Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the user.
- If the new `a` < new `b` < new `c`, the condition is true.
- Otherwise, the condition (new `a` < new `b` < new `c`) is false.
- If (new `a` < new `b` > new `c`) is true, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition.
- If neither (new `a` < new `b` < new `c`) nor (new `a` < new `b` > new `c`) is true, both conditions are false.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`.
- The initial state describes conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement is a simple output of a constant string, and it does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
