Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the user. If `a` < `b` > `c`, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. If `a` < `b` < `c`, the condition is true. If neither `a` < `b` < `c` nor `a` < `b` > `c` is true, both conditions are false.***
