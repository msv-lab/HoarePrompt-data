Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user. The condition (a < b < c) is false. If (a < b > c) is true, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. Otherwise, the condition (a < b > c) is also false.***
