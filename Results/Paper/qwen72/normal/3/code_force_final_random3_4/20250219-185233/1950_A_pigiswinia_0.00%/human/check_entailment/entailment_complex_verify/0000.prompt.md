You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called in a loop where the loop runs t times, with t being a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each iteration, the function should receive three digits a, b, c as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c` provided, if `a` < `b` < `c`, the output is 'STAIRS'. If `a` < `b` > `c`, the output is 'PEAK'. Otherwise, the output is 'NONE'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then runs a loop `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the function prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After `t` iterations, the function completes and the program returns to the state it was in before the function was called.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits are equal. According to the problem description, if all three digits are the same (e.g., `a = b = c`), the output should be "NONE". However, the current program will incorrectly output "STAIRS" if `a < b < c` and "PEAK" if `a < b > c`. For example, if the input is `1 1 1`, the program will output "STAIRS" instead of "NONE".
