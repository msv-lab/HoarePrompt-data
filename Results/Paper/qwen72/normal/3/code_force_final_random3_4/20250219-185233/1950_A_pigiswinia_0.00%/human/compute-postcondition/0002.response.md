The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user.**
