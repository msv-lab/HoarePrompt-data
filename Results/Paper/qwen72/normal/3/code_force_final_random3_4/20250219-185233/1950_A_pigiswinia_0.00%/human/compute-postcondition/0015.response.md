To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the user.
4. If the new `a` < new `b` < new `c`, the condition is true.
5. Otherwise, the condition (new `a` < new `b` < new `c`) is false.
6. If (new `a` < new `b` > new `c`) is true, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition.
7. If neither (new `a` < new `b` < new `c`) nor (new `a` < new `b` > new `c`) is true, both conditions are false.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

This statement will print the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` or any other conditions. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **PEAK**
