Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, and `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9. `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. If `a` >= `x` + 3, the condition for the loop remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition for the loop also remains unchanged.**
