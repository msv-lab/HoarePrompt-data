Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `_` is a placeholder that will be set by the loop, and `x` is equal to `k - 1`. Additionally, the value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.**
