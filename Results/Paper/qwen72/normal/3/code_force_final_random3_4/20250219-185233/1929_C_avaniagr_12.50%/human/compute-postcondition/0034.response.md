Based on the initial state provided, the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are defined with specific constraints, but the `print` statement does not depend on these variables. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

The loop condition described (`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time) does not affect the `print` statement within the loop, as the `print` statement is independent of the loop's variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward:

Output: **YES**
