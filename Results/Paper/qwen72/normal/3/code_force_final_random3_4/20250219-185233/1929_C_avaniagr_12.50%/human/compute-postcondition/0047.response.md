Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `z` is the result of the loop after `x + 1` iterations, `i` is `x`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- The variable `k` remains an input integer between 2 and 30.
- The variable `x` remains an input integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `a` remains an input integer between 1 and 10^9.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop executes, and it must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
- The variable `z` is updated in each iteration of the loop according to the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. After `x + 1` iterations, `z` will have the final value determined by this formula.
- The variable `i` will be `x` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from 0 to `x` (inclusive), which means `i` will be `x` at the end.
