Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute one more time. If `x` == `k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, regardless of the value of `a`. Otherwise, `z` is set to `x + 1`, `i` is set to `x`, and if `a` >= `z`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` < `z`, the current value of `a` is less than `z`.***
