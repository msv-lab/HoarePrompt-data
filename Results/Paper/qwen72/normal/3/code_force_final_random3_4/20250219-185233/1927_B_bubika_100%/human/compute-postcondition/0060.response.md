Functionality: ** The function `func` handles multiple test cases internally. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list of integers `s` of length `n`. The function constructs and prints a string `r` for each test case, where each character in `r` is determined by the corresponding integer in `s` and a fixed alphabet string `a` ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'). The function does not return any value; it only prints the constructed strings. After the function concludes, the variable `a` remains unchanged, `t` is the number of test cases minus 1, `b` is a list of 26 integers reflecting the frequency of each index in `s` across all test cases, `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, and `s` is the last list of integers input by the user. **
