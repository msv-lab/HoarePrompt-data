Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists at least one valid string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z. The variable `a` is now a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 0, `b` is a list where the elements at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` are incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers, `r` is a string consisting of the characters at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` within the string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the elements at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user, `r` is a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the integers in `s`, in the order they appear in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 2, `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `x` (for each `x` in `s`) is incremented by the number of times that `x` appears in `s`, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user, `r` is a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by `s` in the order they appear in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
