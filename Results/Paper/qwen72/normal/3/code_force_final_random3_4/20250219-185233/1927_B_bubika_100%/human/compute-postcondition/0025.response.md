The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`. For the loop to execute, the list `s` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` will take on the values of the elements in `s` during each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`a`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `r`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one integer, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`**
