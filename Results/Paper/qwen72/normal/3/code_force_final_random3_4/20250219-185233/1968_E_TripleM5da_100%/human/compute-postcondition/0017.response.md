The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. However, since `i` is 0, it indicates that the loop has not yet started (or it has been reset to 0 for some reason).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next value in the range, which is 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
