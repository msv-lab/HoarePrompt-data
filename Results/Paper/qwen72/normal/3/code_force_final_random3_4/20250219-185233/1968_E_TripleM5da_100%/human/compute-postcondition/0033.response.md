Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `t` (the total number of test cases).**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` remains an integer within the range 2 to 10^3. The variable `i` in the loop head will have the value `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations. The values of `n` for each test case remain unchanged, as they are input values that are not modified by the loop.
