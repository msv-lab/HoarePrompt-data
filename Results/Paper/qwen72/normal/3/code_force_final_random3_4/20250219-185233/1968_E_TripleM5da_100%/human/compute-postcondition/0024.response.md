Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

Initial State:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than `i - 1`

Given the initial state, we can deduce the following:
- `i` is defined as `n + 1`
- `n` is an input integer, and it is stated that `n` is greater than `i - 1`. However, since `i` is `n + 1`, `i - 1` is equal to `n`. This creates a contradiction because `n` cannot be greater than itself.

Despite this contradiction, the `print` statement in the code snippet is independent of the initial state and does not use any of the variables `i` or `n`. The `print` statement simply prints the constants `1` and `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1, 1**
