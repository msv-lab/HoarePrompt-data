The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range defined by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute again, the value of `i` must be less than the upper limit of the range, which is `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`. However, for the loop to continue, `n + 1` must be less than `int(input())`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 1`**
