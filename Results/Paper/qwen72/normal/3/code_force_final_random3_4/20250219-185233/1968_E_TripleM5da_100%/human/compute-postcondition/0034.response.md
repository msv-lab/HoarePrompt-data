The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function is designed to handle an input `t` which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, another input `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function should return a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.

Since the specific output for each test case is not provided, we can only infer that the function processes each `n` in the `t` test cases and returns a corresponding result for each `n`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, and for each test case, it processes an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3, returning a result for each `n`.**
