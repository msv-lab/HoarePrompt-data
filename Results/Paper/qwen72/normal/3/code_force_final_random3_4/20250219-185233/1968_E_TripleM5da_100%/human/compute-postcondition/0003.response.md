The given `print` statement is:

```python
print(1, 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The initial state describes that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. This indicates the number of test cases.
2. **Test Cases**: For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. This indicates the range of values `n` can take in each test case.
3. **Variables**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
4. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement is `print(1, 2)`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integers 1 and 2.

### Output:
The `print` statement will always print the integers 1 and 2, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **1 2**
