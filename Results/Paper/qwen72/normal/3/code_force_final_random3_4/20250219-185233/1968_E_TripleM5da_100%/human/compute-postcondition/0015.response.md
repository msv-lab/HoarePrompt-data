The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range starts from 3 and goes up to `n + 1`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, but this will be overridden by the loop to start from 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
