The objects in the loop head are `char` and `encoded`. The loop iterates over each character in the `encoded` string, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `encoded` must be assigned to `char`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters.
- `char` is the second character in `encoded`.
- `decoded` is a list.
- `c` is 97.
- If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` contains the value `mapping[char]`.
- Otherwise, `decoded` contains the character with ASCII value `c`, and `c` is the ASCII value of the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values, or 123 if all lowercase Latin letters are already in `mapping` values.
- If the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values is found, `mapping` is updated such that this letter maps to `char`, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The next character in `encoded` (i.e., the third character) must be assigned to `char`.
- The string `encoded` must still have at least 3 characters for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, and `c` is 97. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` contains the value `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the character with ASCII value `c`, and `c` is the ASCII value of the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values, or 123 if all lowercase Latin letters are already in `mapping` values. If the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values is found, `mapping` is updated such that this letter maps to `char`, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
