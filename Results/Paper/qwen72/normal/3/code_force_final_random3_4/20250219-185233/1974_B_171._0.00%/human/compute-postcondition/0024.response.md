The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. The loop is a `for` loop that iterates over a range of values from the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97) to the ASCII value of 'z' (which is 122) inclusive. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value, which it does by default since `ord('a')` is 97 and `ord('z') + 1` is 123, creating a range from 97 to 122.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The initial state of `c` is 97, which is the starting point of the range, and this is correct.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 97**
