The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. The loop will continue to execute if `c` is within the range from 97 to 122 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97, and the loop will execute if `c` is within the range from 97 to 122 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 98.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 98, and the loop will execute if `c` is within the range from 97 to 122 (inclusive). If the character corresponding to `c` (i.e., `chr(c)`) is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, `mapping` contains the key-value pair where the key is 'a' and the value is the third character in `encoded`, and the loop is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop continues to execute.**
