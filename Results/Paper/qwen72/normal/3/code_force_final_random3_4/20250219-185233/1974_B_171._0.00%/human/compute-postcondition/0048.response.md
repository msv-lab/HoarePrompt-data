Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 98, `mapping` contains the key-value pair where the key is 'b' and the value is the third character in `encoded`, and the loop is broken out of.**

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` adds a key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `c` (which is 'b' since `c` is 98), and the value is `char` (which is the third character in `encoded`). After this assignment, the loop is broken out of because the character 'b' is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
