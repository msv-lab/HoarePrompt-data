Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, and `c` is 97. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` contains the value `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the character with ASCII value `c`, and `c` is the ASCII value of the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values, or 123 if all lowercase Latin letters are already in `mapping` values. If the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values is found, `mapping` is updated such that this letter maps to `char`, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 97, and the loop will execute if `c` is within the range from 97 to 122 (inclusive). If the character corresponding to `c` (i.e., `chr(c)`) is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, `mapping` contains the key-value pair where the key is 'a' and the value is the third character in `encoded`, and the loop is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` (i.e., 'b') is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, `mapping` contains the key-value pair where the key is 'b' and the value is the third character in `encoded`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` (i.e., 'c') is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, `mapping` contains the key-value pair where the key is 'c' and the value is the third character in `encoded`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
