Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` (i.e., 'b') is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, `mapping` contains the key-value pair where the key is 'b' and the value is the third character in `encoded`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues to execute.***
