Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` contains the value `mapping[char]` and `mapping` remains unchanged. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `decoded` now includes the character 'z' at the end, `c` is 123, and if a lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values was found, `mapping` contains a new key-value pair where the key is the first such letter and the value is `char`. If no such letter was found, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
