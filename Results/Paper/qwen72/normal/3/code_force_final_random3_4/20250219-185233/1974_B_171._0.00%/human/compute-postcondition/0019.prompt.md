Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list. `c` is 97.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` (which is 'b') is not present in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `c` is 99, `decoded` is an empty list. If `chr(99)` ('c') is not present in the values of `mapping` and `chr(98)` ('b') is not present in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'c' mapped to `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains an empty dictionary.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
