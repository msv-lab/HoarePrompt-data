Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply calculates the sum of the number of times each installation can launch a firework within the visibility period `m` and adds 2, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The correct output should be `2`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output:
```
2 // 6 + 2 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
```
This happens to be correct for this specific case, but it is not the correct logic.

Consider another input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
The correct output should be `7`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output:
```
10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7
```
Again, this happens to be correct for this specific case, but the logic is still flawed.

Now consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1
```
The correct output should be `4`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output:
```
1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```
This is correct for this specific case, but the logic is still not general.

Finally, consider the input:
```
1
1 2 5
```
The correct output should be `6`, because:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- The second installation launches fireworks at times [0, 2, 4].

At time 0, 2, and 4, there are 2 fireworks visible. At time 1 and 3, there is 1 firework visible. At time 5, there is 1 firework visible. The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2, but since each firework is visible for 6 minutes (m + 1), the total number of fireworks visible at any given time can be 6.

However, the program will output:
```
5 // 1 + 5 // 2 + 2 = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9
```
which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly handle the visibility period and the overlap of fireworks launched by both installations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
