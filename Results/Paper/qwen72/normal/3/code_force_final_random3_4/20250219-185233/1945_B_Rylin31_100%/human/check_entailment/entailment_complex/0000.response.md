Reasoning:

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The issue lies in the calculation of the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The function `func` calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Problem:
- **Firework Launching Intervals**: The first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes, and the second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes.
- **Visibility Duration**: Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after it is launched.
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the following:
1. **Firework Launch Times**: The first installation launches fireworks at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...` and the second installation launches fireworks at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`.
2. **Overlap Calculation**: We need to find the maximum number of times these launch times overlap within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation**: The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the visibility overlap. It simply counts how many times `a` and `b` fit into `m` and adds 2, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.
- **No Consideration of Overlap**: The program does not consider the actual overlap of the visibility windows of the fireworks launched by the two installations.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
2. Calculate the number of times each installation launches fireworks within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes.
3. Determine the maximum overlap by considering the visibility window and the launch intervals.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the least common multiple of a and b
        l = lcm(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        
        # Print the result
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Implementation:
- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of `a` and `b` is used to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
- **Visibility Window Calculation**: We calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes.
- **Overlap Adjustment**: We subtract the number of simultaneous launches (i.e., the number of times the LCM fits into `m + 1`) to avoid double-counting.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the visibility overlap of the fireworks. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
