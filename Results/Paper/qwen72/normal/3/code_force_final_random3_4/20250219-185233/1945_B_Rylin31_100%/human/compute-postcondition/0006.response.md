To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.

The `print` statement:
```
print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

Explanation:
1. `m // a` performs integer division of `m` by `a`, resulting in the largest integer less than or equal to the division.
2. `m // b` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, resulting in the largest integer less than or equal to the division.
3. The sum of `m // a` and `m // b` is then computed.
4. Finally, 2 is added to the sum of `m // a` and `m // b`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(m // a + m // b + 2) (where `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is added to their sum)**
