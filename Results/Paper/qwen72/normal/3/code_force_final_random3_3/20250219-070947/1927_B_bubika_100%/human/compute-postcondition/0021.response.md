Output State: **`t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the string containing the characters from the string `a` at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` concatenated in the order they appear in `s`**

Explanation:
- The variable `b` is reset to a list of 26 zeros.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state.
