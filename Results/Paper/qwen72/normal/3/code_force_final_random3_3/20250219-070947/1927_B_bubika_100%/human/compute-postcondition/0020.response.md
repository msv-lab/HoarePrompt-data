The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the input integer `n`. The loop will execute again if `t` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `t`.

State: **`t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the elements at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the string containing the characters from the string `a` at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` concatenated in the order they appear in `s`**
