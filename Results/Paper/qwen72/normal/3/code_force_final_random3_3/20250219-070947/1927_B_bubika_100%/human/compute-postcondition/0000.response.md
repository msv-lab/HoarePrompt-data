Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

The variable `a` is now a string containing the lowercase English alphabet from 'a' to 'z'. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5 is still valid.
