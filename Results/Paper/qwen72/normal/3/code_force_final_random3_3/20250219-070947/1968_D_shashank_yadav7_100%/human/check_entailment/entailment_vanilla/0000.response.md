### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` and the arrays `p` and `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment**:
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices, which is appropriate for Python lists.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha (`bp` and `sp`) with the values at their starting positions in array `a`.
   - It also initializes the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) for Bodya and Sasha, initially set to their starting scores multiplied by `k`.

4. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by moving them to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively. This is correct because the permutation `p` is 1-based, and we need to convert it to 0-based for list indexing.
   - It updates the scores `bp` and `sp` by adding the values at their new positions in array `a`.
   - It also updates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` by considering the current score plus the maximum possible score from the remaining turns.

5. **Score Comparison**:
   - After simulating the game, the program compares the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the game is a draw.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Update of Maximum Possible Scores**:
  - The program updates `bm` and `sm` using the formula `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the cumulative score over multiple turns correctly. Instead, it should simply accumulate the scores over the turns.
  - The correct approach would be to accumulate the scores `bp` and `sp` over the turns and then compare them directly.

- **Redundant `k -= 1`**:
  - The program decrements `k` in each iteration, but it also breaks the loop when `k` reaches 0. This is redundant because the loop already runs for `k` turns.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the way it updates the maximum possible scores.
- The corrected program correctly accumulates the scores over the `k` turns and compares them to determine the winner.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
