Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)`**. 

The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, and `sp` and `sm` are recalculated based on the new value of `s`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
