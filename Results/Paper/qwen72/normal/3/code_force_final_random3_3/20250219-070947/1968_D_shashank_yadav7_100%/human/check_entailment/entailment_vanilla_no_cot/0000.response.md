Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Possible Scores:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha by using the formula `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. However, this formula is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the players can choose to stay at their current positions or move to the next position in the permutation. The correct approach would be to simulate the game for `k` turns and keep track of the scores based on the actual moves the players can make.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop that iterates `k` times is not correctly implemented. The loop should run exactly `k` times, but the program decrements `k` inside the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if `k` is not fully utilized.

3. **Incorrect Position Updates:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated by `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-indexed, but the positions are 0-indexed. The correct update should be `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` without the `- 1` after the assignment.

4. **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are updated by adding the current position's score, but the program does not correctly simulate the game for `k` turns. It should simulate the game for `k` turns and keep track of the scores based on the actual moves the players can make.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should:
- Simulate the game for `k` turns.
- Track the scores of Bodya and Sasha based on their actual moves.
- Determine the winner based on the final scores after `k` turns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Convert positions to 0-indexed
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            
            # Decide whether to stay or move
            if a[p[b] - 1] > a[b]:
                b = p[b] - 1
            if a[p[s] - 1] > a[s]:
                s = p[s] - 1
        
        # Determine the winner
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Reading:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- **Position Conversion:** The starting positions `b` and `s` are converted to 0-indexed.
- **Score Initialization:** The scores for Bodya and Sasha are initialized to 0.
- **Game Simulation:** The program simulates the game for `k` turns. In each turn, it adds the score at the current position to the respective player's score and then decides whether to stay or move to the next position based on the score at the next position.
- **Winner Determination:** After `k` turns, the program compares the final scores and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
