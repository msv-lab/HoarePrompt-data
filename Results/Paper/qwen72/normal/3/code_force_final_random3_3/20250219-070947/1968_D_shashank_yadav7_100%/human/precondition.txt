t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), P_B and P_S are integers (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), p is a permutation of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), a is an array of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
