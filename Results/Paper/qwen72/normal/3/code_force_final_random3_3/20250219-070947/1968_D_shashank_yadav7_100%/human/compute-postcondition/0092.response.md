Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 2)`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 2)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`, and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `bp` is initially `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.
- The code `bp += a[b]` adds `a[b]` to the current value of `bp`, making `bp` equal to `3 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[b]`.
- However, since `bp` is already `3 * a[b]` in the initial state, the output state reflects this updated value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
