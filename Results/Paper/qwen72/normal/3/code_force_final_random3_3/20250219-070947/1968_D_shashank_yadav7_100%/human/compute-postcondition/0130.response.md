Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * (input integer - 2) + 2 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * (input integer - 1) + sp`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` updates the value of `bm`.
- `bm` is now the maximum of its previous value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `k` is the input integer - 2.
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`.
- The value of `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (input integer - 2) + 2 * a[b]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previous conditions.
