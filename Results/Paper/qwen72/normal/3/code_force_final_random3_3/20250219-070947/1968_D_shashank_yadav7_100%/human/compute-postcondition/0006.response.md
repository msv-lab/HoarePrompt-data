Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `b` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is an input integer minus 1.**

The value of `s` is decremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new value of `s` is the original input integer `s` minus 1.
