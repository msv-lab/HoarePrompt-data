Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0 + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `bp = a[b]` assigns the value of `a[b]` to the variable `bp`.
- The initial state specifies that `b` is the input integer - 1, so `bp` now holds the value of the element in the list `a` at the index `b` (which is `input integer - 1`).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
