Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer less than the input integer, `b` is the final value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (where the number of `p` applications is equal to the number of loop iterations), `s` is the final value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (where the number of `p` applications is equal to the number of loop iterations), `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and `a[p[s] - 1]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0, as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`i`**: This is the index at which the loop either breaks (when `k` becomes 0) or completes (when `i` reaches `n`).
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: This is the input integer minus the number of iterations the loop has executed. If the loop breaks, `k` will be 0.
- **`b`**: This is the result of applying the transformation `p[b] - 1` repeatedly for each iteration of the loop.
- **`s`**: This is the result of applying the transformation `p[s] - 1` repeatedly for each iteration of the loop.
- **`sp`**: This is the sum of the elements in the list `a` at the indices `s` and `p[s] - 1` for each iteration.
- **`bp`**: This is the sum of the elements in the list `a` at the index `b` for each iteration.
- **`bm`**: This is the maximum value of the expression `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` evaluated at each iteration.
- **`sm`**: This is the maximum value of the expression `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` evaluated at each iteration.
