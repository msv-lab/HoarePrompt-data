Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0, or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `k` is 0 or the input integer - `n` if `k` never becomes 0.
   - `b` is the value of `p[p[...[p[b] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1).
   - `s` is the value of `p[p[...[p[s] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1).
   - `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over `n` iterations.
   - `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over `n` iterations.
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over `n` iterations.
   - `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over `n` iterations.
   - `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Draw')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'Draw'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of information about various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string regardless of the values of the variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
