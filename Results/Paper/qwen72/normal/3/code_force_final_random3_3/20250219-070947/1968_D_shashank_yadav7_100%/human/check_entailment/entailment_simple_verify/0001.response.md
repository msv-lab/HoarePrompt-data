### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1 from each.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The scores for Bodya and Sasha are initialized to the values at their starting positions in the array `a`.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for up to `n` iterations, but it decrements `k` in each iteration and breaks when `k` reaches 0. This is a correct approach to ensure the game runs for exactly `k` turns.
   - In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It also updates the scores for both players by adding the value at their current position in the array `a`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha using the formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`. This formula is intended to consider the remaining turns and the current scores, but it is not necessary for the correct solution.
   - The `max` function is used to ensure that the scores are updated correctly based on the remaining turns, but this is not the correct way to simulate the game. The game should be simulated for exactly `k` turns, and the scores should be updated accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - After simulating the game, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores using the formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`. This formula is not correct because it assumes that the player will stay at the same position for the remaining turns, which is not necessarily true.
  - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for exactly `k` turns and keep track of the scores without trying to calculate the maximum possible scores.

- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop terminates after `k` turns, but the loop variable `k` is decremented inside the loop. This is a correct approach to ensure the game runs for exactly `k` turns, but it is not necessary to use a `for i in range(n)` loop. A `for _ in range(k)` loop would be more appropriate and clear.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that simulates the game correctly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bodya_score = a[b]
        sasha_score = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Final Answer:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned in the reasoning. The corrected program should be used to ensure the game is simulated correctly.

Final: **False**
