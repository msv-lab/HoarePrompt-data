Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `i` is 2. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 2 and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is set to 1, and `same` remains 1.***
