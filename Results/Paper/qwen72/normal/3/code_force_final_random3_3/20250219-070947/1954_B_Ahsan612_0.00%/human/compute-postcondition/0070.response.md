Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i`, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous value of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1.**

The code snippet `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `same`.
