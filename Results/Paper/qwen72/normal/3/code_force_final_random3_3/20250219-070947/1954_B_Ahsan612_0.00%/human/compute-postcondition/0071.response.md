Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i`. If `ar[i] == num`, `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 again (total increment of 2), `num` is set to `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous value of `minn` and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.***
