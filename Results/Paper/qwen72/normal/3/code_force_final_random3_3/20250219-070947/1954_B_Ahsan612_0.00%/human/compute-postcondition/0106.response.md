The value of `same` is incremented by 1. The specific value of `same` depends on the initial conditions:

- If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, then `same` was initially 3, so it becomes 4.
- If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar` and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` was initially 2, so it becomes 3.
- If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar` and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` was initially 1, so it becomes 2.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `i`, `minn`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5, `i` is 3 or 4 or 5, `same` is 4 or 3 or 2, `minn` is `inf` or 1, `num` is `ar[2]` or `ar[4]`.**
