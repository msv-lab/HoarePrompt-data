### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly applying the operation of replacing an element at index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`) with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which will count the length of consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar`.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), which will store the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements found.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array `ar` using an index `i`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, the loop updates `num` to the current element, resets `same` to 1, and updates `minn` to the minimum of the current `minn` and `same`.

3. **Final update**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated to the minimum of the current `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence of consecutive identical elements.

4. **Output**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there were no sequences of consecutive identical elements, which is impossible given the problem constraints (the array is guaranteed to be beautiful).
   - Otherwise, the program prints `minn`, which is the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Sequence**:
  - The program incorrectly increments `i` twice when a different element is found (`i += 1` inside the `else` block and then again at the end of the loop). This can cause the loop to skip elements and potentially miss sequences of consecutive identical elements.
  - The logic for updating `minn` is flawed. The program should only update `minn` when it finds a sequence of consecutive identical elements, but it does so even when `i` is incremented incorrectly.

- **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
  - The program does not handle the case where the array has only one element (`n == 1`). According to the problem, such an array is trivially beautiful, and it should output `-1` because it is impossible to make it not beautiful.

- **Correct Approach**:
  - The correct approach should be to find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful.
  - For a single element array, the output should be `-1`.
  - For arrays with multiple elements, the program should correctly identify the minimum sequence length and ensure it is not counting incorrectly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
