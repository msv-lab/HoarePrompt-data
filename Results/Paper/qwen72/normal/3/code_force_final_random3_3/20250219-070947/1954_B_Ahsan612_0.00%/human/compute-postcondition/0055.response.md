Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements. If `ar[1] == num`, then `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is set to `inf`, and `same` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.***
