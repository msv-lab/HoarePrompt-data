The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. The initial state provides two possible scenarios for the value of `same`, depending on the condition `ar[1] == num`. Let's consider both scenarios:

1. If `ar[1] == num`, then `same` is initially 2.
2. If `ar[1] != num`, then `same` is initially 1.

In both cases, `same` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
- If `ar[1] == num`, then `same` becomes 3.
- If `ar[1] != num`, then `same` becomes 2.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. If `ar[1] == num`, then `i` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is set to `inf`, and `same` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 2.**
