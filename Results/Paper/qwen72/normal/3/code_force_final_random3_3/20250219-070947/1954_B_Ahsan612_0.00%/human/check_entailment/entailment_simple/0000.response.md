### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be modified by choosing an index \( i \) (2 ≤ \( i \) ≤ \( |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
   - If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array \( ar \).
   - It initializes `same` to 1, which will count the length of consecutive identical elements.
   - It initializes `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements.
   - It iterates through the array to find sequences of consecutive identical elements and updates `minn` with the minimum length of these sequences.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity, which means no sequences of consecutive identical elements were found. In this case, it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program incorrectly updates `i` and `num` inside the `else` block. It should not increment `i` by 1 before updating `num` and `same`.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array consists of all identical elements correctly. In such a case, it should output -1 because removing any number of elements will not make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Correcting the Program:**
   - The correct approach is to find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements and then determine if removing one element from the smallest sequence can make the array non-beautiful.
   - If the array consists of all identical elements, the program should output -1.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Handling All Identical Elements:**
  - If `minn` is equal to `n`, it means the array consists of all identical elements, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing any number of elements. Therefore, we output -1.
- **Correct Loop Logic:**
  - The loop correctly updates `same` and `num` without unnecessary increments of `i`.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical issues that need to be corrected as explained above. The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct output for all test cases.
