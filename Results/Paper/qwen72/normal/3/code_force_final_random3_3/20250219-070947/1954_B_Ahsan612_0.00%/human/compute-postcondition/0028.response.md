Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 4 or 5, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`.**

The value of `num` is assigned the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Since `i` can be either 4 or 5, `num` will be either `ar[4]` or `ar[5]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
