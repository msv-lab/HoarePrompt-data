Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subsequence of consecutive identical elements in `ar`, and `num` is the last element of `ar`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is an input integer.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and `n`.
- The list `ar` remains unchanged and is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
- The variable `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `same` is reset to 1, as the loop always resets `same` to 1 when it encounters a new element that is different from the current `num`.
- The variable `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subsequence of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar`. This is because the loop updates `minn` with the smallest value of `same` encountered during the iterations.
- The variable `num` is the last element of the list `ar`, as the loop updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]` whenever it encounters a new element. By the end of the loop, `num` will be the last element in `ar`.
