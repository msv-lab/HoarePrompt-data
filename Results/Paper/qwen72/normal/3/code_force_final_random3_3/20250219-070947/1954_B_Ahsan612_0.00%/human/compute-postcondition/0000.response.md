The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the number of iterations. The number of iterations is determined by the input provided to `range(int(input()))`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, the input must be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs at least once. The variable `_` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration, up to the value provided by the input.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the input to the loop must be a positive integer greater than 0**
