To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `ar`.

The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is either 2 or 3.
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.

Let's analyze the two cases:

1. **If `ar[1] == num`**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `num` is the first element of `ar`.
   - `minn` is set to `inf`.
   - `same` is 2.

2. **If `ar[1] != num`**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `num` is the third element of `ar`.
   - `minn` is 1.
   - `same` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- In the first case, `i` is 2, so `i < len(ar)` must be true. This means `len(ar)` must be greater than 2.
- In the second case, `i` is 3, so `i < len(ar)` must be true. This means `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.

Since `ar` is a list with at least 2 elements, the first case is already satisfied. For the second case, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(ar)` to ensure it is greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. If `ar[1] == num`, then `i` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is set to `inf`, and `same` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.**
