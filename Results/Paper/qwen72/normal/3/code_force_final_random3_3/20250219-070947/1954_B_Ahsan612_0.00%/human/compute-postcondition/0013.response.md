Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`.**

The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value (infinity) and the value of `same` (1). Since 1 is less than infinity, `minn` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
