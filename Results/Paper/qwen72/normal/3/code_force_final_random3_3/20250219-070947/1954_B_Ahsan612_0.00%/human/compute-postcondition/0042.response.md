Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1, and `same` is 1. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1, and it is not equal to infinity.**

The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `ar` with a new list of integers provided by the user. The length of `ar` is now the number of integers input by the user, and the last element of `ar` is assigned to `num`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `minn`, and `same`) remain unchanged. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it is updated to 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1, and it is not equal to infinity.
