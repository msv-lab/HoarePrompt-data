Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4, `same` is increased by 1.**

The value of `same` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `same` is unknown. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
