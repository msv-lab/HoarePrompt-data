The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `ar`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Since `ar` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` being 2 means that the loop can execute one more time if `ar` has more than 2 elements. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to `i` for the loop to proceed, as long as `ar` has more than 2 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `num` remains equal to the first element of `ar`, and `minn` is infinity. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `i` is 2.**
