You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements in `ar`, and `same` is 1. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it is updated to the length of the first sequence of consecutive identical elements found in `ar`. If no such sequence is found, `minn` remains `inf` and the output is `-1`. Otherwise, `minn` is not equal to `inf` and the output is the value of `minn`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - An array is called "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful. If it's impossible, output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum count of consecutive elements seen so far.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the program will output 1, which is correct.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where all elements are the same, outputting -1.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `same` seems to be flawed. Specifically, the `i += 1` inside the `else` block is incorrect because it skips the next element without checking it.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - The `i += 1` inside the `else` block should be removed to ensure that the next element is checked correctly.
   - The program should also handle the case where the array is already not beautiful more robustly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        for i in range(1, len(ar)):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical issue in the loop where it skips elements incorrectly.
- The corrected program addresses this issue and should correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the logical issue in the loop. The corrected program is provided above.)
