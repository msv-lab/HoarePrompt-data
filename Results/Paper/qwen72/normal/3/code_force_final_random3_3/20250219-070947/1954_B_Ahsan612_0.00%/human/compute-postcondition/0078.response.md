To determine what will be printed by the `print(minn)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, which means `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.
   - `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements in `ar`.
   - `minn` is not equal to infinity.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, and it has at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is the length of `ar`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.
   - `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements in `ar`. For example, if `ar` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `same` would be 3 because the last sequence of identical elements is `[3, 3, 3]`.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must have a finite value.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`.
   - `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`.
   - Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it will be a finite integer.
   - The exact value of `minn` depends on the initial value of `minn` and the value of `same`.

Given the information, the output will be the minimum value between the initial `minn` and the count of the last sequence of identical elements in `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum of the previous minn and the count of the last sequence of identical elements in ar)**
