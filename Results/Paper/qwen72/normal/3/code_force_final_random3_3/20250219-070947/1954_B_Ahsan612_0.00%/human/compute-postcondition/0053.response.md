Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 1).
- Since `inf` is greater than 1, `minn` is now set to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
