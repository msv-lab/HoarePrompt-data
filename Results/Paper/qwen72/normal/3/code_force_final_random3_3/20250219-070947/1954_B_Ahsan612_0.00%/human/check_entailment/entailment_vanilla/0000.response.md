### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - An array is called "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful. If it's impossible, output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum count of consecutive elements seen so far.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the program will output 1, which is correct.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where all elements are the same, outputting -1.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `same` seems to be flawed. Specifically, the `i += 1` inside the `else` block is incorrect because it skips the next element without checking it.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - The `i += 1` inside the `else` block should be removed to ensure that the next element is checked correctly.
   - The program should also handle the case where the array is already not beautiful more robustly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        for i in range(1, len(ar)):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical issue in the loop where it skips elements incorrectly.
- The corrected program addresses this issue and should correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the logical issue in the loop. The corrected program is provided above.)
