Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` and the value 2, `arr` must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r_y = num % y` updates the value of `r_y` to be the result of `num % y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- `r_x` is still the result of `-num % x`.
- `current_key` is still a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y`.
- `residue_map` still contains the key `current_key` with the value 2.
- `count` is still the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`.
- `test_cases` is still a list of tuples with at least one tuple.
- `results` is still an empty list.
- `(n, x, y, arr)` is still the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` still has at least three elements.
- `num` is still the third element of `arr`.
