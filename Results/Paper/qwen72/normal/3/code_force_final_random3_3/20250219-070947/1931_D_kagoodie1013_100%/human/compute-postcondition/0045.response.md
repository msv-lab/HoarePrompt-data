Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of pairs in `arr` that have the same `(num % x, num % y)` residues as any previous elements, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` and each value is the count of how many times this tuple appears in `arr`, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element, and `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop:
- The `test_cases` list is still the same as it was initially.
- The `results` list now contains the final value of `count`, which is the total number of pairs in `arr` that share the same residues `(num % x, num % y)` with any previous elements in `arr`.
- The `residue_map` dictionary has keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)`, and each key's value is the count of how many times this tuple appears in `arr`.
- The `arr` list still contains all its original elements.
- The `num` variable holds the last element of `arr`.
- The `r_x` variable holds the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `r_y` variable holds the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `current_key` variable holds the tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element of `arr`.
