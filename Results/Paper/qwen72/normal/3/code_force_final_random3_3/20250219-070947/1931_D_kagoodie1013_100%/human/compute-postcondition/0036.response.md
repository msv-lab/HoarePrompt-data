Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 1, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value found in `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)`. Since `residue_map` has `current_key` mapped to 1, and `current_key` is the same as `(r_x, r_y)`, `count` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
