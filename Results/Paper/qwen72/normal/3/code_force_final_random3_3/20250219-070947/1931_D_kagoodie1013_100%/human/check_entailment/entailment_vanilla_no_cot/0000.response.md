Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem. The issue lies in how the residues are being used to count the pairs. Specifically, the program uses a single residue map to track the residues of the elements modulo `x` and `y`, but it incorrectly calculates the residues and updates the map.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Residue Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`. However, the correct residues to check for a beautiful pair should be `num % x` and `num % y` for both the sum and the difference conditions. The use of `-num % x` is incorrect because it does not correctly capture the residue needed for the sum condition.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The program increments the count using `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should involve checking the residues of the current number and the potential pair number to ensure both conditions are met.

3. **Map Update**:
   - The program updates the map with `current_key = (num % x, num % y)`, which is correct for storing the residues, but the logic for counting pairs is flawed.

To fix this, the program should correctly calculate the residues and use a more appropriate method to count the pairs. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs of indices and checks the conditions directly, which is more straightforward and correct. However, it may not be the most efficient solution for large inputs, but it correctly implements the logic as required by the problem.
