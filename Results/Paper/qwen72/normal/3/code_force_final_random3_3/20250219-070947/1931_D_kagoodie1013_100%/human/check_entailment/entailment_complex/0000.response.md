Reasoning:

The program reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes it into a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function `func_1` then processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read and split into test cases. Each test case is stored as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in the `test_cases` list, which is then passed to `func_1`.

2. **Residue Calculation**: The function `func_1` uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the array elements. For each element `num` in `arr`, it calculates:
   - `r_x` as `-num % x` (the negative residue of `num` modulo `x`).
   - `r_y` as `num % y` (the positive residue of `num` modulo `y`).

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: The program counts the number of beautiful pairs by checking if the current pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before in the `residue_map`. If it has, it adds the count of such pairs to the `count` variable. Then, it updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Output**: The function returns a list of results, where each result is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and the `residue_map` is reset for each test case.

However, there is a subtle issue in the residue calculation:
- The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is mathematically correct but can be simplified to `x - num % x` to avoid potential confusion with negative residues. This is because `-num % x` will always yield a non-negative result in Python, but it might be clearer to use `x - num % x`.

Despite this, the logic of the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
