Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
