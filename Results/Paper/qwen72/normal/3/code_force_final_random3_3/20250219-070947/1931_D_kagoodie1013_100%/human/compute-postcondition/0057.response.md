Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` and the value 1, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation:
- The code `r_x = -num % x` updates the value of `r_x` to be the result of `-num % x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- `r_x` is now specifically `-num % x`, and `r_y` remains `num % y`.
- `current_key` is still a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`.
- The `test_cases` list, `results` list, `count`, `residue_map`, and `arr` are all unchanged.
