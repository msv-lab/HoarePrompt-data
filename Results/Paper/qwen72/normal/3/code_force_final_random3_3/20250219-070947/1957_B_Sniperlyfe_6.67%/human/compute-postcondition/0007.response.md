To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. In a `for` loop using `range(n)`, the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

2. **Variable `n`:** The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again with `i` now being 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

The other variables (`nums`, `k`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. However, their values will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the second element now initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `k` is now `k - 2 * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**
