Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `nums` is a list of length `n` where all elements are initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element which is now `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, and `k` is now `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains the same.
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- The list `nums` remains of length `n`, and all elements except the last one remain initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The last element of `nums` (i.e., `nums[-1]`) is incremented by `k`, making it `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged from the initial state, which is `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
