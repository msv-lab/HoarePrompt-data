Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the program is flawed in the way it checks for the minimum number of invitations required. The condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` is not a general solution for determining the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
The correct output should be `3` because Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly identifies a case where `v[v[v[i]]] == i` holds true, leading to an incorrect result.

The program should instead consider the structure of the best friend relationships and determine the smallest set of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend. This involves identifying cycles or chains in the best friend relationships and ensuring that at least one friend from each cycle or chain is invited. The current logic does not do this correctly.
