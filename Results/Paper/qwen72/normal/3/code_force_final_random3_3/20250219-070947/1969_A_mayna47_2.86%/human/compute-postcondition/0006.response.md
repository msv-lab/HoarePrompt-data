The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1` (exclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. However, since the state already specifies that `n` is not equal to 2 and is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3. The variable `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1**
