Postcondition: ***The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct). The function is called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). `n` is an input integer, and `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the input integers, with an additional 0 at the beginning. If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is set to `n + 1`, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.***
