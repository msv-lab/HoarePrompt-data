Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n`, representing the best friends of each friend. For each test case, if `n` is 2, it prints 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and there exists any friend `i` such that the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints 3. The function is designed to be called multiple times with different test cases. **
