### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1 to match the 1-based indexing in the problem.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If there are only 2 friends, the program directly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. This is correct.

4. **Checking for Cycles**:
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, which means that the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints `2` and returns, as inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure both come to the party. This is also correct.

5. **Default Case**:
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints `3`.
   - The idea here is that if there are no cycles of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because inviting 3 friends will always ensure at least 2 of them come, given the constraints of the problem.

### Analysis:
- **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly identifies cycles of length 3 by checking `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This is a valid approach because if such a cycle exists, inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure both come to the party.
- **Special Case for `n == 2`**: The program correctly handles the special case where there are only 2 friends.
- **Default Case**: The program correctly prints `3` if no cycle of length 3 is found. This is because in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come is indeed 3.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
