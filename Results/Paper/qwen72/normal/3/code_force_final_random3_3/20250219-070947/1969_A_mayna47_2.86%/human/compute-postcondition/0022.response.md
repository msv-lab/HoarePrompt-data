The function `func_1` is described with an incomplete signature in the provided example. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it seems the function should accept two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function is expected to be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000).

Given the output cases, it appears that the function does not return any value in all provided cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct). It processes the data related to the best friends of each friend and does not return any value.**
