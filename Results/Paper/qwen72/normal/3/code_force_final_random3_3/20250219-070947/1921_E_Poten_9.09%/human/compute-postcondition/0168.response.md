The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `answers`. If the list has at least three results, the loop will execute again for the third result. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` is a list containing at least two results, and `j` is the second result in the `answers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least three results, and `j` will be the third result in the `answers` list.

State: **`answers` is a list containing at least three results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the third result in the `answers` list**
