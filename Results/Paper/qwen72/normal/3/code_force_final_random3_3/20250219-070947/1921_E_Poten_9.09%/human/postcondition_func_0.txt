The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It determines the outcome of each test case based on the relative positions and values of `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`, and prints the result for each test case, which can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input values and the number of test cases remain unchanged, and the results of all test cases have been printed.
