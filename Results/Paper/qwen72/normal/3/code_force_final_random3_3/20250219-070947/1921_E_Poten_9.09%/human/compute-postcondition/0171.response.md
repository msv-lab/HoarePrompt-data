The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The function does not explicitly accept these parameters in its definition but is expected to read them from a predefined method or variable. The constraints for these integers are as follows: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input values. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the problem description, so we can only describe the general functionality in terms of the input and the expected output format.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints and relationships between the input values.**
