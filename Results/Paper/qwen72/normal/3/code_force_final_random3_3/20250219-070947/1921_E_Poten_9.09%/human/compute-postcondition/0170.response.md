Output State: **All results in the `answers` list have been printed.**

Natural language description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every result in the `answers` list (whether 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') has been printed to the console. The loop has completed, and no more results are left to be printed. The state of the `answers` list remains unchanged, and the values of `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` are also unchanged.
