Postcondition: **`answers` is a list, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged. `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, `answers` contains 'Bob' if `clues[3] == clues[5]`, or 'Draw' if certain conditions based on the differences between `clues` elements are met, otherwise it contains 'Bob'. If `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd, or `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, `answers` contains 'Alice' if `clues[3] == clues[5]` or if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less and certain conditions based on the differences between `clues` elements are not met. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and certain conditions based on the differences between `clues` elements are met.**
