Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable, as the function definition provided does not include any parameters. However, based on the problem description, the input should consist of multiple test cases, each containing six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `test_cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
