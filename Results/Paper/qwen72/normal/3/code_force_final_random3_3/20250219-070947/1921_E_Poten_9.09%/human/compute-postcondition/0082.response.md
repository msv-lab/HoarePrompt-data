Output State: **`answers` is a list, `test_cases` must be greater than 1, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.** 

The code snippet `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `clues`. The other variables remain unchanged.
