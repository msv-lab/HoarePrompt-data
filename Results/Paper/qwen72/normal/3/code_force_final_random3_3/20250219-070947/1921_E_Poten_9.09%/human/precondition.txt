h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. Additionally, t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
