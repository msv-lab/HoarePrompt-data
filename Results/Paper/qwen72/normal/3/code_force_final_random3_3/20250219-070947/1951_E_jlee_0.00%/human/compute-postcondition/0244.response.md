Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
   - `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1.
   - `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is not changed. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 or greater and `done` is not changed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j], string[j:])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `j` is set to 1.
   - `string[:j]` will slice the string `string` from the start up to (but not including) the index `j`. Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will slice the string `string` from index `j` to the end. Since `j` is 1, `string[j:]` will be the string `string` starting from the second character to the end.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The first part of the print statement, `string[:j]`, will print the first character of `string`.
   - The second part of the print statement, `string[j:]`, will print the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Therefore, the output will be the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
