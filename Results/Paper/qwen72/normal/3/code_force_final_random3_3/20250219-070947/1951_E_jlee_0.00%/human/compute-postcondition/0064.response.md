Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0. If `count` > 1, `done` is True and `count2` is equal to `count`. If `count` is 1, `done` is False and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
