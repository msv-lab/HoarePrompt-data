The given `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, `j`, or `count`.

Output: **YES**
