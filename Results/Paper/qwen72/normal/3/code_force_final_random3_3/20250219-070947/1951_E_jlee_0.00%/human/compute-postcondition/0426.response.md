Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, and `j` is 2. If `count` > 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is incremented by 2, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` equals `count` and `count` > 1, or if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than or equal to 0, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
