The function `func` reads an integer `t` and a list of `t` strings from the input. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of substrings (1 or 2) and the substrings themselves. If the string cannot be split in this manner, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` strings, the function concludes, and the final state of the program includes the input variables `t` and `string` as they were last read, and the internal variables `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, and `done` as they were last modified during the processing of the last string.
