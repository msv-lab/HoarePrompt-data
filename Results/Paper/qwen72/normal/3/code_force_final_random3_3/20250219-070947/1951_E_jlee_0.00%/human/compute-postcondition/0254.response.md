Based on the provided initial state and the Python code snippet, the `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

The initial state describes several variables and their conditions:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
- `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is 0 or greater.
- `done` is a boolean.

However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
