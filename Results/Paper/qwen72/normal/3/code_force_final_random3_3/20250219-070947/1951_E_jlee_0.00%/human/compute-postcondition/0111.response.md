Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 1. If `count` > 0, `count2` is 0 or 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, or if `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, or if `count2` > `count`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `done` remains False. If `count` <= 0, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0.***
