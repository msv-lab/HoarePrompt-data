Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `x` after `count` is set, or 0 if `count` is 0, and `done` is False. If `done` is False, the program maintains the initial state of all variables.**
