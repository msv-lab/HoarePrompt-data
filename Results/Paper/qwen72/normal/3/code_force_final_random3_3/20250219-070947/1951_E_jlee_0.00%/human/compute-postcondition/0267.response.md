Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
   - `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 3.
   - `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `count` is 0 or greater.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 2 and `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state provides conditions and variable values, but none of these conditions or values affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
