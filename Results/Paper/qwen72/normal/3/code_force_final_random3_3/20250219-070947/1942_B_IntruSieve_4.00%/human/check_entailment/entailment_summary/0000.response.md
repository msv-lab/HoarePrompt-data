### Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly constructs the permutation `p`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is an empty list that will store the constructed permutation.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the smallest non-negative integer not yet in `mex`.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, representing the largest value in `mex`.

2. **Loop through the input array `arr`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive:
       - Add `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increment `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, increment both `minn` and `maxx` by 1.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive:
       - Add `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
       - Update `maxx` to the maximum of `maxx` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline.

### Analysis:

- **Positive `arr[i]`**:
  - When `arr[i]` is positive, it implies that \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) \) is greater than `p_i`. The smallest non-negative integer not yet in `mex` (i.e., `minn`) is added to `mex`, and `minn` is incremented.
  - This ensures that the smallest possible value is used for `p_i`, which is consistent with the MEX definition.

- **Non-positive `arr[i]`**:
  - When `arr[i]` is non-positive, it implies that \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) \) is less than or equal to `p_i`. The value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is added to `mex`.
  - This value is chosen to ensure that the MEX condition is satisfied. For example, if `arr[i] = -2` and `minn = 0`, then `abs(-2 - 0) = 2` is added to `mex`, which means `p_i = 2` and \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) = 0 \), making \( a_i = 0 - 2 = -2 \).

- **Updating `maxx`**:
  - `maxx` is updated to the maximum of `maxx` and the value added to `mex` to ensure that the largest value in `mex` is correctly tracked.

### Verification with Example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `n = 5`, `arr = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
  - Explanation:
    - `arr[0] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [0]`)
    - `arr[1] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [0, 1]`)
    - `arr[2] = -2`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 \) (valid, `mex = [0, 1, 4]`)
    - `arr[3] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [0, 1, 4, 2]`)
    - `arr[4] = 2`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 \) (valid, `mex = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `n = 5`, `arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Output: `0 1 2 3 4`
  - Explanation:
    - `arr[0] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [0]`)
    - `arr[1] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [0, 1]`)
    - `arr[2] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [0, 1, 2]`)
    - `arr[3] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [0, 1, 2, 3]`)
    - `arr[4] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `n = 3`, `arr = [-2, 1, 2]`
  - Output: `2 0 1`
  - Explanation:
    - `arr[0] = -2`: \( \texttt{MEX}(2) - 2 = -2 \) (valid, `mex = [2]`)
    - `arr[1] = 1`: \( \texttt{MEX}(2, 0) - 0 = 1 \) (valid, `mex = [2, 0]`)
    - `arr[2] = 2`: \( \texttt{MEX}(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2 \) (valid, `mex = [2, 0, 1]`)
