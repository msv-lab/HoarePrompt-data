Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def construct_permutation(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is an empty list. `minn` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `minn` is assigned the value 0.
- The initial state information about the function `func_1`, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`, and `mex` remains unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial state information plus the updated value of `minn`.
