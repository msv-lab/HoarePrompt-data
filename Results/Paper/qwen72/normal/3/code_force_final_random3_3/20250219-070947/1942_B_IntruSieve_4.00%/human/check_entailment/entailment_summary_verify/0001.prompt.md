You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user. It then constructs a new list `mex` based on the conditions in the loop. For each element in the input list `arr`, if the element is positive, the smallest non-negative integer not yet in `mex` is added to `mex`. If the element is non-positive, the absolute difference between the element and the smallest non-negative integer not yet in `mex` is added to `mex`. After constructing the `mex` list, it prints each element of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the original `n` and `arr`, the constructed `mex` list, and the updated values of `minn` and `maxx`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the current minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `arr[i]` of the array `a`.
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `arr[i]` is positive, it suggests that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `minn`, and the value `p[i]` is `minn - arr[i]`, which is `minn` since `arr[i]` is positive.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This is because if `arr[i]` is negative, it suggests that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `p[i] + arr[i]`, and the value `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `mex`, the program prints the elements of `mex`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr[i]` is positive by appending the current `minn` and incrementing it.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr[i]` is negative by appending `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and updating `maxx` if necessary.
   - The program ensures that the values in `mex` are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle the edge case where `arr` is all positive or all negative.
   - The program should handle the case where `arr` is a mix of positive and negative values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. It handles both positive and negative values in `arr` and ensures that the permutation is valid. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
