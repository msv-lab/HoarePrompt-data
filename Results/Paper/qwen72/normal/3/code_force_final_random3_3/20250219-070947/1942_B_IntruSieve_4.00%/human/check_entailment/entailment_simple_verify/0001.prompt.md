You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

The correct function definition should be `def construct_permutation(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the current minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `arr[i]` of the array `a`.
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `arr[i]` is positive, it suggests that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `minn`, and the value `p[i]` is `minn - arr[i]`, which is `minn` since `arr[i]` is positive.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This is because if `arr[i]` is negative, it suggests that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `p[i] + arr[i]`, and the value `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `mex`, the program prints the elements of `mex`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr[i]` is positive by appending the current `minn` and incrementing it.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr[i]` is negative by appending `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and updating `maxx` if necessary.
   - The program ensures that the values in `mex` are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle the edge case where `arr` is all positive or all negative.
   - The program should handle the case where `arr` is a mix of positive and negative values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. It handles both positive and negative values in `arr` and ensures that the permutation is valid. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
