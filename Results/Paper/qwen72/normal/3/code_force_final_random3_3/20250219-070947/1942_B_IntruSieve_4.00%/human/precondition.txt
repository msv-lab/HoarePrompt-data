The function `what_the_mex` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and an array a of length n, where each element a_i satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The input is structured such that the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t test cases. For each test case, the first line contains n, and the second line contains the elements of a. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
