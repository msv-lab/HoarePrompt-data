Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's break down the variables and objects to determine what will be printed:

- `n` is the same as the initial `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where \(-n \leq a_i \leq n\)).
- `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user.
- `mex` is a list of integers that has been fully printed.
- `itm` is the last element in `mex`.
- `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used.
- `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print()
```

This `print` statement does not contain any arguments, so it will simply print a newline character.

Output: **(a newline character)**
