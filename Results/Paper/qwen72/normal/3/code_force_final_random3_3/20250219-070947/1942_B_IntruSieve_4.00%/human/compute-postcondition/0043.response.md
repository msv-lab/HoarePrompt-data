Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that has been fully printed, `itm` is the last element in `mex`, `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used, and `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `i`, `t`, `test_cases`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The list `mex` has been fully printed, and `itm` is the last element in `mex`. The variable `minn` still represents the next integer that has not been added to `mex`, or it is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used. The variable `maxx` remains the maximum value in the `mex` list.
