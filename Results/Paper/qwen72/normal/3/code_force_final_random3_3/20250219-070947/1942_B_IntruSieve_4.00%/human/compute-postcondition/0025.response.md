Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)], `minn` is either 1 or 0, and `maxx` is `abs(arr[1] - minn)` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)`.***
