Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `minn` is either 5 or 4 or 3 or 2 or 1, `maxx` is either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, and `mex` is a list containing either [0, 1] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), 0] or [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)] with `minn` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`.
- If `maxx` was 0, `minn` becomes 1.
- If `maxx` was `abs(arr[0] - minn)`, `minn` becomes `abs(arr[0] - minn) + 1`.
- If `maxx` was `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `minn` becomes `abs(arr[1] - minn) + 1`.
- Therefore, `minn` can now be either 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1, depending on the initial value of `maxx`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `test_cases`, `arr`, and `mex` remain unchanged.
