Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either [0, 1] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), 0], `minn` is either 3 or 2, and `maxx` is either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)`. If `arr[0]` is greater than 0, `mex` is [0, 1], `minn` is 3, and `maxx` is 0. If `arr[0]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is [abs(arr[0] - minn), 0], `minn` is 2, and `maxx` is either `abs(arr[0] - minn)` if `abs(arr[0] - minn)` is greater than the initial `maxx`, or remains the initial `maxx` otherwise.**
