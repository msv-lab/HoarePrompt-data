To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `itm` and `mex`. The loop will execute if `mex` is not an empty list. The state of `itm` is not something we need to adjust directly; it will be assigned the values from `mex` during the loop execution.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is the same as the initial `n`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n)
- `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user
- `mex` is a list of integers that has been constructed based on the conditions in the loop
- `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used
- `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list

For the loop to execute, `mex` must contain at least one element. The state of `itm` will be the first element of `mex` when the loop starts.

State: **`n` is the same as the initial `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `itm` is the first element in `mex`, `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used, and `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list**
