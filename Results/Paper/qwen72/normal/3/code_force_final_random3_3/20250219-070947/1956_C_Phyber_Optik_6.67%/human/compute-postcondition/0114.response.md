Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `r` must be a non-negative integer.
- `j` is greater than `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`2`**: This is a constant integer value. It will be printed as is.
2. **`j % n`**: This is the modulo operation, which calculates the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Since `j` is greater than `n` (as per the precondition), `j % n` will be a non-negative integer less than `n`.
3. **`end=' '`**: This parameter in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `2`, followed by the result of `j % n`, and end with a space.

Since `j` is greater than `n`, the value of `j % n` will be a non-negative integer less than `n`. However, without the exact values of `j` and `n`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `j % n`.

Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder when j is divided by n, and j is greater than n)**
