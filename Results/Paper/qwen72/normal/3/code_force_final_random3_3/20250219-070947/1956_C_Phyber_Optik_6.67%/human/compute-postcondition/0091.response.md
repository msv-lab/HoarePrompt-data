Postcondition: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, and the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `n`.**

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, and `r` is 0.
- The if condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to the sum of the first `n` positive integers (which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`) being greater than `n`.
- Since `i` is 1, `i * n` is simply `n`.
- Therefore, the postcondition includes all the conditions from the precondition and adds the condition that the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `n`.
