The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n` and `r` is 0.**
