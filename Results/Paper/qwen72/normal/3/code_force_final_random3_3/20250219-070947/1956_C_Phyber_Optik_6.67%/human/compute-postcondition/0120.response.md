Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is updated to `j + 1`.
   - The condition `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` is true.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to the `print` function is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - The `end=' '` argument ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determining the Value of `j % n`:**
   - Since `j` is updated to `j + 1` before the print statement, we need to consider the value of `j` after this update.
   - The condition `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` implies that `j` is within the range `[0, n + r]` after the update.
   - Therefore, `j % n` will be the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`, which will be a value between `0` and `n-1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output `2` followed by the value of `j % n`, and the output will end with a space.

Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder when j is divided by n, and j is within the range [0, n + r] after being updated to j + 1)**
