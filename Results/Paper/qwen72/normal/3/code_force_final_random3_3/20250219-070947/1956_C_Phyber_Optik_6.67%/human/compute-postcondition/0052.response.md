Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 0), `i` is 1, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, and `j` is `n + 1`. Additionally, `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**

The value of `sum` is updated to `i * n`, which is `1 * n` since `i` is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
