Output State: **`j`, `t`, `_`, `n` retain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `r` is equal to `i + 1`.**

The value of `r` is assigned to be equal to the updated value of `i`, which is `i + 1`. The other variables (`j`, `t`, `_`, `n`) retain their initial values, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` still holds true.
