### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either set a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the matrix size \( n \).
   - It initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) and updates `sum` and `r` based on the condition \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \).
   - It prints the calculated `sum` and `n + r`.
   - It prints the operations: for the first \( n \) operations, it sets each row to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \). For the next \( r \) operations, it sets each column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Correctness of the Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation is based on the condition \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \). This condition is not necessary for maximizing the sum.
   - The maximum sum is achieved by setting each element of the matrix to the maximum possible value in the permutation, which is \( n \). Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n \).

4. **Correctness of the Operations:**
   - The program prints \( n \) row operations and \( r \) column operations.
   - The number of operations \( n + r \) is not necessarily the correct number of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The correct approach is to set each row to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) and then set each column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which will ensure that each element in the matrix is \( n \).

5. **Correct Output:**
   - The correct output should be the maximum sum \( n^3 \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - The operations should be \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or the number of operations required. It uses an unnecessary condition and does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

**Correctness: False**
