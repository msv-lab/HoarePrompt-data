Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `n + r` must be at least 1.
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, the range will always start from 1 and end at `n`.
- The output will be a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

### Example:
- If `n` is 5, the range will be `range(1, 6)`, which generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The `print` statement will output: `1 2 3 4 5`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer and must be greater than 0)**
