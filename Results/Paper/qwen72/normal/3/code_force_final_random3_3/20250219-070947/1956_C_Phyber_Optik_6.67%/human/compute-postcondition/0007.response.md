Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, `i` is 1, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**

The value of `sum` is updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
