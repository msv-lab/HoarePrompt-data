The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a conventional placeholder in Python, indicating that the value is not used within the loop body. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted, but it will start from 0 and iterate `t` times.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
