Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `sum` is 0.
- `r` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- The sum of the first `n` positive integers (which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`) is greater than `i * n`.
