Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is 2, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 2.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The value of `sum` and the condition for `r` (whether `r` is 1 or 0) are still valid based on the initial state, but `r` is now explicitly 2.
