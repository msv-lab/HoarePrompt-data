Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `n + r` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Calculating `j % n`:**
   - `j` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j % n` is `(n + 1) % n`.
   - The modulo operation `(n + 1) % n` will always result in `1` because `n + 1` is one more than `n`, and the remainder when `n + 1` is divided by `n` is `1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `2` followed by `1` and end with a space.

Output: **2 1**
