Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, `j` is `n + 1`, and the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `n`.**

The value of `r` is now 1, as it has been assigned the value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
