Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 0), `i` is `n`, `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `j` is `n + r + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer, which must be greater than 0.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `sum`, `r`, and `j` are not directly affected by the code snippet, so they remain as they were in the initial state. However, the value of `i` is still `n`, and `j` is still `n + r + 1`, where `r` depends on the new value of `n`.
