The function `func` does not take any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases `t` is also an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The function reads these inputs from standard input and outputs the results to standard output.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. It processes each test case and outputs the results to standard output.**
