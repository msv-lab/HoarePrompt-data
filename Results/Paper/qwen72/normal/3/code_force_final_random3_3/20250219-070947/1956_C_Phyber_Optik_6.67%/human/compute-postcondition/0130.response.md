Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `i` is `n`, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` for the last test case, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for the last test case, and `j` is `n + r + 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- After all iterations, the loop variable `_` will be `t - 1` because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.
- `n` will be the last input integer provided for the final test case.
- `i` will be equal to `n` because the inner loop runs from 1 to `n`, and `i` is set to `n` at the end of the inner loop.
- `sum` will be the total sum of the values calculated in the inner loop for the last test case. Specifically, it will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `r` will be the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for the last test case, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `j` will be `n + r + 1` because the outer loop has completed, and the inner loop has run to completion, setting `j` to `n + r + 1` for the last test case.
