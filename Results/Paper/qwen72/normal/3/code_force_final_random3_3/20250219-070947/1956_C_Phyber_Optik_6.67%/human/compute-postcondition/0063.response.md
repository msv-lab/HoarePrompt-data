Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n` and `r` is 0. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and the condition is evaluated in the else part, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n` and `r` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and the condition is evaluated in the else part, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n + 3 * n` and `r` is 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` and the condition is evaluated in the else part, then `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n + 3 * n` and `r` is 0.***
