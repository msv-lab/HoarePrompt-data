You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input, where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the following rules: If `n` is odd, it prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even, it prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than the regular price for two yogurts `2 * a`, but the number of yogurts `n` is odd. In such a case, the program may not always return the minimum cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 5 9
```
- The number of yogurts `n` is 5.
- The price of one yogurt `a` is 5.
- The promotion price for two yogurts `b` is 9.

The correct minimum cost should be:
- Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price: 9 burles.
- Buy 2 more yogurts at the promotion price: 9 burles.
- Buy 1 yogurt at the regular price: 5 burles.
- Total cost: 9 + 9 + 5 = 23 burles.

However, the program will output:
- `n // 2 * b + a` = 2 * 9 + 5 = 23 burles.

This is correct, but consider another case:
```
1
5 5 8
```
- The number of yogurts `n` is 5.
- The price of one yogurt `a` is 5.
- The promotion price for two yogurts `b` is 8.

The correct minimum cost should be:
- Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price: 8 burles.
- Buy 2 more yogurts at the promotion price: 8 burles.
- Buy 1 yogurt at the regular price: 5 burles.
- Total cost: 8 + 8 + 5 = 21 burles.

However, the program will output:
- `n // 2 * b + a` = 2 * 8 + 5 = 21 burles.

This is correct, but the logic is flawed. The program should always check if buying the last yogurt at the regular price is cheaper than buying an extra promotion pack. The correct logic should be to always buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buy the remaining yogurts at the regular price if it is cheaper.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)
```

This ensures that the program always buys the yogurts in the most cost-effective way, regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.
