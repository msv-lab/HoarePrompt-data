Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2` is true):**
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`) and then buy one additional yogurt at the regular price (`a`).

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2` is false):**
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`).

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program should print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`, which is correct.

- **Example 2: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program should print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`, which is correct.

- **Example 3: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program should print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`, which is correct.

- **Example 4: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program should print `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`, which is correct.

The program correctly handles both even and odd values of `n` and makes the right decision based on the comparison between `2 * a` and `b`.

Correctness: **True**
