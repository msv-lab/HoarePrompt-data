Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, and `_` is 2. If `2 * a < b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `2 * a >= b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.***
