The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, the only state that can be adjusted is the value of `_`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` is now 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input, `b` is the third integer from input, and `_` is 2. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged.**
