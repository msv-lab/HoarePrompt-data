Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 and `n` is odd, `a` is an input integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an input integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, `_` is 0. If `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.***
