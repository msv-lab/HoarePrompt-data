The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input, where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the following rules: If `n` is odd, it prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even, it prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
