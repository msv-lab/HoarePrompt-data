Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, and `_` is 2. If `2 * a < b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `2 * a >= b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.**

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer, `b` is the third integer, and `_` is 2.
- The if condition checks if `2 * a < b`.
- If the condition `2 * a < b` is true, the postcondition of the if part is that the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
- If the condition `2 * a < b` is false, the postcondition of the else part is that the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.
- Therefore, the overall postcondition combines these two cases, ensuring that either `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` holds, depending on the initial values of `a` and `b`.
