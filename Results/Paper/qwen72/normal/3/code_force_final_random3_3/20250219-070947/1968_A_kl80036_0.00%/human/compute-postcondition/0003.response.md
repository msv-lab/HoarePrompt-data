Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `y` is equal to `x // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `x` is an integer input that is greater than 0.
   - `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2. This will result in the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is the integer division of `x` by 2.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2, and x is an input integer greater than 0)**
