The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the input integer `x` (which is used to define the range). The loop can execute again based on the value of `i` and the range defined by `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and the input integer `x` must be such that the range defined by `int(x)` is greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 2, `y` is equal to `x // 2`**
