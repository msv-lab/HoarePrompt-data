The function `func` accepts a parameter `x` where `x` is an integer and 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. The function returns an integer `y` such that 1 ≤ y < x and the value of \gcd(x, y) + y is maximized.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and returns an integer `y` (1 ≤ y < x) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` itself is maximized.**
