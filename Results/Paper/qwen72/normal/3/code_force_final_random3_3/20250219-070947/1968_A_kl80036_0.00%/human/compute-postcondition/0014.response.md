Functionality: ** The function reads an integer from the user, which represents the number of iterations to perform. For each iteration, it reads another integer `x` (where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and calculates `y` as `x // 2`. It then prints `y` for each iteration. After the function concludes, the number of iterations `i` is equal to the user-provided number of iterations, `x` is the last input integer provided (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and `y` is equal to `x // 2` for the last iteration. The function does not return any value. **
