Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1 (though this value is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `y` is equal to `x // 2`, which means `y` is the result of integer division of `x` by 2.

When the `print(y)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `y`, which is the integer division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `y` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2, and x is an input integer greater than 1)**
