You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer x as input where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and it should be called multiple times with different values of x, each time finding an integer y such that 1 ≤ y < x and \gcd(x, y) + y is maximized.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to the user-provided number of iterations (an integer between 2 and 1000), `x` is the last input integer provided (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and `y` is equal to `x // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from the user, which represents the number of iterations to perform. For each iteration, it reads another integer `x` (where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and calculates `y` as `x // 2`. It then prints `y` for each iteration. After the function concludes, the number of iterations `i` is equal to the user-provided number of iterations, `x` is the last input integer provided (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and `y` is equal to `x // 2` for the last iteration. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always find the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). According to the program, \( y = 5 \) is printed. However, the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(10, y) + y \) is \( y = 6 \), because \( \gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \), which is greater than \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \). The program simply divides \( x \) by 2, which does not guarantee the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
