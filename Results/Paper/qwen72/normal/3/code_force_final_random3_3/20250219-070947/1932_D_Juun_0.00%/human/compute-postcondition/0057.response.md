Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `trumps` is an empty list, and `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order, followed by the suit, and separated by a space.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The number of rounds `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`trump`**: The trump suit remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cards`**: The list of cards remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`suits`**: After all iterations, all values in the `suits` dictionary are set to `None` because each suit is reset to `None` after processing a pair.
- **`trumps`**: The `trumps` list is empty because the loop continues to pop elements from it until it is empty.
- **`answers`**: The `answers` list contains strings for each pair of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit. Each string is formed by concatenating the rank of the card from the `suits` dictionary, the suit of the card, the last element of `trumps` (which has been removed from `trumps`), and the trump suit. The loop ensures that each pair of cards is processed and added to `answers` until `trumps` is empty. If `trumps` becomes empty before all pairs are processed, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and terminate.
