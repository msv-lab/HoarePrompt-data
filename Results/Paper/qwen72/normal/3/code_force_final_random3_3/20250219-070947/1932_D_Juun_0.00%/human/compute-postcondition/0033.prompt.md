Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "CDHS", `rank` is the first character of the card string, and `suit` is the second character of the card string. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` and `answers` remains an empty list. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, `trumps` remains an empty list. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` contains one string which is the result of sorting `suits[suit]` and `rank` and then concatenating each with `suit` and joining them with a space. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` remains an empty list and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`. The values for the other keys in `suits` remain `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "CDHS", `card` is the next card string in the list, `cards` must have at least one more unprocessed card string, `rank` is the first character of `card`, and `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `rank` has been appended to the list `trumps`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `suits[suit]` is now `None`, and `answers` is a list that includes an additional string formed by joining the sorted values of the previous `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, followed by `suit`. If `suits[suit]` was `None`, `suits[suit]` is now assigned the value of `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, `card` is the next card string in the list, `rank` is the first character of the next `card`, `suit` is the second character of the next `card`, and `cards` must have at least one more unprocessed card string. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` now includes the `rank` of the next card. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, a new string is appended to `answers` which is the concatenation of `rank` and `suit` in sorted order, separated by a space, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits` is a dictionary with the key `suit` now mapped to the value `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
