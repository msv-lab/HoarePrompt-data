Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a card game scenario where it takes three inputs: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump` (one of "C", "D", "H", or "S"), and a list of 2n unique card strings `cards` (each card string is two characters long, with the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "C", "D", "H", or "S"). The function does not return any value but prints the following: pairs of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, with the ranks sorted and followed by the suit; pairs of trump cards, sorted by rank; and "IMPOSSIBLE" if there are not enough trump cards to form pairs with the remaining cards. After the function concludes, the input parameters `n`, `trump`, and `cards` remain unchanged, and the internal state of the function (variables `trumps`, `answers`, and `suits`) is reset or emptied. **
