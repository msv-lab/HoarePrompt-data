Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is between 1 and 16.
2. `trump` is the input trump suit, which can be one of "C", "D", "H", or "S".
3. `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings.
4. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.
5. `trumps` must contain at least one element.
6. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order, followed by the suit, and separated by a space.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`trumps`**: This list must contain at least one element. Since it is not explicitly defined, we can infer that it contains card ranks (e.g., '2', '3', '4', etc.) that are of the trump suit.
2. **`trump`**: This is a single character representing the trump suit, which can be one of "C", "D", "H", or "S".
3. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list. Since `trumps` contains at least one element, the `pop` method will successfully return a card rank.
4. **`f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`**: This formatted string will concatenate the last two elements of `trumps` with the `trump` suit.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. The first `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the last element of `trumps`. Let's call this rank `rank1`.
2. The second `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the new last element of `trumps` (which was the second-to-last element before the first pop). Let's call this rank `rank2`.
3. The `print` statement will then output the formatted string `f'{rank1}{trump} {rank2}{trump}'`.

### Example:
If `trumps` is `['10', 'J', 'Q', 'K']` and `trump` is 'H', then:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return 'K'.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return 'Q'.
- The `print` statement will output: `K H Q H`.

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `trumps` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `trumps` and the `trump` suit.

Output: **[rank1][trump] [rank2][trump] (where [rank1] and [rank2] are the last two elements of the `trumps` list, and [trump] is the trump suit)**
