To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an integer between 1 and 16.
2. `trump` is a string representing the trump suit, which can be one of "C", "D", "H", or "S".
3. `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings.
4. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.
5. `trumps` must contain at least one element.
6. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order, followed by the suit, and separated by a space.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`trumps` List**: The precondition states that `trumps` must contain at least one element. Since the `print` statement calls `trumps.pop()` twice, `trumps` must contain at least two elements.
2. **`trump` Suit**: The `trump` suit is one of "C", "D", "H", or "S".
3. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list. Since `trumps` contains at least two elements, the first call to `trumps.pop()` will return the last element, and the second call will return the second-to-last element.
4. **Formatted String**: The `print` statement will format the output as follows:
   - The first element popped from `trumps` followed by the `trump` suit.
   - A space.
   - The second element popped from `trumps` followed by the `trump` suit.

### Example:
- Suppose `trumps` is `['10', 'J']` and `trump` is "H".
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return "J".
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return "10".
- The formatted string will be "JH 10H".

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output two elements from the `trumps` list, each followed by the `trump` suit, separated by a space. The exact values of the elements in `trumps` are not specified, but they are known to be unique and part of the `cards` list.

Output: **[trumps_last_element][trump] [trumps_second_to_last_element][trump] (where [trumps_last_element] and [trumps_second_to_last_element] are the last and second-to-last elements of the `trumps` list, respectively, and [trump] is the trump suit)**
