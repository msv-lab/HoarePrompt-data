Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to something other than `None`, `suit` is the next key in `suits` with a non-`None` value, `rank` is the corresponding non-`None` value for the next `suit`, `trumps` is a non-empty list, `answers` is a list that now includes the string formed by concatenating the previous `rank`, `suit`, the last element of `trumps` (which has been removed from `trumps`), and `trump`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**
