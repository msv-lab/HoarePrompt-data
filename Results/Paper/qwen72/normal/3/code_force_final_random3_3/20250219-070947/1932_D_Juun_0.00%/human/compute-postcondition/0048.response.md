Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

The return statement without any value or variable specified simply ends the function execution and returns control to the caller without returning any specific value. The variables `n`, `trump`, `cards`, `suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `trumps`, and `answers` remain unchanged in their states as described in the initial state, but no value or variable is returned by the function.
