The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is 0 or `a + (b + c) // 3` or `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` depending on the conditions `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, or `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, or `(b + c) % 3 == 0` respectively.**
