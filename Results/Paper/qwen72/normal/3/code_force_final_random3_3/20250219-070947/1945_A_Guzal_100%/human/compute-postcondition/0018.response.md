Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `k` was `a + (b + c) // 3`, so after the increment, `k` becomes `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
