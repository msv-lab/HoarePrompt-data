The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `a`, `b`, and `c` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, so it needs to be set to 0 for the loop to begin.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
