The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` are also provided, but they are not used in the `print` statement either. Therefore, the `print` statement will simply output `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1**
