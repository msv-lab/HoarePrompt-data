### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of introverts `a`, extroverts `b`, and universals `c`.

2. **Handling Introverts:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone, so the number of tents required for introverts is `a`.

3. **Handling Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3` (full tents) plus any remaining extroverts that need to be accommodated.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, there will be a remainder of 1 or 2 extroverts. These remaining extroverts need to be paired with universals to form a full tent.

4. **Handling Universals:**
   - Universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in tents with extroverts.
   - If the remainder of `b % 3` plus the number of universals `c` is less than 3, it is impossible to form the required full tent, and the function should print `-1`.

5. **Calculating Total Tents:**
   - The total number of tents required is the sum of tents for introverts and the tents for extroverts, plus any additional tents needed for the remaining extroverts and universals.
   - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, an additional tent is needed to accommodate the remaining participants.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of tents `k` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` correctly checks if it is impossible to form the required full tent for the remaining extroverts.
- The calculation `k += a + (b + c) // 3` correctly accounts for the number of tents needed for introverts and the full tents for extroverts and universals.
- The additional check `if (b + c) % 3 != 0` ensures that an extra tent is added if there are any remaining participants that cannot form a full tent.

### Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 2 3`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 4 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 extrovert and 1 universal left, which cannot form a full tent.
- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 4 2`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals.
- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 extrovert and 1 universal left, which cannot form a full tent.
- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1 3 2`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `19 7 18`
  - Output: `28`
  - Reason: 19 tents for introverts, 2 tents for 6 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals, plus 18 universals in 6 additional tents.
- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: No participants, so no tents are needed.
- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `7 0 0`
  - Output: `7`
  - Reason: 7 tents for 7 introverts.
- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `0 24 0`
  - Output: `8`
  - Reason: 8 tents for 24 extroverts (8 * 3 = 24).
- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Output: `1666666667`
  - Reason: 1000000000 tents for introverts, 333333333 tents for 1000000000 extroverts (333333333 * 3 = 1000000000), and 1000000000 universals in 333333333 additional tents.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
