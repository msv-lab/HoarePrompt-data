Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `k` is 0. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`.***
