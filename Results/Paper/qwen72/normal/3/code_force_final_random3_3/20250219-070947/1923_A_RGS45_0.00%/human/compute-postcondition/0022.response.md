Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the last `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed last `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the last `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The loop counter `_` has reached the value `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The variable `n` holds the last integer input provided by the user, representing the number of cells in the ribbon for the last test case.
- The variable `arr` holds the last string input provided by the user, representing the state of the ribbon for the last test case.
- The variable `x` holds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the last `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found in the last `arr`.
- The variable `y` holds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed last `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found in the reversed last `arr`.
- The variable `z` holds the substring of the last `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`, which is the part of the ribbon containing chips (if any) and the free cells between them.
