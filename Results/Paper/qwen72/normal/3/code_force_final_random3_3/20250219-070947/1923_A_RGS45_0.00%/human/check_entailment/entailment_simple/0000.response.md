### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the ribbon as a string `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first chip.

3. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip. This is done by slicing the string from index `x` to index `n - y`.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0) in the extracted substring `z`. This is the number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The logic correctly identifies the range of the ribbon that contains all the chips.
- By counting the number of free cells (0) in this range, it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that there is at least one chip in each test case, which is consistent with the problem constraints.
- **String Manipulation**: The use of string slicing and counting is efficient and appropriate for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles multiple test cases, identifies the range of the ribbon containing all chips, and counts the number of free cells in this range to determine the minimum number of operations.
