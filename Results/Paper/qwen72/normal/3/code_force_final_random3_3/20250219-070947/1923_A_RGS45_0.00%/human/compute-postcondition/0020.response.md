Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
