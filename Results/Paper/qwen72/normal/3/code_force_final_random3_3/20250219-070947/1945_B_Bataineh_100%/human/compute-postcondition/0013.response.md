Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (i.e., `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`), then `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, either `m` is less than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `m` also remains unchanged.***
