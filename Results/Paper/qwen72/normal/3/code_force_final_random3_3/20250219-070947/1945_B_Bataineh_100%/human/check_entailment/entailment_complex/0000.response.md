### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the user.

2. **Logic for Calculating Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks:**
   - The function checks the relationship between `m`, `a`, and `b` to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it means that no two fireworks from different installations will overlap, so the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is 2.
   - If `m` is less than one of the frequencies but greater than the other, it calculates the number of additional fireworks that can be seen from the installation with the higher frequency by using integer division `m // b` or `m // a`.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, it calculates the total number of fireworks that can be seen from both installations by using integer division `m // a` and `m // b`, and adds 2 to account for the initial fireworks from both installations.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal and `m` is very large correctly by printing `2 + m // a + m // b`.
   - The function also handles the case where `a` and `b` are both 1 and `m` is very large, which results in `2 + m + m`.

5. **Mathematical Correctness:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is mathematically sound. The integer division `m // a` and `m // b` correctly counts the number of additional fireworks that can be seen from each installation within the visibility window `m`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all the given test cases and edge cases. The logic is sound and the output matches the expected results based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
