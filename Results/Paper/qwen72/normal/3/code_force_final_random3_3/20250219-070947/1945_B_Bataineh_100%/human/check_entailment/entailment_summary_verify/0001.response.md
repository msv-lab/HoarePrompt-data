### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the launch frequencies of the two installations and the visibility duration of the fireworks, respectively.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - The conditions are based on the relationship between `m` and the launch frequencies `a` and `b`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `m < a` and `m < b`**
     - If the visibility duration `m` is less than both launch frequencies `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2. This is because no two fireworks from the same installation can overlap, and the only overlap possible is between one firework from each installation.
     - **Example 1:**
       - Input: `6 7 4`
       - Output: `2`
       - Reason: `m < a` and `m < b`, so the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2.
   - **Case 2: `m < a` and `m > b`**
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `2 + m // b`. This is because the first installation can only launch one firework within `m` minutes, but the second installation can launch multiple fireworks, each of which will be visible for `m + 1` minutes.
     - **Example 2:**
       - Input: `3 4 10`
       - Output: `7`
       - Reason: `m > a` and `m > b`, so the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7`.
   - **Case 3: `m < b` and `m > a`**
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `2 + m // a`. This is similar to the previous case but with the roles of `a` and `b` reversed.
     - **Example 3:**
       - Input: `7 8 56`
       - Output: `17`
       - Reason: `m > a` and `m > b`, so the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `56 // 7 + 56 // 8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17`.
   - **Case 4: `m >= a` and `m >= b`**
     - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is because both installations can launch multiple fireworks within `m` minutes, and each firework will be visible for `m + 1` minutes.
     - **Example 4:**
       - Input: `5 6 78123459896`
       - Output: `28645268630`
       - Reason: `m > a` and `m > b`, so the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630`.
     - **Example 5:**
       - Input: `1 1 1`
       - Output: `4`
       - Reason: `m >= a` and `m >= b`, so the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.
     - **Example 6:**
       - Input: `1 1 1000000000000000000`
       - Output: `2000000000000000002`
       - Reason: `m >= a` and `m >= b`, so the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `1000000000000000000 // 1 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

### Verification with Examples:
- The provided examples and their outputs are consistent with the logic described in the program.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are equal to 1, and it also handles large values of `m` without issues.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
