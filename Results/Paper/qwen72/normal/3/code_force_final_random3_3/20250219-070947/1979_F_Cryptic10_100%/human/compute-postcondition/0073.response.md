The loop head involves the variables `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops` being iterated in reverse. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses and what conditions must be met for it to continue.

1. **`ops`**: The loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order. At the end of the previous iteration, `ops` still contains at least two tuples. For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple (since the loop has already processed one tuple in the previous iteration).

2. **`v1` and `v2`**: These variables are set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, they will be set to the values of the next tuple in the reversed list, which is the last tuple in the original list.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ops` still contains at least one tuple.
- `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the last tuple in `ops`.

State: **`ops` still contains at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the last tuple in `ops`**.
