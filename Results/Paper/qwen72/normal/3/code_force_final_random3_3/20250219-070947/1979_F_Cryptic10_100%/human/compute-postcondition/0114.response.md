Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `p1` contains the elements of `vx` and all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the time of the tuple's processing.
- `p2` contains all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the time of the tuple's processing.
- `ops` is an empty list.
- `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`ops` is an empty list**: Since `ops` is empty, no tuples are processed. Therefore, no elements are added to `p1` or `p2` based on the conditions described in the initial state.
2. **`vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left**: This means `vx` can contain 0, 1, or 2 elements.
3. **`p1` contains the elements of `vx`**: Since `ops` is empty, `p1` will only contain the elements of `vx`.
4. **`p2` is empty**: Since `ops` is empty, `p2` will be an empty list.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
- `p1[::-1]` will reverse the list `p1`.
- `p1[::-1] + p2` will concatenate the reversed `p1` with `p2`.
- `map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)` will convert each element in the concatenated list to a string.
- `' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))` will join these string elements with a space.
- The final `print` statement will format the string and print it.

### Possible Values:
- If `vx` is empty, `p1` will be empty, and the output will be an empty string.
- If `vx` contains one element, `p1` will contain that one element, and the output will be that element.
- If `vx` contains two elements, `p1` will contain those two elements, and the output will be those two elements in reverse order.

### Final Output:
Since `p2` is always empty, the output will only depend on the elements of `p1`, which are the elements of `vx` in reverse order.

Output: **! [elements of vx in reverse order] (where vx is a set with at most 2 elements)**

If `vx` is empty:
Output: **!**

If `vx` contains one element, say `x`:
Output: **! x**

If `vx` contains two elements, say `x` and `y`:
Output: **! y x**
