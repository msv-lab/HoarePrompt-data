Postcondition: ***`ops` is either empty or contains tuples based on the value of `v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it. `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) minus `v1` and, if applicable, `v3`. `v1` is the first value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is the second value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)` and `_` is the second value returned by `q(0)` but is not used.***
