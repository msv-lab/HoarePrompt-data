Output State: **`ops` is empty, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, and `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The list `ops` is now empty because the loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order and removes elements as it processes them.
- The list `p1` contains the remaining elements of the original set `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it when the condition `p1[-1] != v2` was true.
- The list `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it when the condition `p1[-1] == v2` was true.
