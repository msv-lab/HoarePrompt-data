Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` and `v2` will be assigned from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and `p1` has been updated to include `v1` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` has been updated to include `v1`.**

In natural language, the initial state remains the same with the following changes:
- If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- The values of `vx`, `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
