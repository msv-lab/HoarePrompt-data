Output State: **`ops` still contains at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the last tuple in `ops`, `p1` or `p2` has been updated by appending `v1` to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p2`. Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`. The values of `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged, but one of the lists, `p1` or `p2`, is updated by having `v1` appended to it.
