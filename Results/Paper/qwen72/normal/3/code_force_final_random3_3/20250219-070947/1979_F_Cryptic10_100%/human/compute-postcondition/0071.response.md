The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`. The loop iterates over the list `ops` in reverse order, so the state of `ops` and the values of `v1` and `v2` need to be considered for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
- `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the last tuple in `ops`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `ops` must contain at least two tuples, and `v1` and `v2` will be set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops` (since the loop is iterating in reverse).

State: **`ops` must contain at least two tuples, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`**
