Initial State: `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`

Now, let's analyze the code snippet:

```
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

1. **Identify the variables and their values:**
   - `ops` is a list of tuples, and it must contain at least two tuples.
   - `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.

2. **Understand the code:**
   - The code checks if the last element of `p1` (which is a list) is equal to `v2`.
   - If it is, `p2` (another list) is chosen; otherwise, `p1` is chosen.
   - The chosen list is then appended with `v1`.

3. **Determine the impact on the variables:**
   - `v1` and `v2` are not changed by this code.
   - The list `p1` or `p2` is modified based on the condition.

4. **Calculate the result:**
   - If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2.append(v1)`.
   - If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1.append(v1)`.

5. **Output State:**
   - `ops` still contains at least two tuples.
   - `v1` and `v2` are still set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.
   - If `p1[-1] == v2`, `p2` is appended with `v1`.
   - If `p1[-1] != v2`, `p1` is appended with `v1`.

Output State: **`ops` contains at least two tuples, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`. If `p1[-1] == v2`, `p2` is appended with `v1`. Otherwise, `p1` is appended with `v1`.**
