Output State: **`ops` now contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` in addition to any existing tuples, `v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, `v3` is updated to the first value returned by `q` when called with the argument 0, `v3` is removed from `vx`, `len(vx)` is now `len(vx) - 1` and must be greater than 2, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
