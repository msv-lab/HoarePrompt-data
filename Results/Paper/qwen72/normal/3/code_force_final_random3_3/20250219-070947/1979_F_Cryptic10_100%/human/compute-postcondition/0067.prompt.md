Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, the loop will execute one more time if the original input was greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1`. `ops` is a list. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `v2` is greater than 0. If `v2` ≤ 0, `vx` also excludes `v3`, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. `v1` and `v2` are the first and second values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 1`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1`, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `v2` is greater than 0. If `v2` ≤ 0, `vx` also excludes `v3`, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument 0, and the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are appended to `ops`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1` and `v3` if `v2` ≤ 0. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the new tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` in addition to any existing tuples, and `v3` is updated to the first value returned by `q` when called with the argument 0. `v3` is removed from `vx`, `len(vx)` is now `len(vx) - 1` and must be greater than 2, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
