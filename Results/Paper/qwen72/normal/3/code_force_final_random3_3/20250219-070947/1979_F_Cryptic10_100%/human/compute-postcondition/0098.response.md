Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values from the tuple `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `vx` contains at least 3 elements, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, and `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` <= 0, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`.**
