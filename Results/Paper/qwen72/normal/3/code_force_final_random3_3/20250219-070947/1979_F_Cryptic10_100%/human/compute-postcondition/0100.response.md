The code `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`.

- `v1` has already been removed from `vx`.
- `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.
- `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it.
- `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.
- If `v2` > 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`.
- If `v2` <= 0, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`.

After appending `(v1, v2)` to `ops`:

- If `v2` > 0, `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` in addition to any existing tuples.
- If `v2` <= 0, `ops` now includes the tuples `(v3, 0)`, `(v1, 0)`, and `(v1, v2)`.

The states of `p1` and `p2` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but `ops` is updated.

Output State: **`v1` has been removed from `vx`, `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` in addition to any existing tuples. If `v2` <= 0, `v3` has been removed from `vx` and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` as well.**
