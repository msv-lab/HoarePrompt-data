To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `v1` and `v2` from the tuples in `ops`.

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops`. For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
2. **State Adjustments**: The state before the loop starts indicates that `ops` contains tuples of the form `(v1, v2)`, `(v3, 0)`, or `(v1, 0)`. However, the loop will only execute if `ops` is not empty.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `vx` has been reduced to 2 or fewer elements.
- `ops` contains the tuples as described.
- `p1` is a list containing the remaining elements of `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. The first iteration of the loop will set `v1` and `v2` to the values of the last tuple in `ops`.

State: **`ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the last tuple in `ops`**
