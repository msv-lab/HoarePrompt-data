Output State: **`v1` has been removed from `vx`, `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. `v3` is now 0, and `v3` is no longer in `vx`. `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` in addition to any previous tuples.**
