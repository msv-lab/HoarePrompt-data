Output State: **`ops` contains a series of tuples, each representing the operations performed during each iteration of the loop. `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it. `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left, as the loop continues until `len(vx) <= 2`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `ops` list will have accumulated all the tuples generated during the loop's execution. Each tuple represents the values of `v1` and `v2` (or `v3` and `v1` if `v2` was less than or equal to 0) that were processed in each iteration.
- The `p1` list will contain the remaining elements of `vx` after the loop has finished, plus any elements from `ops` that were appended to it.
- The `p2` list will contain elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.
- The `vx` set will have at most 2 elements left, as the loop continues to remove elements from `vx` until its length is 2 or less.
