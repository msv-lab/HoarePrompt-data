Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The set `vx` will contain exactly 2 integers, as the loop continues to reduce the size of `vx` until it has only 2 elements left.
- The list `ops` will be empty, as all the tuples in `ops` are processed and appended to either `p1` or `p2` during the loop's execution.
- The list `p1` will contain the two integers from `vx` and any `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2` at the time of the tuple's processing.
- The list `p2` will contain any `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2` at the time of the tuple's processing.
