Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer minus 4, and `t` must be greater than -1.
2. `n` is a new input integer greater than 1.
3. `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
4. `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
5. `i` is set to `n`.
6. `n` must be greater than `mdx`.
7. `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mdx`**:
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2.
   - `n % 2` is the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2 - 1`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2`.

2. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` counts the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
   - This means it counts how many times the value at `a[mdx]` appears in the sublist `a[mdx:n]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some values to understand the calculation better:
- Suppose `n = 5` (an odd number).
  - `mdx = 5 // 2 + 5 % 2 - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2`.
  - `a` is a sorted list, say `a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.
  - The sublist `a[mdx:n]` is `a[2:5] = [3, 3, 3]`.
  - `a[mdx]` is `3`.
  - `res` is the number of elements in `[3, 3, 3]` that are equal to `3`, which is 3.

- Suppose `n = 6` (an even number).
  - `mdx = 6 // 2 + 6 % 2 - 1 = 3 + 0 - 1 = 2`.
  - `a` is a sorted list, say `a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`.
  - The sublist `a[mdx:n]` is `a[2:6] = [3, 3, 3, 4]`.
  - `a[mdx]` is `3`.
  - `res` is the number of elements in `[3, 3, 3, 4]` that are equal to `3`, which is 3.

### General Case:
- For any `n` greater than 1, `mdx` will be the middle index of the list `a` (or the index just before the middle if `n` is even).
- `res` will count the number of elements from `a[mdx]` to `a[n-1]` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the number of elements in the sublist `a[mdx:n]` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of elements in the sublist `a[mdx:n]` that are equal to `a[mdx]`)**
