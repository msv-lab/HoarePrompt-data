Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the median needs to be increased. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of operations is flawed. The program incorrectly increments the result (`res`) for every element that is equal to the median, but it should instead calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median to the next higher value in the sorted array.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the median is `3`. To increase the median, we need to increase the value at index `2` (the median position) to at least `4`. The correct number of operations is `1` (increment the median value `3` to `4`). However, the program will output `3` because it incorrectly counts all elements equal to the median.

Another example:
```
1
4
1 2 3 3
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, and the median is `2.5` (the average of `2` and `3`). To increase the median, we need to increase the value at index `1` (the first median position) to at least `4`. The correct number of operations is `2` (increment `2` to `4` and `3` to `4`). However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly counts all elements equal to the median.

These examples show that the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
