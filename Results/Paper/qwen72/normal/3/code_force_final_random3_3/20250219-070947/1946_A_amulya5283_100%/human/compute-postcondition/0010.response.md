Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is not equal to 1, `res` is 0, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**

The value of `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, where `n` is an input integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
