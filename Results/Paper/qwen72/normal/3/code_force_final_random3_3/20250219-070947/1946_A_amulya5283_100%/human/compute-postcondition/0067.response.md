The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case.**
