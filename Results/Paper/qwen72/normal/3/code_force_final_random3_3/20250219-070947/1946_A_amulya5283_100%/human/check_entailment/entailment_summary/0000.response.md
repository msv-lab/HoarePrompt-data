Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Median Calculation**: The median is correctly identified as the element at the index `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` after sorting the array. This is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array.
2. **Operation Counting**: The program counts the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median value. This is incorrect because it does not account for the actual operations needed to increase the median. The correct approach should be to find the smallest number greater than the current median and calculate the number of operations required to make the median equal to this number.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where `n` is 1 by printing 1, which is correct because the only way to increase the median of a single-element array is to increase that element by 1.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the current median.
- Find the smallest element greater than the current median.
- Calculate the number of operations required to make the median equal to this smallest element.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Correctness: **False**
