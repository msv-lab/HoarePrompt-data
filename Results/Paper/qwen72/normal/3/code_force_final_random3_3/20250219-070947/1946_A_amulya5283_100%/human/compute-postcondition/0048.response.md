Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, and if `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is preserved for `t` and `n`.
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates `a` to be a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- The conditions for `mdx`, `i`, and `res` remain the same as described in the initial state, but now `a` has been updated to the new input list.
