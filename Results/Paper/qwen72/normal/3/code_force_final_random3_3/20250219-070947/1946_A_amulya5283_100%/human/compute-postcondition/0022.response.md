Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer minus 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is not directly used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`, and it is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula essentially finds the middle index of the list `a`:
     - If `n` is odd, `mdx` will be the index of the middle element.
     - If `n` is even, `mdx` will be the index of the element just before the middle.
   - `i` is set to `n - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

3. **Calculating `res`:**
   - `a[mdx]` is the element at the middle index of the sorted list `a`.
   - The range from `mdx` to `n - 1` includes all elements from the middle index to the end of the list.
   - `res` will count how many elements in this range are equal to `a[mdx]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the number of elements from the middle index to the end of the list that are equal to the middle element.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the count of elements from the middle index to the end of the list that are equal to the middle element.

Output: **res (where res is the number of elements in the sorted list `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`)**
