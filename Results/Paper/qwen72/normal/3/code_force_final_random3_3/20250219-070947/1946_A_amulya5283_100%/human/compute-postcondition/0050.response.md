Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer minus 4, and `t` must be greater than -1.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - The value `1` is a constant integer and will be printed as is.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(1)` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `i`, or `res`.

Output: **1**
