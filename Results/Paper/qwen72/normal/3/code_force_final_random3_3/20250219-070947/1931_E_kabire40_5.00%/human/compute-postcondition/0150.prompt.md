Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the string representations of the integer values of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed strings of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`. `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, and `x` is the length of `rev_val` minus 1. If `10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the integer values of all even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed string representation of all odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string. `x` is the length of `rev_val` minus 1. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the condition is false and the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the last string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together, plus the string representations of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed values of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string. If `10




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
