Output: **Anna**

Explanation:
- The `print('Anna')` statement simply prints the string 'Anna'.
- The initial state describes several variables and objects (`y`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `rev_res`, `rev_val`, `x`) but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output is exactly what is specified in the `print` statement, which is the string 'Anna'.
