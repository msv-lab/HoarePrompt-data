Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string and must have at least 2 elements, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, `x` is 2, `val_in` is the integer value of the third element in `rev_val`.**

Explanation:
- The code `val_in = int(rev_val[x])` assigns the integer value of the third element in `rev_val` (since `x` is 2) to `val_in`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
