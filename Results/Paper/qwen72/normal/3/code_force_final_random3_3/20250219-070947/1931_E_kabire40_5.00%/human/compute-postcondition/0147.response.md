Postcondition: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the last string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together, plus the string representations of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed values of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string, and `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`**
