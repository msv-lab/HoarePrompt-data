The function `func` is described with certain parameter constraints but lacks explicit parameters in its definition. Based on the provided constraints, the function likely accepts multiple inputs, including an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of a list, an integer `m` with no specific role mentioned in the output, and a list `a` of integers. However, the function's output is not clearly defined in the provided information. To accurately describe the functionality, we need to infer the most plausible output based on the given constraints.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The function `func` likely processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n` and `a`, and possibly `m`. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided. A common pattern in such functions is to return a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of integers, and possibly an integer `m`. For each test case, it processes the list `a` and returns a result. The function is designed to handle up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 2 × 10^5.**
