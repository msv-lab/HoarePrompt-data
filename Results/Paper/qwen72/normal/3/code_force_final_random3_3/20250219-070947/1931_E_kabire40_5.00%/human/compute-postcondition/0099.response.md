Postcondition: ***`y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the integer values of all even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed string representation of all odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string. `x` is the length of `rev_val` minus 1. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the condition is false and the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`.***
