Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- The precondition that `x` must be at least 1 is no longer explicitly stated, as `x` now holds the value of the first input integer, which could be any integer.
