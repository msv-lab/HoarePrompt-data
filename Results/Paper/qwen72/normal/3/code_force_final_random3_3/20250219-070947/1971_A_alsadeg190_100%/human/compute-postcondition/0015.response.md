Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` must be greater than 2.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y`.

Since `x` is an input integer and it is specified that `x` must be greater than 2, we can say that `x` will be some integer greater than 2. The value of `y` is not constrained by any conditions, so it can be any integer.

Output: **x, y (where x is an integer greater than 2 and y is an integer)**
