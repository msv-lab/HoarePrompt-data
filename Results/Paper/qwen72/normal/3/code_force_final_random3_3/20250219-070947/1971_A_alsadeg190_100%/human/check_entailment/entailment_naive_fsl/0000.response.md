Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the given problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The program works correctly for all potential cases, including when `x` and `y` are equal, and when `x` is either greater than or less than `y`. The constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) and the input format are also correctly handled. Therefore, the program is correct.
