Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` must be greater than 2.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x` in that order. Since `x` is explicitly stated to be greater than 2, and `y` is an input integer with no specific constraints, the output will be:

Output: **y, x (where y is the value of the input integer y and x is an input integer greater than 2)**
