Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, reading two integers `x` and `y` for each test case.

2. **Comparison and Output**:
   - For each pair of integers `(x, y)`, the program checks if `x` is less than `y`.
   - If `x < y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x >= y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

This logic ensures that the minimum of `x` and `y` is always printed first, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`, which is exactly what the problem requires.

The program also handles the input and output format correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
- For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers.
- It prints the results in the required format for each test case.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9), the program will work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
