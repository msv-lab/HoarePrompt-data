Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for a given \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints specific pairs of coordinates for each test case based on the value of \(n\).

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program prints (1, 1) and (1, 2).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has 2 elements. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has 4 elements. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

3. **For \(n > 3\)**:
   - The program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and then (j, j) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) includes the distances from (1, 1) to (1, 2), (1, 1) to (2, 4), (1, 2) to (2, 4), and the distances from (j, j) to all other points.
   - The distances from (1, 1) to (1, 2) and (1, 2) to (2, 4) are 1 and 4, respectively.
   - The distances from (1, 1) to (2, 4) and (1, 2) to (2, 4) are 4 and 3, respectively.
   - The distances from (j, j) to (1, 1) and (1, 2) are \(j-1\) and \(j-1+1 = j\), respectively.
   - The distances from (j, j) to (2, 4) are \(|j-2| + |j-4| = 2j - 6\).
   - The distances from (j, j) to (k, k) for \(4 \leq j < k \leq n\) are \(|j-k| + |j-k| = 2|j-k|\).

The program ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains a variety of distances, including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and \(2j - 6\) for \(4 \leq j \leq n\). However, the program does not cover all possible distances for \(n > 3\), especially the distances between (j, j) and (1, 1) or (1, 2) for \(j > 4\).

For example, for \(n = 4\), the program prints:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 4)
- (4, 4)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) includes:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\)
- \(|1-2| + |4-1| = 4\)
- \(|1-2| + |4-2| = 3\)
- \(|4-1| + |4-1| = 6\)
- \(|4-1| + |4-2| = 5\)
- \(|4-2| + |4-4| = 2\)

This set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) has 7 elements, which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\).

However, for \(n = 5\), the program prints:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 4)
- (4, 4)
- (5, 5)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) includes:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\)
- \(|1-2| + |4-1| = 4\)
- \(|1-2| + |4-2| = 3\)
- \(|4-1| + |4-1| = 6\)
- \(|4-1| + |4-2| = 5\)
- \(|4-2| + |4-4| = 2\)
- \(|5-1| + |5-1| = 8\)
- \(|5-1| + |5-2| = 7\)
- \(|5-2| + |5-4| = 4\)
- \(|5-4| + |5-4| = 2\)

This set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\) has 9 elements, which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\).

For \(n = 6\), the program prints:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 4)
- (4, 4)
- (5, 5)
- (6, 6)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) includes:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\)
- \(|1-2| + |4-1| = 4\)
- \(|1-2| + |4-2| = 3\)
- \(|4-1| + |4-1| = 6\)
- \(|4-1| + |4-2| = 5\)
- \(|4-2| + |4-4| = 2\)
- \(|5-1| + |5-1| = 8\)
- \(|5-1| + |5-2| = 7\)
- \(|5-2| + |5-4| = 4\)
- \(|5-4| + |5-4| = 2\)
- \(|6-1| + |6-1| = 10\)
- \(|6-1| + |6-2| = 9\)
- \(|6-2| + |6-4| = 6\)
- \(|6-4| + |6-4| = 4\)
- \(|6-5| + |6-5| = 2\)

This set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\) has 11 elements, which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 6\).

The program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given \(n\) values.
