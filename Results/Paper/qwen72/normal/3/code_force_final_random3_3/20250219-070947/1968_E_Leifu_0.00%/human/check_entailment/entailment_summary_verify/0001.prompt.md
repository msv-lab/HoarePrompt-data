You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, and for each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 10^3. For each test case, it prints the pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), and if `n` is 3, it prints (2, 3). If `n` is greater than 3, it prints (2, 4) followed by pairs (j, j) for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` inclusive. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding output has been printed for each `n` input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints a set of \( n \) points.
   - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) for every test case.
   - If \( n = 3 \), it prints the point \((2, 3)\).
   - If \( n > 3 \), it prints the point \((2, 4)\) and then prints points \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Program for Different \( n \):**
   - **For \( n = 2 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct and maximized for \( n = 2 \).

   - **For \( n = 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct and maximized for \( n = 3 \).

   - **For \( n > 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).
     - Let's evaluate the set of distinct Manhattan distances:
       - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is 1.
       - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\) is \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
       - The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\) is \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3 \).
       - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( j \geq 4 \) is \( |1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1) \).
       - The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( j \geq 4 \) is \( |1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1 \).
       - The distance between \((2, 4)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( j \geq 4 \) is \( |2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-2) - 2 \).
       - The distance between any two points \((j, j)\) and \((k, k)\) for \( j, k \geq 4 \) is \( |j-k| + |j-k| = 2|j-k| \).

   - **Checking the Distances:**
     - The distances \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, \ldots, 2(n-1) \) are all distinct and cover a wide range.
     - However, the program does not ensure that all possible distances from 0 to \( 2(n-1) \) are covered, which is necessary to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \( n > 3 \). For example, for \( n = 4 \), the program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\), which results in the distances \(\{0, 1, 3, 4, 6\}\). The distance 2 is missing, and the set of distances is not maximized.
