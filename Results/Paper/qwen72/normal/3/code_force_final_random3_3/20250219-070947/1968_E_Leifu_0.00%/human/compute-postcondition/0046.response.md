The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraint provided, it is implied that the function might use an input `n` which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine what the function returns. However, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation or computation based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function implicitly uses an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, but the specific return value or output is not provided.**
