Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 4')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified in the code snippet.
   - `t` is greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.
   - `j` is only set if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, but its value is not used in the `print` statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('2 4')`.
   - This statement prints the string `'2 4'` directly, regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, `i`, or `j`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'2 4'` because it is a literal string and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

Output: **2 4**
