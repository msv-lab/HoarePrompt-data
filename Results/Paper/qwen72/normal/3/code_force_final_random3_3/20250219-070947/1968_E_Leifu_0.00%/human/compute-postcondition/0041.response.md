The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 4 to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, and `j` is 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 6. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6 (since `j` must be less than `n + 1`).

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**
