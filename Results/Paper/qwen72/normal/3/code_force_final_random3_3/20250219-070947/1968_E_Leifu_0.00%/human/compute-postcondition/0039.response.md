The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `j` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is now 5. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5**
