The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.**
