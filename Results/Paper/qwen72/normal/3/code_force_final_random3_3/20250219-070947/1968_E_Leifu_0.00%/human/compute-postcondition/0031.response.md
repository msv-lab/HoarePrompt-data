The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`.**
