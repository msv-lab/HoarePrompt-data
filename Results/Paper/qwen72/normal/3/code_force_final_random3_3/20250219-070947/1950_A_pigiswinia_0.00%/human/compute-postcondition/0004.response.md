The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'STAIRS'. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string 'STAIRS'.

Output: **STAIRS**
