The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.**
