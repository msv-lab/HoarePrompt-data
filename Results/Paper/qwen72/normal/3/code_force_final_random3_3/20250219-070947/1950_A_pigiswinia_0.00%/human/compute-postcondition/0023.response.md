The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state describes the conditions under which the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are evaluated, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is not conditional and always prints the same string.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
   - If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds.
   - If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds.
   - Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('NONE')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is not dependent on any of the conditions or variables described in the initial state.
   - It simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **NONE**
