You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three integers a, b, and c as input, where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers. For each iteration from 0 to `t-1`, if `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds and 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds and 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds and 'NONE' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9) from the input. It then prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After `t` iterations, the function completes, and the program state is such that `t` iterations have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each set of inputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" when the digits form a stair. The problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (without the 'S') if the digits form a stair. This discrepancy means the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

For example, for the input:
```
1
1 2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
STAIR
```
But the program will output:
```
STAIRS
```
This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected.
