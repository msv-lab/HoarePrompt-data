Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive. `t` is now an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIRS')
    elif a < b > c:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold, and it is also not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
