The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes several conditions:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
  - `i` is 0.
  - `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
  - `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

- However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
