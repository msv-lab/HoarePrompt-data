Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
   - If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds.
   - Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold, and it is also not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('NONE')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string 'NONE'.
   - The initial state provides conditions for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
   - The `print` statement will execute regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string 'NONE' because it is not dependent on any of the conditions or variables described in the initial state.

Output: **NONE**
