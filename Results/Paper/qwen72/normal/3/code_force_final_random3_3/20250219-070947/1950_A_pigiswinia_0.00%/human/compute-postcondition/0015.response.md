Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- The condition `a < b < c` holds if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
- If the condition `a < b < c` does not hold, it is also not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `a < b < c`**:
   - If `a < b < c` holds, it means that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
   - If `a < b < c` does not hold, it means that either `a` is not less than `b`, or `b` is not less than `c`, or both.

2. **Additional Condition**:
   - If `a < b < c` does not hold, it is also not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.
   - This implies that if `a < b < c` is false, then `a < b` and `b > c` cannot both be true at the same time.

### Conclusion:
- The code snippet `print('PEAK')` does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the conditions or values of the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **PEAK**
