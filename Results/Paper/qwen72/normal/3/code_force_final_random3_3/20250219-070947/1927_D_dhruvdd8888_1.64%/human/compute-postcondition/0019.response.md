The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `N`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. `N` must still be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, num)`, otherwise `arr` is an empty list.**
