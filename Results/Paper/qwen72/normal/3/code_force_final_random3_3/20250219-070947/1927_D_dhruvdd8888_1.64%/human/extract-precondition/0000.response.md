Precondition: **The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array a of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) where each element a_i is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and q queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
