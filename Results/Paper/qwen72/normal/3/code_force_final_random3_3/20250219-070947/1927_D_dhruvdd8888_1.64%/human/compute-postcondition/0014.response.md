The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `N`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`.
- `arr` is an empty list if `nums[i]` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 0, num)`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `N` must still be greater than or equal to 0, and `i` must be less than `N + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, and `arr` is an empty list if `nums[i]` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 0, num)`**.
