Postcondition: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is `-1`, `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`, `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` and `r` are input integers, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `ppp` is 23 if `tc` is greater than 5, and `s` is less than or equal to `l`. Additionally, `e` is less than `r`.**
