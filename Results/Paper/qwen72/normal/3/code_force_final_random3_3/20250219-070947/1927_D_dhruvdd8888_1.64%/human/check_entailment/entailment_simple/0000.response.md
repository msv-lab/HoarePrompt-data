Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding two indices \( i \) and \( j \) within a given range \( [l, r] \) such that \( a_i \ne a_j \). Let's break down the program and analyze its correctness step by step.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( N \), the array \( nums \), and the number of queries \( q \).

2. **Segment Identification:**
   - The program appends \(-1\) to the end of the array \( nums \) to handle edge cases.
   - It then iterates through the array to identify segments of consecutive identical numbers and stores these segments in the list \( arr \) as tuples of the form \((\text{start index}, \text{end index}, \text{value})\).

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index \( eli \) in \( arr \) where the segment starts at or after \( l \).
   - It then extracts the start and end indices of the segment from \( arr \).
   - The program checks various conditions to determine if there are two different elements within the range \( [l, r] \):
     - If \( s > l \) and \( s \ne 1 \), it prints \( s - 1 \) and \( s \) (indicating the boundary of the segment).
     - If \( e \ge r \), it prints \(-1, -1\) (indicating no different elements within the range).
     - If \( e < N \), it prints \( s \) and \( e + 1 \) (indicating the boundary of the segment).
     - Otherwise, it prints \(-1, -1\).

4. **Edge Cases and Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( l \) and \( r \) are the same by ensuring \( l < r \).
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the segment that starts at or after \( l \).

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The condition `if tc > 5:` is used to skip detailed print statements for large test cases. This is not a functional issue but rather a debugging aid.
   - The program does not handle the case where \( l \) and \( r \) are within the same segment of identical numbers but \( l \) and \( r \) are not the same. This can be a potential issue.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers.
   - It correctly uses `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment.
   - However, the logic for determining if there are different elements within the range \( [l, r] \) is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for printing \(-1, -1\) and the indices \( s \) and \( e \) need to be more robust to handle all cases.

Given the potential issues in the logic for handling queries, the program is not fully correct. It may fail to find different elements within the range \( [l, r] \) in certain cases.

Correctness: **False**
