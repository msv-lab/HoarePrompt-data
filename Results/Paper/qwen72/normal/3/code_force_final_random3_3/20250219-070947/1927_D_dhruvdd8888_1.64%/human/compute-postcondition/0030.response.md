Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is `-1`, `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`, `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` and `r` are input integers.**

The code snippet `l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` assigns the values of two input integers to the variables `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial state. The values of `l` and `r` are now the integers provided by the user input.
