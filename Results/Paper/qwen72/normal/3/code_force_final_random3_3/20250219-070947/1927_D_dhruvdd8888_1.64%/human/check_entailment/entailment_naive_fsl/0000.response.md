Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

### Actual Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

### Analysis:
- For the query `(1, 5)`, the program correctly outputs `2 3` because there is a pair of different elements within the range `[1, 5]`.
- For the query `(1, 2)`, the program correctly outputs `-1 -1` because all elements in the range `[1, 2]` are the same.
- For the query `(1, 3)`, the program incorrectly outputs `-1 -1` when it should output `1 3` because there is a pair of different elements within the range `[1, 3]`.

The issue arises from the logic used to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j`. The program uses a list `arr` to store ranges of consecutive equal elements and then tries to find a valid pair of indices based on these ranges. However, the logic for determining whether a valid pair exists within the query range is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the query range includes elements from different ranges stored in `arr`.
