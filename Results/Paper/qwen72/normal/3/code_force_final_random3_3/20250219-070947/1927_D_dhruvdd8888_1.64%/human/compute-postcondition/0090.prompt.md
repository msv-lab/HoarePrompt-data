Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is `-1`, `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`, `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1. If `ppp` is 23, the postcondition remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is `-1`, `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`, `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` and `r` are input integers, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `ppp` is 23 if `tc` is greater than 5. If `s` is greater than `l`, then `s` is greater than `l` and if `s` is 1, the current value of `s` is 1, otherwise, `s` is greater than 1. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and if `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. If `e` is less than `r` and `e` is less than `N`, then `e` is less than `r`. If `e` is less than `r` and `e` is not less than `N`, then `e` is not less than `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is `-1`, `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`, `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` and `r` are input integers, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `_` is the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` is greater than `l`, the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` are derived from the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` is not greater than `l` and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `s` is not greater than `l` and `e` is less than `r` and `e` is less than `N`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `s` is not greater than `l` and `e` is less than `r` and `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, the postcondition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is `-1`, `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`, `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` and `r` are the input integers, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is ignored. The state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `s` is greater than `l` or `e` is less than `r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
