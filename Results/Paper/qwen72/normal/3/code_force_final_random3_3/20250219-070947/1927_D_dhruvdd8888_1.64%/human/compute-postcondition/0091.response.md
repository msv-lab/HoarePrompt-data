The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of `n` integers, where each element `a_i` is an integer, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function returns the result of each query, which is based on the elements of the array `a` between the indices `l` and `r`. If the sum of elements between `l` and `r` is even, the function returns "even"; otherwise, it returns "odd". The function also handles the constraints that the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each including an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function returns "even" if the sum of elements in the array `a` between indices `l` and `r` is even, and "odd" otherwise.**
