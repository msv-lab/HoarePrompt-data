Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, num)`, otherwise `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[1]` to the variable `num`.
- Initially, `num` was the first integer in the list `nums`, which is `nums[0]`.
- After the assignment, `num` now holds the value of `nums[1]`.
- The condition `if nums[i] is not equal to num` is checked, but since `i` is 1, this condition is always false (because `nums[1]` is equal to `num` after the assignment).
- Therefore, `arr` remains an empty list.
- All other variables (`N`, `i`, `nums`, `s`, `e`) remain unchanged.
