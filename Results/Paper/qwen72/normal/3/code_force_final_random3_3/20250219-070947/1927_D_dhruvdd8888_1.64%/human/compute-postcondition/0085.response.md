Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. `i` is `N`.
3. `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
4. `num` is `-1`.
5. `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
6. `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
8. `l` and `r` are input integers.
9. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
10. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
11. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
12. The third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is ignored.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`nums` List Construction**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, and `-1` is appended to the end.
   - For example, if the input is `1 2 2 3 3 3`, then `nums` will be `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]`.

2. **Index `s`**:
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - In the example, `s` would be `6` because the last element before `-1` is at index `6`.

3. **`arr` Construction**:
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - For the example `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]`, the segments are:
     - `[1]` -> `(7, 0, 1)`
     - `[2, 2]` -> `(7, 1, 2)`
     - `[3, 3, 3]` -> `(7, 2, 3)`
   - Therefore, `arr` would be `[(7, 0, 1), (7, 1, 2), (7, 2, 3)]`.

4. **`LA` Calculation**:
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - In the example, `LA` would be `2` because `arr` has 3 elements.

5. **`eli` Calculation**:
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - If `l` is `2`, then `eli` would be `1` because the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(2, 0, 0)` is `(7, 1, 2)`.

6. **`s` and `e` Extraction**:
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - In the example, if `eli` is `1` and `LA` is `2`, then `min(eli, LA)` is `1`.
   - The tuple at index `1` in `arr` is `(7, 1, 2)`.
   - Therefore, `s` is `7` and `e` is `1`.

7. **Print Statement**:
   - The code prints `s` and `e + 1`.
   - In the example, `s` is `7` and `e + 1` is `2 + 1` which is `3`.

### Final Output:
Output: **7, 3 (where `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and `e + 1` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` plus 1)**

This output is based on the given initial state and the structure of the problem. The exact values of `s` and `e` will depend on the specific input values for `nums`, `l`, and `r`.
