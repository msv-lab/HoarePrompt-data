Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `ppp` is 23 if `tc` is greater than 5, and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. Additionally, `s` is less than or equal to `l`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values of `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, but these values are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The value of `ppp` is determined by conditions involving `tc`, `e`, and `r`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output `-1, -1` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **-1, -1**
