Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - Either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions**:
   - Since `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, it must be a positive integer.
   - `c` is calculated as `min(2, cntl[0]) - 1`.
     - If `cntl[0]` is 1, then `c = min(2, 1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`.
     - If `cntl[0]` is 2 or greater, then `c = min(2, cntl[0]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2, which means `cntl[1]` is either 0 or 1.
   - Either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.

3. **Determining the Value of `j`**:
   - Given that `j` is 1 and `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `cntl[1]` must be either 0 or 1.
   - Since `c` is either 0 or 1, and the condition states that either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `c` is 0, then the condition `c == 0` is satisfied, and `j` can be 1.
     - If `c` is 1, then the condition `j == n` must be satisfied for the overall condition to hold true.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `j` is 1 and the condition `j == n` must be considered, the only way for the condition to be true is if `n` is 1.
   - Therefore, `j` is 1 and `n` is 1.

Output: **1**
