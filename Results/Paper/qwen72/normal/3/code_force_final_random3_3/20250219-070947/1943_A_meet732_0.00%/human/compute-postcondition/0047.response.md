Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `j` and `c` are not affected.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `cntl` will contain the counts of each integer in the list `a`. Specifically, the element at index `i` in `cntl` will be the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. The variables `j` and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
