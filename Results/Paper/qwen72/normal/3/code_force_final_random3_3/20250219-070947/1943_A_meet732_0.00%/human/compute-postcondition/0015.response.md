The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `n + 1` must be greater than 1). The variable `j` will start at 1 and increment up to `n`.

Given that `n` is already stated to be greater than 0, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The variable `j` should start at 1, which is the initial condition for the loop to begin.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the value of `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1**
