#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. For each test case, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the output is 0. Otherwise, the output is the first index `j` in the range 1 to `n` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. The loop has printed the output for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function prints a result based on the following criteria: If the integer 0 does not appear in the list, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the smallest index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where the integer `j` appears fewer than 2 times in the list, or `n` if no such index exists. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
