The only objects in the loop head are variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The state of `n` and `cntl` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`**
