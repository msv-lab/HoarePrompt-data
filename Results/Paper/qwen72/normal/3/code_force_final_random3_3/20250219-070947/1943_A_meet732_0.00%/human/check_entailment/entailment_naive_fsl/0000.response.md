Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` contains no elements that are `0`. According to the problem description, if the array `a` does not contain `0`, the MEX of the final array `c` should be `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. However, the program incorrectly checks `cntl[0]` to determine if `0` is present, and if `cntl[0] == 0`, it prints `0` immediately, which is incorrect.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4

Output:
0
```

In this case, the array `a` does not contain `0`, so the MEX of the final array `c` should be `0`. However, the optimal play would involve Alice and Bob picking elements in such a way that the MEX of `c` is actually `1` (since `0` is not in the array, and the smallest non-negative integer that can be excluded is `1`).

The correct approach should be to find the smallest integer `k` such that `k` appears fewer than twice in the array `a`, and then determine the MEX based on the optimal strategy of Alice and Bob. The program's logic for handling this is flawed, leading to incorrect results for certain cases.
