Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list `a` of integers. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Counting Elements**: The function initializes a list `cntl` of length `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. This is appropriate because the integers in `a` are in the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0**: The function checks if `cntl[0]` is 0. If 0 does not appear in the list `a`, the MEX of the final array `c` will be 0, and the function correctly prints 0.

4. **Optimal Play Logic**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the function initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most 2 zeros to maximize the MEX.
   - The function then iterates through the range `[1, n]` to find the smallest index `j` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2. This is the correct approach because:
     - Alice will try to pick the smallest integer that appears at least once to maximize the MEX.
     - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that appears at least once to minimize the MEX.
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that either Alice or Bob (or both) will have picked this integer, and the MEX will be `j`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the correct MEX value for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all integers from 0 to `n-1` appear at least twice, the MEX will be `n`, which is correctly handled by the loop.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly handle the problem as described and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
