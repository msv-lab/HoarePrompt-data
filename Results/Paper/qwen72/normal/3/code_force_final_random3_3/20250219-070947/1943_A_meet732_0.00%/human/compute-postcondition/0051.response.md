Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `j` and `c` are not affected, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`**. 

In natural language: The variable `c` is now set to the minimum value between 2 and the count of how many times the integer 0 appears in the list `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
