The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1, where `i` is the second element in the list `a`. Let's break down the output state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 1.
   - `j` and `c` are not affected if `cntl[0]` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `j` is `n` and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`.
   - `i` is the second element in `a`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
   - The value of `i` is the second element in `a`.

3. **Output State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 2 (since `cntl[i]` was initially 1 and is incremented by 1).
   - `j` and `c` are not affected if `cntl[0]` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `j` is `n` and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`.
   - `i` is the second element in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 2, `j` and `c` are not affected if `cntl[0]` is 0, otherwise `j` is `n` and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`, `i` is the second element in `a`.**
