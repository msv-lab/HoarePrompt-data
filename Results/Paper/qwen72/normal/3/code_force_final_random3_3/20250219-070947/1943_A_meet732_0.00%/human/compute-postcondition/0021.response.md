Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1, `j` is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
