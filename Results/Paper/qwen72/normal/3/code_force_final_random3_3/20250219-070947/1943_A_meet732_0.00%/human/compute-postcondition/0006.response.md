The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the second integer in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.**
