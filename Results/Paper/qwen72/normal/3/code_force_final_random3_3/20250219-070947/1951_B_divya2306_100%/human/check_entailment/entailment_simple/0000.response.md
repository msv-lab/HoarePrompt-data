### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`, followed by the list of ratings `a`.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `wins` to 0 and iterates through the list `a` to count how many consecutive matches your cow can win without any swaps.
   - The loop breaks when it encounters the first cow with a higher rating than your cow.

3. **Condition for No Swap:**
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means your cow can win all the matches up to its original position without any swaps. The program then prints `wins - 1` and returns.
   - This is because the first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2, and the number of matches your cow can win is `wins - 1`.

4. **Wins Calculation with Swap:**
   - If `wins` is less than `k`, the program calculates the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve if it is swapped with another cow.
   - It initializes `win_with_swap` to `wins + 1` and iterates from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1` to count how many additional matches your cow can win after the swap.
   - The loop breaks when it encounters the first cow with a higher rating than your cow after the swap.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.
   - The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` accounts for the wins before and after the swap, and the term `(wins != 0)` ensures that if your cow wins at least one match without swapping, it is counted.

### Issues:
- **Function Definition:** The function `func_1()` should be defined with parameters to match the problem description, i.e., `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):`.
- **Return Statement:** The return statement in the function is unnecessary and can be removed.
- **Logic for Swap Calculation:** The logic for calculating `win_with_swap` is incorrect. It should consider the optimal position to swap your cow to maximize its wins, not just a fixed range from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max_wins(n, k, a)

def max_wins(n, k, ratings):
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if ratings[i] < ratings[k - 1]:
            wins += 1
        else:
            break

    if wins >= k - 1:
        print(wins)
        return

    win_with_swap = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings[i] < ratings[k - 1]:
            win_with_swap += 1
        else:
            break

    for i in range(k, n):
        if ratings[i] < ratings[k - 1]:
            win_with_swap += 1
        else:
            break

    print(max(wins, win_with_swap - 1))
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition:** The function `max_wins(n, k, ratings)` is defined with the correct parameters.
- **Initial Wins Calculation:** The loop correctly counts the number of consecutive wins your cow can achieve without any swaps.
- **Optimal Swap Calculation:** The program calculates the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve if it is swapped optimally. It first counts the wins up to the point where the first higher-rated cow is encountered, and then continues counting wins from the position `k` to the end of the list.
- **Final Output:** The program prints the maximum of the wins without swapping and the wins with the optimal swap, adjusted by subtracting 1 to account for the initial match.

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical issues in the swap calculation and function definition.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
