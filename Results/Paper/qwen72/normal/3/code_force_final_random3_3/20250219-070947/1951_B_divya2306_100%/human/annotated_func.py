#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow, and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and all `a_i` are distinct.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n - 1`, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to the point where the first element greater than `a[k - 1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to the point where the first element greater than `a[k - 1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found, and wins is greater than or equal to `k`)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`i` is `n - 1`, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to the point where the first element greater than `a[k - 1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found, and `wins` is less than `k`
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + (k - 1 - win_with_swap)`, `wins` is less than `k`, and `k` remains the same.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: k - 2 (if wins is 0) or k - 1 - wins (if wins is not 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `max_wins` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of cows), `k` (an integer representing the index of your cow), and `ratings` (a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows). It calculates the maximum number of cows that can be placed before your cow (at index `k-1`) such that your cow's rating is still higher than or equal to the ratings of all the cows before it. If this number is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of cows that can be placed before your cow after a potential swap with another cow, and prints the result. The function does not return any value.
