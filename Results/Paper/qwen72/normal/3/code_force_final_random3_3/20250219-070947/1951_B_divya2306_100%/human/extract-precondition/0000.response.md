Precondition: **The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow, and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and all `a_i` are distinct.**
