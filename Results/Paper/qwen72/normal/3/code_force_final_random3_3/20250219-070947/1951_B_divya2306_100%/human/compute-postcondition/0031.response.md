To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`. The loop condition is `i < k - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n`
- `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`
- `k` remains the same
- `n` is less than `k - 1`

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < k - 1`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`
   - `k` remains the same
   - `n` is less than `k - 1`

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Since `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `win_with_swap` remains `win_with_swap + 2` because it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `k` remains the same.

4. **Loop Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k - 1`.
   - Therefore, `n + 1` must be less than `k - 1`.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`, `k` remains the same, and `n + 1` must be less than `k - 1`**.
