Initial State: `c` is 3, `l` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 0 if `s[1]` is not 'L', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `n - 2` if `s[1]` is not 'L', `res` is a list of length `n` where the first and second elements are `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[1]` is 'L', the third element of `res` is `ans // arr[l] % m % MOD`. If `s[1]` is not 'L', the third element of `res` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`. The rest of the elements in `res` are 0. `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first element if `s[1]` is 'L' and except the last element if `s[1]` is not 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `ans // arr[r] % MOD` if `s[1]` is not 'L'. `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, and `k` is 2.

Code:
```
res[c] = ans % m % MOD
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
2. `c` is 3, so `res[3]` is updated.
3. `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first element if `s[1]` is 'L' and except the last element if `s[1]` is not 'L'.
4. `ans` is then updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `ans // arr[r] % MOD` if `s[1]` is not 'L'.
5. `res` is a list of length `n` where the first and second elements are `ans % m % MOD`.
6. The third element of `res` is `ans // arr[l] % m % MOD` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `ans // arr[r] % MOD` if `s[1]` is not 'L'.
7. The rest of the elements in `res` are 0.
8. `MOD` remains unchanged.
9. `n` must be at least 3.
10. `m` is an input integer.
11. `s` is a list of characters input by the user.
12. `k` is 2.

Output State: **`c` is 3, `l` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 0 if `s[1]` is not 'L', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `n - 2` if `s[1]` is not 'L', `res` is a list of length `n` where the first and second elements are `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[1]` is 'L', the third element of `res` is `ans // arr[l] % m % MOD` and the fourth element of `res` is `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[1]` is not 'L', the third element of `res` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and the fourth element of `res` is `ans % m % MOD`. The rest of the elements in `res` are 0. `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first element if `s[1]` is 'L' and except the last element if `s[1]` is not 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `ans // arr[r] % MOD` if `s[1]` is not 'L'. `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, and `k` is 2.**
