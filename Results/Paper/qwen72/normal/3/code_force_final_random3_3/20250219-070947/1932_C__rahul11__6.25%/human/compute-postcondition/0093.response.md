Postcondition: ***`c` is increased by 1, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated based on the first character of the string `s`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l-1] % MOD`, `res[0]` and `res[1]` are `ans % m % MOD` before the update, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` after the update, and `l` is `l + 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[0]` and `res[1]` are `ans % m % MOD` based on the old value of `ans`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` based on the old value of `ans`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `r` is `r - 1`. `k` remains 0.***
