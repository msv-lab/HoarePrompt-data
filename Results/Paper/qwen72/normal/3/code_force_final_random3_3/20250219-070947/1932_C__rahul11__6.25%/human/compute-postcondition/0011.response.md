The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the elements of `arr`, which is a list of two integers `[n, m]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `arr`, which is `n`. The state of `arr` does not change, but the state of `i` does.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `m * m`, `i` is `n`**
