You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `k` (0 ≤ k < n) is `ans % m % MOD` after the corresponding iteration, `ans` is the final value after all updates based on the characters in `s`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `k` is `n - 1`, and `MOD` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 and then multiplies it by each element of `arr` to get the product of all elements.
   - This is correct for calculating the initial product of the array.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program calculates the remainder of the product `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.
   - The additional modulo `MOD` (10^9 + 6) is unnecessary and can be removed since the problem only requires the remainder modulo `m`.

4. **Command Processing**:
   - The program iterates through the command string `s` and processes each command.
   - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element of the array, updates `res`, and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element of the array, updates `res`, and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - The division `ans // arr[l]` and `ans // arr[r]` is correct for removing the element from the product.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Modulo `MOD`**: The program uses an additional modulo `MOD` (10^9 + 6) which is not required by the problem statement. This can be removed to simplify the code and avoid potential issues.
- **Division and Modulo Order**: The division `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans // arr[r] % MOD` should be `ans // arr[l]` and `ans // arr[r]` followed by a single modulo `m` operation. The current order of operations can lead to incorrect results if `MOD` is not a multiple of `m`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l]
                res[c] = ans % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r]
                res[c] = ans % m
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program correctly processes the commands and outputs the remainders as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the unnecessary `MOD` and incorrect division and modulo order). However, the corrected program is **True**.
