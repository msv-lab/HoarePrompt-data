Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the 4th element updated to `ans % m % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise the 3rd element is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. `i` is `m`, `k` is 2, and the second character of `s` is 'L' or not 'L' as per the condition. `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`. `c` is 4 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `c` is 3. `l` is 2 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1. `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3` if `s[k]` is 'L' and `n - 4` otherwise.**
