Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1.**

The code snippet `c = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `c`. The values of `arr`, `i`, `ans`, and `res[0]` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition that `c` is now 1.
