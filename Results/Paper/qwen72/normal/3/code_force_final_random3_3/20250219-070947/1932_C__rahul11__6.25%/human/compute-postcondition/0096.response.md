Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `c` is `n - 1`
- `l` is `n - 1`
- `r` is 0
- `res` is a list of length `n - 1` where each element is `ans % m % MOD` based on the corresponding update of `ans` during each iteration.
- `ans` is the final value after all updates based on the characters in `s` from index 0 to `n-2`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`res` List**: The list `res` is described as having a length of `n - 1`. Each element in `res` is the result of `ans % m % MOD` for each iteration of the loop. This means that each element in `res` is the modulo operation applied twice to `ans` with `m` and `MOD`.

2. **`ans` Value**: `ans` is the final value after all updates based on the characters in `s` from index 0 to `n-2`. The exact value of `ans` is not provided, but it is updated during the loop based on the characters in `s`.

3. **`m` and `MOD`**: The values of `m` and `MOD` are not explicitly given, but they are used in the modulo operations to determine the elements of `res`.

4. **Printing `res`**: The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the list `res` and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `ans`, `m`, and `MOD` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **[ans % m % MOD, ans % m % MOD, ..., ans % m % MOD] (where each element is the result of `ans % m % MOD` for the corresponding iteration, and the list has `n - 1` elements)**

This means that the output will be a sequence of `n - 1` elements, each of which is the result of the modulo operations applied to `ans` as described.
