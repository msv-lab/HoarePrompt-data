Output State: **`c` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is also `ans % m % MOD`, the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first element, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, `k` is 0, and the first character of `s` is 'L'.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
