Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `i` is `m`, `c` is 3 if `s[k]` is 'L' and 2 otherwise, `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L' and 0 otherwise, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L' and `n - 2` otherwise, `k` is 1, and the first character of `s` is 'L' or not 'L' as per the condition.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` updates the value of `ans`.
- The value of `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `s[k]` is 'L' or not.
- The value of `ans` is divided by `arr[r]` and then taken modulo `MOD`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
