Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `n * m`, `i` is `m`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `arr`, which contains two integers `n` and `m`.
- After the first iteration, `ans` is multiplied by `n`, so `ans` becomes `n`.
- After the second iteration, `ans` is multiplied by `m`, so `ans` becomes `n * m`.
- Since `arr` only contains two elements, the loop will not execute a third time.
- Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be `n * m`.
- The value of `i` at the end of the loop will be the last element of `arr`, which is `m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `arr`, `s`, `res`) remain unchanged.
