Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, but `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is 2, `i` is 1, `x + 1` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Initially, `z` is 1.
- The expression `z // (k - 1)` evaluates to 0 because `z` is 1 and `k - 1` is a positive integer.
- Therefore, `z` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition `x + 1` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
