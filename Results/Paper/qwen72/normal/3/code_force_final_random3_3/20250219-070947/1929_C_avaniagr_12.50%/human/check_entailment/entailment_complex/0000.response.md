Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` given the parameters `k`, `x`, and `a`. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the casino's promotion and how Sasha can use it to his advantage.

### Key Points:
1. **Winning and Losing Rules**:
   - If Sasha wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - If Sasha loses, his coins decrease by `y`.

2. **Promotion Rule**:
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

3. **Initial Coins**:
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.

### Strategy:
- **If `x < k - 1`**:
  - In this case, Sasha can always recover from a series of losses because the number of consecutive losses allowed (`x`) is less than the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win (`k - 1`). This means that even if he loses `x` times, he can still win back more than he lost with a single win.
  - Therefore, if `a >= x + 1`, Sasha can always guarantee to win any number of coins.

- **If `x == k - 1`**:
  - In this case, the number of consecutive losses allowed is exactly equal to the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win. Sasha needs a bit more initial coins to ensure he can recover.
  - If `a >= x + 3`, Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins. This is because he needs to have enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario where he loses `x` times and then wins once.

- **If `x > k - 1`**:
  - Here, the number of consecutive losses allowed is greater than the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win. Sasha needs to calculate a threshold `z` to determine if he can guarantee winning any number of coins.
  - The threshold `z` is calculated by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times and then wins once, repeatedly. The formula used in the program is incorrect and should be:
    - `z = 0`
    - For `i` in range `x + 1`:
      - `z = z * (k - 1) + 1`
  - If `a >= z`, Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins.

### Issues in the Program:
- The calculation of `z` is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
  - `z = 0`
  - For `i` in range `x + 1`:
    - `z = z * (k - 1) + 1`

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z = z * (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `z`. The corrected program should use the formula `z = z * (k - 1) + 1` to calculate the threshold.

Correctness: **False**
