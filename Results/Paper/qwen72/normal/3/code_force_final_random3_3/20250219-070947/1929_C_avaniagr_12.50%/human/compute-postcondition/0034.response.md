Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user.

### Conditions:
1. **If `x` is less than `k - 1`:**
   - **If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`:**
     - `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - **Otherwise:**
     - `a` is less than `x + 1`.

2. **If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`:**
   - **If `x` is equal to `k - 1`:**
     - **If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`:**
       - `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.
     - **Otherwise:**
       - `a` is less than `x + 3`.
   - **If `x` is greater than `k - 1`:**
     - `z` is `x + 1`.
     - `i` is `x`.
     - `x + 1` is greater than `x`.
     - **If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`:**
       - `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - **If `a` is less than `z`:**
       - `a` is less than `x + 1`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the print statement directly. They only describe the relationships between the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`.
- The print statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` or the conditions they satisfy.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
