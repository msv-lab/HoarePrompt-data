The code snippet `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three integer values from the user input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The previous values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are replaced by the new values provided by the user. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**
