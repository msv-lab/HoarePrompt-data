You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `cases` where `t` is the number of test cases and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each iteration are provided by the user. For each iteration, the conditions checked within the loop remain the same: if `x` is less than `k - 1`, `a` is checked against `x + 1`; if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, `a` is checked against `x + 3`; if `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is calculated based on the loop, and `a` is checked against `z`. The final output state will reflect the results of these checks for all `t` test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place bets in a casino where a win multiplies his bet by `k` and a loss results in losing the bet amount.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will lose a total of `y1 + y2 + ... + yx` coins, where `yi` is the bet amount on the `i`-th loss.
   - After `x` consecutive losses, Sasha must win the next bet to continue betting.
   - The strategy should ensure that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - The program then checks different conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve the goal.

4. **Conditions in the Program:**
   - **If `x < k - 1`:**
     - If Sasha can lose fewer times than `k - 1` in a row, he can always recover by betting a small amount.
     - The program checks if `a >= x + 1`. This condition ensures that Sasha has enough coins to cover `x` consecutive losses and still have at least 1 coin left to place a bet.
   - **If `x == k - 1`:**
     - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, he needs a bit more initial coins to ensure recovery.
     - The program checks if `a >= x + 3`. This condition is not clear and seems incorrect. It should be `a >= x + 1` to ensure recovery.
   - **If `x > k - 1`:**
     - The program calculates a value `z` which represents the total number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses.
     - The loop `for i in range(x + 1): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is intended to simulate the recovery process, but it is not clear and seems to be incorrect.

5. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The condition `if x < k - 1` is correct because Sasha can always recover with a small bet.
   - The condition `if x == k - 1` is incorrect. It should be `a >= x + 1` instead of `a >= x + 3`.
   - The condition `if x > k - 1` is also incorrect. The loop does not correctly simulate the recovery process and the logic is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the conditions for `x == k - 1` and `x > k - 1`.

### Correctness: **False**
