Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user.
   - `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
   - `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions for the variables `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in any way.
   - The `print` statement will execute regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, as long as the initial state is satisfied.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` because it is a simple constant string and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
