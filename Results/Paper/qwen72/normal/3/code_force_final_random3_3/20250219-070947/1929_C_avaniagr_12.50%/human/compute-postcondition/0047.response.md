Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k` is an integer provided by the user, `x` must be at least 0, `a` is an integer provided by the user, `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 1.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `k` remains an integer provided by the user.
- The variable `x` must be at least 0, as the loop runs from 0 to `x` inclusive.
- The variable `a` remains an integer provided by the user, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `z` starts at 0 and is incremented by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration of the loop. After `x + 1` iterations, `z` will be `x + 1`.
- The variable `i` will be `x` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from 0 to `x` inclusive, and `i` is the loop counter.
