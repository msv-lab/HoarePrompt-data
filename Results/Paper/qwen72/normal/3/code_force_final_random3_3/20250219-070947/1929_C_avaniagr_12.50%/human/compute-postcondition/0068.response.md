The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `x` must still be at least 0 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 2, `i` is 2**
