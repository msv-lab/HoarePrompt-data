Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x` using the third element of `arr`, `ry` is the result of `a % y` using the third element of `arr`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)` using the third element of `arr`. If `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
