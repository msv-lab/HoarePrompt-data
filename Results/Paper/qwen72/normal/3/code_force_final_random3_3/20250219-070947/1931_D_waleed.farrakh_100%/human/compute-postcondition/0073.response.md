Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, and the third tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- `results` is a list that contains the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been encountered before it was added to `freq` for all elements `a` in `arr`.
- The code snippet `count = 0` sets the value of `count` to 0.
- Since no other variables are affected by this code, their initial states remain unchanged.
