Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is 7, `test_cases` is a list containing three tuples: `(n, x, y, arr)`, `(n, x, y, arr)`, and `(n, x, y, arr)`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting `data[5]`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `data[6]`.**

The value of `idx` has been incremented by 2, changing from 5 to 7. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
