Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` has `n` elements, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) is in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` is updated to `freq[rx, ry]`, where `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1, and `count` remains 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not a key in `freq`, or is updated to `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`. `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of `a % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the count of `current_pair` in `freq` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq` is updated to include `current_pair` with a count of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)` using the third element of `arr`) is already in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a value of 1. `a` is the third element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x` using the third element of `arr`, `ry` is the result of `a % y` using the third element of `arr`. `count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
