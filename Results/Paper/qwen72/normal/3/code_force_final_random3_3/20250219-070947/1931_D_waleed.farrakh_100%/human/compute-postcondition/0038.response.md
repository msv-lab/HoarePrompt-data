Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` has `n` elements, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `count` is 0.**

The code snippet `count = 0` reassigns the value of `count` to 0. Since `count` was already 0 in the initial state, there is no change in its value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
