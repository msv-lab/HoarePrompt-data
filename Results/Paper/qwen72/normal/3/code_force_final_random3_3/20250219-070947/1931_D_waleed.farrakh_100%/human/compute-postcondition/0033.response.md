Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq` now contains the key `current_pair` with the value 1 or 2, and `count` is updated to 1. If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, `freq` is updated to contain `current_pair` with the value 1.***
