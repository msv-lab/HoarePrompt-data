The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` splits the string at the index `idx` of the list `data` into multiple parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since `idx` is 1, the string at `data[1]` is split and its parts are converted to integers. The initial state specifies that `data` is not provided, but `idx` is 1 and `test_cases` is an empty list. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not used, `idx` is 1, `test_cases` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting `data[1]`.**
