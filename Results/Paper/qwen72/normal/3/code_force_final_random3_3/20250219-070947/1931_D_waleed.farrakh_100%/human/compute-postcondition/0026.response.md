The only objects in the loop head are the variables `result` and the iterable `results`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses through the iterable `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (this is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `results` is an iterable with at least two elements.
- `result` is the current element being processed in the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, the iterable `results` must have at least one more element to process. Since `results` had at least two elements at the end of the previous iteration, it must now have at least one element remaining for the loop to continue. The variable `result` will be updated to the next element in `results`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an iterable with at least one element, `result` is the next element in `results`**
