Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `current_pair` set to 1, `count` is 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not a key in `freq`. If `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`, `count` is `freq[rx, ry]`. `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.** 

The code snippet updates the `freq` dictionary by adding the key `current_pair` and setting its value to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
