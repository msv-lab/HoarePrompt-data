Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`, and `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for the last tuple in `test_cases`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, as it was before the loop started.
- The `results` list now contains the final value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each value in `results` corresponds to the number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that were encountered more than once during the processing of each tuple.
- The `freq` dictionary contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for the last tuple in `test_cases` that was processed by the loop. This dictionary reflects the counts of these pairs for the final test case only.
