Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been encountered before it was added to `freq` for all elements `a` in `arr`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, containing at least 2 tuples.
- The second tuple in `test_cases` is `(n, x, y, arr)`, where `arr` has `n` elements.
- The `results` list now contains the final value of `count` after all iterations of the loop.
- The `freq` dictionary contains the frequency of each pair `(a % x, a % y)` for every element `a` in `arr`.
- The `count` variable is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been encountered before it was added to `freq` for all elements `a` in `arr`. This means `count` reflects the number of pairs that have been seen more than once during the loop execution.
