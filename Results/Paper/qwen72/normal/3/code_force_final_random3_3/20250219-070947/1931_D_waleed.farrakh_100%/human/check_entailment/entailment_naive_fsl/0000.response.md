Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It then iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` for each element `a`:
     - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x` to handle negative remainders.
     - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary and increments the count if it is.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count to the results list.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads the input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into lines.
   - It parses the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, parsing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. It ensures that the pairs are counted only if both conditions are met, and it efficiently uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the pairs, which helps in reducing the time complexity. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
