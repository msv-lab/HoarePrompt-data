### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function reads from standard input and processes each test case correctly.
   - It splits the input into lines and parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - The state of the program after `func_2` is called is correct, with `test_cases` containing the required tuples.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is the smallest non-negative integer such that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `ry = a % y` ensures that `ry` is the smallest non-negative integer such that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary and increments `count` if it is.
   - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - The state of the program after `func_1` is called is correct, with `results` containing the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

3. **Output in `func_2`:**
   - After calling `func_1`, `func_2` prints each result in the `results` list.
   - The state of the program after printing is correct, with all results printed and the program concluding.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs, and prints the results. The logic and state transitions are consistent with the problem description and the provided annotations.

### Correctness:
**True**
