Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been encountered before it was added to `freq` for all elements `a` in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`.
- `results` now contains the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `freq`, and `count`) remain unchanged in terms of their values and structure.
