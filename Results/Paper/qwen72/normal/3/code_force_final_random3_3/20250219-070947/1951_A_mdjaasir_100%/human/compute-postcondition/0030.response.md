Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If the character following the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not '1', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.***
