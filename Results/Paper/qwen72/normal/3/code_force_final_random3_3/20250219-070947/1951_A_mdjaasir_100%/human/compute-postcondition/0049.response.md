The function `func` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`. Both `start` and `end` are integers, and they define the range of folder names to be considered, where folder names are expected to be numeric. The parameter `start` must be less than or equal to `end`. The function returns a list of folder names that are numeric and fall within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are integers such that `start` <= `end`. It returns a list of numeric folder names within the range defined by `start` and `end`.**
