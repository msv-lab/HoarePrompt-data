It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, not `func()`. Let's correct that and provide the precondition for the intended function.

Function definition:
```
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, and they define the range of folder names to be considered, where folder names are expected to be numeric.**
