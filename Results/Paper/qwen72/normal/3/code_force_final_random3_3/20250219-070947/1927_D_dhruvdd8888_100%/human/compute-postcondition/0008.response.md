To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 0, and `i` starts at 0. The other variables and objects mentioned in the state before the loop are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop:
- `N` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from `sys.stdin` with an additional `-1` appended at the end.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`.
- `arr` is an empty list.

The loop will execute if `N` is at least 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `N` to ensure it is non-negative.

State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0**
