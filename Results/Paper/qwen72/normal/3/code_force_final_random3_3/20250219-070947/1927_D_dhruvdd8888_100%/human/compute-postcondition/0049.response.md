Output State: **`_` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` > `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `r`. If `s` â‰¤ `l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r` and if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, the current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` updates the value of `eli` to the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
- The initial state remains unchanged for all other variables.
- The conditions on `s` and `e` remain the same as they are based on the value of `eli` and the contents of `arr`.
- The value of `eli` is now specifically defined as the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
