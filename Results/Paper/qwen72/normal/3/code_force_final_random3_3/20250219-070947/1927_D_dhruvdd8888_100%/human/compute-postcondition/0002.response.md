Output State: **The function is still expected to take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The list `a` should have a length of 2 to 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` should be an integer between 1 and 10^6. The number of queries `q` should be a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The `input` function now reads from `sys.stdin`. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a list of integers read from `sys.stdin`.**
