Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is the last element of `nums` (which is `-1`), and `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, each tuple in the form `(1 + s, i, num)` where `s` is the start index of the range and `i` is the end index of the range. `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` (which is `N`).**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has run from `i = 0` to `i = N`, completing all iterations.
- The variable `i` is now equal to `N`.
- The variable `num` is set to the last element of the list `nums`, which is `-1` (since `-1` was appended at the end of `nums`).
- The list `arr` contains tuples that represent the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal. Each tuple is in the form `(start_index + 1, end_index, value)`, where `start_index` is the starting index of the range, `end_index` is the ending index of the range, and `value` is the value of the elements in that range.
- The variable `s` is now equal to `N`, which is the index of the last element in `nums`.
