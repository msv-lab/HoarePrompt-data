Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1. This means the user input is an integer greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split. This implies that the user input is a string that can be split into two integers, `l` and `r`.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The user input is an integer greater than 1. Let's denote this integer as `n`.
   - The input is then split into two integers, `l` and `r`. For example, if the input is "3 5", then `l` is 3 and `r` is 5.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This means `arr` is a sorted list of tuples, and `eli` is the position where `(l, 0, 0)` would fit in.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Here, `LA` is the length of `arr`.
   - The third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`. This means `_` will be updated to the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the first element `s` of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` and the second element `e` of the same tuple incremented by 1.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, and `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s and e are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr, and eli is the index where the tuple (l, 0, 0) would be inserted in arr to maintain sorted order)**
