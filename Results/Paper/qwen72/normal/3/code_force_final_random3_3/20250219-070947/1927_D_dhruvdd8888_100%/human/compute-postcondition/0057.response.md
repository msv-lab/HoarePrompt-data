Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`. If `e < N` or `e < l`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.***
