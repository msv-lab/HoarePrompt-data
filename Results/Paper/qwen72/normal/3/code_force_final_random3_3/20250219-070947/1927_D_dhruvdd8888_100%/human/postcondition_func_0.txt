The function reads a list of integers and a series of queries from standard input. Each query consists of two integers `(l, r)` where `1 <= l < r <= n`. The function processes these queries to find and print pairs of indices `(x, y)` such that `x < y` and the elements at these indices are different. If no such pair exists within the query range, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.
