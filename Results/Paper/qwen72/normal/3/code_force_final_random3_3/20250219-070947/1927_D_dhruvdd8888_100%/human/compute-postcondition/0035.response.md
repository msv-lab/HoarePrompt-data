Postcondition: ***`_` is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `s` is greater than `l`. If `s` is 1 or greater than `r`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `r`.***
