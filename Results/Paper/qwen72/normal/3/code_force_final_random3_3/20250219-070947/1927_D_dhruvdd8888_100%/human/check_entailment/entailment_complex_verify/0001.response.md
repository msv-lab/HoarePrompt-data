### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It iterates through the array to group consecutive elements that are the same into tuples `(start, end, value)` and stores them in `arr`.
   - `arr` will contain tuples representing segments of the array where all elements are the same.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the query boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It retrieves the segment `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)` where `LA` is the last index of `arr`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists:
     - If `s > l`, it checks if the segment starts after `l` and either:
       - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).
       - Otherwise, it prints `s - 1, s` (a valid pair).
     - If `e >= r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).
     - If `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `s, e + 1` (a valid pair).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `s > l`**
  - This checks if the segment starts after `l`. If so, it further checks:
    - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it means the segment starts at the beginning of the array or after `r`, so no valid pair exists.
    - Otherwise, it prints `s - 1, s` which is a valid pair because `s - 1` is the last element of the previous segment and `s` is the start of the current segment, and they must be different.

- **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
  - This checks if the segment ends at or after `r`. If so, it means the segment covers the entire query range, and no valid pair exists.

- **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
  - This checks if the segment ends before the end of the array or before `l`. If so, it prints `s, e + 1` which is a valid pair because `e + 1` is the start of the next segment and `s` is the start of the current segment, and they must be different.

### Potential Issues:
- **Sentinel Value:**
  - The sentinel value `-1` is appended to `nums` to handle edge cases. However, this might cause issues if the array already contains `-1` as a valid element. This is a valid concern, but the problem constraints specify that `1 \le a_i \le 10^6`, so `-1` is not a valid element and will not cause issues.
- **Condition Overlap:**
  - The conditions in the `if-elif-else` block are not mutually exclusive, which might lead to incorrect outputs. For example, if `s > l` and `e >= r`, the program might print `-1 -1` twice. This is a valid concern, but the program is designed to handle each condition in a specific order, and the `elif` and `else` blocks ensure that only one condition is checked and executed.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is generally correct, and the sentinel value `-1` is safe given the problem constraints.
- The conditions in the `if-elif-else` block are designed to handle all possible cases, and the order of conditions ensures that only one condition is executed per query.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment identified potential issues but did not provide a clear example where the program fails. Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
