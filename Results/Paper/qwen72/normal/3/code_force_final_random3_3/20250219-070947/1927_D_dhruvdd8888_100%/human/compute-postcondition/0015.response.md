Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 1, num)`, and `s` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a new tuple to the list `arr`.
- The value of `1 + s` is `1` because `s` is `0`.
- The value of `i` is `1`.
- The value of `num` is the element at index 0 of the list `nums`.
- Therefore, the tuple `(1, 1, num)` is appended to `arr`.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `num`, and `s` remain unchanged.
