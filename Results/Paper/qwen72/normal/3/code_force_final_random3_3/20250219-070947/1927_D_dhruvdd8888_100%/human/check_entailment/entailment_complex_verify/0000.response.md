### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called inside a loop that iterates `tc` times, which is correct for handling multiple test cases.
   - However, `func_1` itself reads input from `sys.stdin.readline` without resetting its state between test cases. This can lead to incorrect input handling and results for subsequent test cases.

2. **Segment Identification:**
   - The program uses a loop to identify segments of consecutive identical elements in the array `nums` and stores these segments in `arr` as tuples `(start, end, value)`.
   - The loop correctly identifies the segments and appends them to `arr`. The addition of `-1` to `nums` ensures that the last segment is always added to `arr`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be inserted.
   - The logic for handling queries is flawed:
     - **Case 1:** `if s > l`:
       - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, the program checks if `s` is 1 or greater than `r`. If `s` is 1 or greater than `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`. Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
       - This logic is incorrect because it assumes that the segment starting at `s` is the first segment that starts after `l`, but it does not check if there are any other segments within the range `[l, r]` that could have different elements.
     - **Case 2:** `elif e >= r`:
       - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the program prints `(-1, -1)`.
       - This logic is also incorrect because it assumes that the segment ending at `e` is the last segment that ends before or at `r`, but it does not check if there are any other segments within the range `[l, r]` that could have different elements.
     - **Case 3:** `elif e < N or e < l`:
       - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, the program prints `(s, e + 1)`.
       - This logic is incorrect because it assumes that the segment ending at `e` is the last segment that ends before `N` or `l`, but it does not check if there are any other segments within the range `[l, r]` that could have different elements.
     - **Case 4:** `else`:
       - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints `(-1, -1)`.
       - This logic is also incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the segment contains only one unique element or where the segment is entirely within a range of identical elements.
   - For example, in the input:
     ```
     2
     5
     1 1 2 1 1
     3
     1 5
     1 2
     1 3
     6
     30 20 20 10 10 20
     5
     1 2
     2 3
     2 4
     2 6
     3 5
     ```
     - The program will likely produce incorrect results for the second test case because it does not reset the state of `arr` and other variables between test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly the input handling and the logic for finding indices within the query range. The program fails to reset its state between test cases and does not correctly handle edge cases.

Final: **False**
