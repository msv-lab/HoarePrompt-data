### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
   - It initializes `s` and `e` to 0 and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases where the last element is different from the previous one.
   - It iterates over `nums` and constructs an array `arr` of tuples. Each tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` represents the start and end indices of a range of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, along with the value of the element.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of queries and then iterates over each query.
   - For each query, it reads the integers `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - It then extracts the start and end indices of the range from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the last valid index in `arr`.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - If `s > l` and `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, it prints `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the range.
   - If `s > l` and `s` is not 1 and is less than or equal to `r`, it prints `s - 1` and `s` because these indices represent the boundary of the range where the elements are different.
   - If `s <= l` and `e >= r`, it prints `-1 -1` because the range is entirely within a single segment of equal elements.
   - If `s <= l` and `e < r` and `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `s` and `e + 1` because these indices represent the boundary of the range where the elements are different.
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Range Handling:**
  - The program correctly identifies ranges of consecutive equal elements and stores them in `arr`.
  - However, the logic for handling queries is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for determining whether a pair of different elements exists are not correctly implemented.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program appends a `-1` to `nums` to handle the last element, but this can introduce incorrect behavior if the last element of `nums` is different from the previous one. This is because the tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` will include the `-1` as the last element, which is not part of the original array.

- **Query Logic:**
  - The conditions for checking if a pair of different elements exists within the query range are not comprehensive enough. For example, if `s` is greater than `l` but less than or equal to `r`, it should check if there is a different element in the range, not just print `s - 1` and `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical errors in the way it handles queries and edge cases. Specifically, the conditions for determining whether a pair of different elements exists within the query range are not correctly implemented, and the handling of the last element of `nums` can introduce incorrect behavior.

### Correctness:
**False**
