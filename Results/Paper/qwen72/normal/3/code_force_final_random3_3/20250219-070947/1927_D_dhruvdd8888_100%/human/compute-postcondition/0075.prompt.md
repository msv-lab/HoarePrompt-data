You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The list `a` should have a length of 2 to 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` should be an integer between 1 and 10^6. The number of queries `q` should be a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is the last element of `nums` (which is `-1`), and `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, each tuple in the form `(1 + s, i, num)` where `s` is the start index of the range and `i` is the end index of the range. `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` (which is `N`).
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, each tuple in the form `(1 + s, i, num)` where `s` is the start index of the range and `i` is the end index of the range. `s` is `N`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. For each iteration, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The conditions for the output remain consistent with the logic of the loop: if `s > l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `r`. If `s <= l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r` and if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, the current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of `a`, and a list of queries `q`. Each query is a tuple `(l, r)` where 1 <= l < r <= n. The function returns a list of results, where each result is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l-1:r]`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
