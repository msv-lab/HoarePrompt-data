Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `l` and `r` are integers from the input split.
- `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
- If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged.
- If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `eli` and `LA`:**
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `LA` is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred that `LA` is the length of the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - `min(eli, LA)` will be the index of the tuple in `arr` that is either the position where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted or the last index of `arr` if `eli` is greater than or equal to `LA`.
   - The tuple at this index is `(s, e, _)`.

3. **Determine `s` and `e`:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.

4. **Determine the output of the print statement:**
   - The print statement `print(s - 1, s)` will print the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state, the values of `s` and `e` are determined by the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The print statement will output `s - 1` and `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
