Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, which means `_` is an iterator over a range of integers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`. The value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split. This means the input is a string of two integers separated by a space, and `l` and `r` are the first and second integers, respectively.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This implies that `arr` is a sorted list of tuples.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is less than `r`.
   - The current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(s, e + 1)`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is the second element of the same tuple.
- `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
- `e` is less than `r`.
- The current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`.

The print statement will output:
- `s` as the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e + 1` as the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, incremented by 1.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `arr`, `LA`, and `N` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr, and e is the second element of the same tuple, with e being less than r and less than N or l)**
