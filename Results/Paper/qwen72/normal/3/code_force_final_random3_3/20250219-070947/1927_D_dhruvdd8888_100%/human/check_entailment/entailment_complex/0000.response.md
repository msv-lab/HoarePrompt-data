Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - The array `nums` is extended by appending `-1` to it, which is used to ensure the last range is captured in the `arr` list.

2. **Range Compression**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and compresses consecutive equal elements into ranges stored in `arr`.
   - Each tuple in `arr` is of the form `(start, end, value)`, where `start` and `end` are the indices of the range of equal elements in `nums`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if there is a pair of different elements within the range `[l, r]`:
     - If `s > l` and `s == 1` or `s > r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If `s > l` and `s != 1` and `s <= r`, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If `e >= r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the range `[l, r]` does not contain any different elements.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the range `[l, r]` is entirely within a single range of equal elements.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each query in the correct format.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, which is incorrect. The function should be called with the appropriate parameters (`a`, `n`, and `q`).

2. **Range Handling**:
   - The logic for handling the ranges and queries is not entirely correct. Specifically, the conditions for determining if a pair of different elements exists within the query range are not robust enough.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the query range `[l, r]` is entirely within a single range of equal elements correctly. It should check if the range `[l, r]` spans multiple ranges to ensure there are different elements.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
