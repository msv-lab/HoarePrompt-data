Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, there is an issue with how the program processes the input and queries. The function `func_1` is called inside a loop that iterates `tc` times, but `func_1` itself reads input from `sys.stdin.readline` without considering that it might be called multiple times for different test cases. This can lead to incorrect input handling and thus incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

Additionally, the logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. The program uses a binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the start of a segment where the elements are different, but it does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when the segment contains only one unique element or when the segment is entirely within a range of identical elements.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
6
30 20 20 10 10 20
5
1 2
2 3
2 4
2 6
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3

2 1
-1 -1
4 2
4 6
5 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely produce incorrect results for the second test case because it does not reset the state of `arr` and other variables between test cases, leading to incorrect segment identification and query handling.

To correct the program, it should reset the state of `arr` and other variables at the beginning of each test case and handle the input correctly for each test case.
