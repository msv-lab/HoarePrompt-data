### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It iterates through the array to group consecutive elements that are the same into tuples `(start, end, value)` and stores them in `arr`.
   - `arr` will contain tuples representing segments of the array where all elements are the same.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the query boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It retrieves the segment `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)` where `LA` is the last index of `arr`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists:
     - **Condition 1: `s > l`**
       - This checks if the segment starts after `l`. If so, it further checks:
         - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it means the segment starts at the beginning of the array or after `r`, so no valid pair exists.
         - Otherwise, it prints `s - 1, s` which is a valid pair because `s - 1` is the last element of the previous segment and `s` is the start of the current segment, and they must be different.
     - **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
       - This checks if the segment ends at or after `r`. If so, it means the segment covers the entire query range, and no valid pair exists.
     - **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
       - This checks if the segment ends before the end of the array or before `l`. If so, it prints `s, e + 1` which is a valid pair because `e + 1` is the start of the next segment and `s` is the start of the current segment, and they must be different.
     - **Else:**
       - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `s > l`**
  - This condition is correct. If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the segment starts at the beginning of the array or after `r`. If either is true, no valid pair exists. Otherwise, it prints `s - 1, s` which is a valid pair.

- **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
  - This condition is also correct. If the segment ends at or after `r`, it means the segment covers the entire query range, and no valid pair exists.

- **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
  - This condition is problematic. The condition `e < N` is always true because `e` is the end index of the segment, and the segment cannot end after the array. The condition `e < l` is redundant because if `e < l`, the segment would not be considered in the query range. This condition should be simplified to just `e < r`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Sentinel Value:**
  - The sentinel value `-1` is appended to `nums` to handle edge cases. This is a valid approach as long as `-1` is not a valid element in the input array. However, the problem statement guarantees that `1 \le a_i \le 10^6`, so `-1` is safe to use.
- **Condition Overlap:**
  - The conditions in the `if-elif-else` block are not mutually exclusive, which might lead to incorrect outputs. Specifically, the condition `e < N or e < l` is redundant and should be simplified.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

tc = int(input())
for ppp in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        num = nums[i]
    
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        if eli == LA:
            s, e, _ = arr[LA]
        else:
            s, e, _ = arr[eli]
        
        if s > l:
            if s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < r:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the potential issues with the sentinel value and the overlapping conditions.
- The corrected code addresses these issues by simplifying the conditions and ensuring that the `if-elif-else` block is mutually exclusive.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the redundant and overlapping conditions in the `if-elif-else` block. The corrected code ensures that the program works correctly for all valid inputs.
