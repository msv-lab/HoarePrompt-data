Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Use of `input` Function**:
   - The `input` function is being redefined inside `func_1`, which can lead to unexpected behavior. It's better to use a different variable name for the input function.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Handling Queries**:
   - The logic for handling queries is flawed. The program is trying to use a list `arr` to store ranges of consecutive identical elements, but the way it processes the queries is not correct.
   - Specifically, the conditions for checking if a valid pair exists are incorrect. The program should check if there are any two different elements within the given range `[l, r]`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same. It should print `-1 -1` in such cases, but the current logic does not always do this correctly.

4. **Appending `-1` to `nums`**:
   - Appending `-1` to the `nums` array is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the last element of `nums` is `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    tc = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for ppp in range(tc):
        N = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + N]))
        idx += N
        Q = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        
        # Preprocess the array to find the first and last occurrence of each number
        first_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        last_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if first_occurrence[num] == -1:
                first_occurrence[num] = i + 1
            last_occurrence[num] = i + 1
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            l, r = map(int, data[idx:idx + 2])
            idx += 2
            
            found = False
            for num in set(nums[l-1:r]):
                if first_occurrence[num] < l or last_occurrence[num] > r:
                    continue
                if not found:
                    found = True
                    first = first_occurrence[num]
                    last = last_occurrence[num]
                else:
                    results.append((first, first_occurrence[num]))
                    found = True
                    break
            
            if not found:
                results.append((-1, -1))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result[0], result[1])

# Example usage
# func_1()
```

### Corrected Explanation:
- **Preprocessing**:
  - We preprocess the array to store the first and last occurrence of each number in the array.
- **Query Handling**:
  - For each query, we check if there are at least two different numbers in the range `[l, r]`.
  - If there are, we print the indices of any two different elements.
  - If there are no different elements, we print `-1 -1`.

This corrected version should handle the problem correctly and efficiently.
