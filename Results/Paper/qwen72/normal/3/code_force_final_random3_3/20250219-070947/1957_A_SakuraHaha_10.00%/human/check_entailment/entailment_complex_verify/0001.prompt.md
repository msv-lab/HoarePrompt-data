You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `ans` is increased by the sum of each value in `cnt` divided by 4 (using integer division).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the described operations.
    #   - Based on the example, `ans` will be 1.
    #
    #Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can generalize the output based on the structure of the problem:
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then calculates the number of complete sets of four sticks of the same length that can be formed from the list `a`. The function prints this count and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input list `a` remains unchanged, and the count of complete sets of four sticks is printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies**: The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the frequency of each stick length. This is a correct approach to determine how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons**: The program then iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` and calculates the number of regular polygons that can be formed using the formula `x // 4`. This formula is based on the assumption that each polygon has 4 sides (i.e., a square). However, the problem statement does not specify that the polygons must be squares; it only states that they must be regular (equal-sided) polygons.

4. **Generalizing to Other Polygons**: The formula `x // 4` is only correct for squares. For other regular polygons, such as triangles (3 sides), pentagons (5 sides), hexagons (6 sides), etc., the formula would need to be adjusted. For example, for triangles, the formula would be `x // 3`, and for pentagons, it would be `x // 5`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of squares that can be formed. However, this does not meet the problem's requirement to find the maximum number of regular polygons, not just squares.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it only considers squares and does not account for other possible regular polygons.

Correctness: **False**
