To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers that remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
   - `ans` is a variable that is increased by the sum of each value in `cnt` divided by 4 (using integer division).

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a list of integers. For example, let's assume `a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. For the example list, `cnt` would be:
     ```python
     cnt = {1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4}
     ```
   - `ans` is a variable that is initially not specified, so we assume it starts at 0. The value of `ans` is then increased by the sum of each value in `cnt` divided by 4 (using integer division).

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - For each value in `cnt`, we perform integer division by 4 and sum the results.
   - For the example `cnt`:
     - `cnt[1] // 4 = 2 // 4 = 0`
     - `cnt[2] // 4 = 3 // 4 = 0`
     - `cnt[3] // 4 = 4 // 4 = 1`
   - Summing these results: `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Therefore, `ans` is increased by 1.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the described operations.
   - Based on the example, `ans` will be 1.

Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can generalize the output based on the structure of the problem:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of each value in the dictionary `cnt` divided by 4 using integer division)**
