Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `a` remains the same as it was initially. The dictionary `cnt` will contain each unique integer from the list `a` as a key, and the corresponding value for each key will be the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. The variable `ans` remains 0, and `cnt` is populated with the counts of each integer in `a`.
