Output State: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `n` is an input integer.**
