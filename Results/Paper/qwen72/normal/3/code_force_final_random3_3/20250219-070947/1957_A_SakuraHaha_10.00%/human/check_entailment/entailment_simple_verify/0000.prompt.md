You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `ans` is increased by the sum of each value in `cnt` divided by 4 (using integer division).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the described operations.
    #   - Based on the example, `ans` will be 1.
    #
    #Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can generalize the output based on the structure of the problem:
    #
    #Output:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem of constructing the maximum number of regular polygons. Specifically, the program only considers polygons with 4 sides (quadrilaterals) and does not account for polygons with different numbers of sides (e.g., triangles, pentagons, etc.). This is evident from the line `ans += x // 4`, which only counts the number of quadrilaterals that can be formed. For example, if the input is `6 2 2 3 3 3 3`, the program will output `0` because it only checks for quadrilaterals, whereas the correct output should be `1` (a square can be formed with the 4 sticks of length 3). Similarly, for the input `9 4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`, the program will output `2` (only considering squares), whereas the correct output should be `2` (one pentagon with side length 2 and one square with side length 4). However, the program will fail for inputs where other polygons can be formed but not quadrilaterals.
