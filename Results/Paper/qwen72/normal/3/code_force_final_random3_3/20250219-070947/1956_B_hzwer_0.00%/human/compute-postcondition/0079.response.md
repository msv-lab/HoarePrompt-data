Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The integer `n` represents the number of cards each player receives, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list. The function returns the maximum number of cards that can be taken under the given conditions, which is stored in `dp[0][0]`.**
