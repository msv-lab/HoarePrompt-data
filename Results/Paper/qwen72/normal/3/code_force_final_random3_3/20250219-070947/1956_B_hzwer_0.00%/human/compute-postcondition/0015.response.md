Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, and `j` is `n - 1`. If the integer `j + 1` does not appear in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the integer `j + 1` appears exactly once in the `cards` list, then `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)`. If the integer `j + 1` appears at least twice in the `cards` list, then `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n]`.***
