The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1 to `n - 2`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`. If the count of the value `j + 1` in the list `cards` is 0, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
