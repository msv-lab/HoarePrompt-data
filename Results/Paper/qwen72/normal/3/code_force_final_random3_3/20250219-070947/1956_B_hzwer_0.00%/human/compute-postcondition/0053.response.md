The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 3` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 4` and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to `n - 3`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `-1`.**
