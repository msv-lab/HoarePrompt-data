Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop and the value of `dp[i][j]` is now `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`; `n` is at least 3; `i` is `n - 3`; `j` is `n - 1`; `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and the condition regarding `cards` remain unchanged.
