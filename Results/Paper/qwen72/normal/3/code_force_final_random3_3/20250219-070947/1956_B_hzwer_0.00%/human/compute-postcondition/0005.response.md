To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `range(n - 3, -1, -1)` is not empty. This means that `n - 3` must be greater than or equal to 0, so `n` must be at least 3.

Before the loop starts, the state is:
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- The total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is at least 3 and `i` is initialized to `n - 3`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.**
