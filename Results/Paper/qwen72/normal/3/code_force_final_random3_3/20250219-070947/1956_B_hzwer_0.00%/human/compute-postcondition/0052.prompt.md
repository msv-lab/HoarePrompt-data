Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is 0. The `dp` table is filled such that for each `j` from `n - 1` down to 0, the value `dp[i][j]` is set based on the count of the integer `j + 1` in the `cards` list. If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears at least twice, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is `n - 1`. If the count of the value `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count of the value `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If the count of the value `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is `n - 2`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is `n - 3`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
