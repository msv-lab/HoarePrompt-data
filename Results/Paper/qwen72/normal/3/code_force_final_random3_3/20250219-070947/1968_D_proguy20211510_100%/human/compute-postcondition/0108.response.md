Output State: **`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the integer value `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integer `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` is now 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, which is the integer value at the index `pb - 1` in the list `p`.
- The value of `vis[pb - 1]` (which was previously `vis[pb - 1] = 1`) is now `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1] = 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`) remain unchanged.
