### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program initializes two empty lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the sequence of scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions in the permutation to avoid infinite loops.

2. **Path Traversal:**
   - The program correctly traverses the permutation starting from Bodya's position `pb` and appends the corresponding scores from `a` to `pathb` until it encounters a previously visited position.
   - Similarly, it traverses the permutation starting from Sasha's position `ps` and appends the corresponding scores from `a` to `paths` until it encounters a previously visited position.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score calculation logic in the original program is incorrect. The program should consider the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation for each turn.
   - The current logic calculates the score as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, which is not correct. This formula incorrectly assumes that the player will always move to the next position and does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position.
   - The corrected program uses a more accurate approach to calculate the score by identifying cycles in the permutation and summing the scores accordingly.

4. **Infinite Loop Prevention:**
   - The program uses a `vis` list to prevent infinite loops, which is correct.
   - However, it resets the `vis` list for Sasha's path, which is unnecessary and can be optimized. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the program, but it can be improved for efficiency.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start, k):
            path = []
            vis = [0] * n
            curr = start
            while not vis[curr - 1]:
                vis[curr - 1] = 1
                path.append(a[curr - 1])
                curr = p[curr - 1]
            
            cycle_start = path.index(a[curr - 1])
            cycle_length = len(path) - cycle_start
            cycle_sum = sum(path[cycle_start:])
            pre_cycle_sum = sum(path[:cycle_start])
            
            if k < cycle_start:
                return sum(path[:k])
            else:
                full_cycles = (k - cycle_start) // cycle_length
                remaining_turns = (k - cycle_start) % cycle_length
                return pre_cycle_sum + full_cycles * cycle_sum + sum(path[cycle_start:cycle_start + remaining_turns])
        
        score_bodya = calculate_score(pb, k)
        score_sasha = calculate_score(ps, k)
        
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `calculate_score`:**
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position and the number of turns `k`.
   - It first traverses the permutation to find the path and the cycle.
   - It then calculates the score for the pre-cycle part and the full cycles, and finally adds the score for the remaining turns.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main function reads the input and calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Correctness:
- The original program's score calculation logic is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect results.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should provide the correct output for the given problem.

Final: **False**
