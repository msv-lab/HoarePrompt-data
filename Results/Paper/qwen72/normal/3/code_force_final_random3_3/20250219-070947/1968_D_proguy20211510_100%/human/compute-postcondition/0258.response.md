Output State: **`i` is `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`, `curr` is the last computed value of `preb + pathb[min(len(pathb), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(pathb), k) - 1))`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`. This means `i` will be the index of the last element in `pathb` that was processed, or `k - 1` if `k` is less than the length of `pathb`.
- **`preb`**: `preb` will be the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`. This is because `preb` is updated by adding each element of `pathb` in each iteration of the loop.
- **`curr`**: `curr` will be the last computed value of `preb + pathb[min(len(pathb), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(pathb), k) - 1))`. This value is calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
- **`resb`**: `resb` will be the maximum value of `curr` that was computed during the loop. This is because `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr` in each iteration.
