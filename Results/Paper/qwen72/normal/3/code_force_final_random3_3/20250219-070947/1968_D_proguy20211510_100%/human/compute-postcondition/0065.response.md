Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing at least three integers, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `ps` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks, `resb` is now the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is now equal to `pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 2, `curr` is now equal to `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)` if `k` is greater than or equal to 3. If `k` is less than 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is provided, and the code snippet updates the value of `curr`.
- `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.
- Given that `i` is 2, `curr` becomes `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`.
- If `k` is less than 3, the loop or if statement breaks, and no further updates are made to `curr`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
