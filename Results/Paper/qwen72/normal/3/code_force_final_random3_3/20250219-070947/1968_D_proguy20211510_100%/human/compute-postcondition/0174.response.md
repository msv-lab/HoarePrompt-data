Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] * k`, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`. If `k` is less than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 1.
- `paths` remains a list with at least 1 element.
- `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[0]`.
- `ress` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] * k`.
- `curr` is assigned the value `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`.
- If `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
