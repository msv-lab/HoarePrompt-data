The code snippet `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` from the list `a` to the list `pathb`.

Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `pathb` is initially a list containing the element `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`.
- `a[pb - 1]` is the element at index `pb - 1` in the list `a`.
- After appending `a[pb - 1]` to `pathb`, `pathb` will now contain two elements: the initial element `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` and the new element `a[pb - 1]`.

The other variables (`vis`, `i`, `pres`, `ress`, `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `paths`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` which is 1, `i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list. If the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
