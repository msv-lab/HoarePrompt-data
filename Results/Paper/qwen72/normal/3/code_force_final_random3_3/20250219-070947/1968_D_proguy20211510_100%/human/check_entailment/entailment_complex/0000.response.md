Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the "Permutation game" problem by simulating the game for Bodya and Sasha and determining the winner based on their scores after `k` turns. Let's break down the program to check its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the path for Bodya and Sasha by following the rules of the game. It keeps track of the positions visited and the scores accumulated.
   - It uses a `vis` list to mark visited positions to avoid infinite loops in case of cycles in the permutation.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the scores they can accumulate at each step.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for up to `k` turns, updating the scores accordingly.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Variable Naming and Initialization**:
   - The variables `YES` and `NO` are initialized but never used. This is not an error but is unnecessary.
   - The variable `alpha` is also initialized but never used. This is not an error but is unnecessary.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - The path calculation for both players is correct. It correctly follows the permutation and marks visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - The paths are stored in `pathb` and `paths` lists, which are used to calculate the scores.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation logic is correct. It correctly accumulates the scores and considers the maximum possible score for each player after `k` turns.
   - The use of `preb` and `pres` to keep track of the cumulative scores is appropriate.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The comparison of the final scores and the output of the result is correct.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The input reading is done correctly, but it could be more robust by handling potential input errors (e.g., invalid input types or out-of-bounds values).

2. **Cycle Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles cycles in the permutation by breaking the loop when a position is visited again. This ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient for the given constraints, as it processes each test case in linear time relative to the length of the permutation.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It handles the input, path calculation, score calculation, and comparison correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
