Output State: **`pathb` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[2]`, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the value of `curr`.
- The value of `curr` is `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`.
- The value of `preb` is `preb + pathb[2]`.
- The value of `resb` is now the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`.
- The values of `pathb`, `i`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop (if `k` is less than 3) remain unchanged.
