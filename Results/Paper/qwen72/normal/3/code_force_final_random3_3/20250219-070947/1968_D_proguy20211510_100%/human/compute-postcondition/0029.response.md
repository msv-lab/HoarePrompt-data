Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, and `pb` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks.**

Explanation:
- The code `vis[ps - 1] = 1` sets the element at index `ps - 1` in the list `vis` to 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The list `vis` now has a 1 at the index `ps - 1`, while all other elements remain 0.
