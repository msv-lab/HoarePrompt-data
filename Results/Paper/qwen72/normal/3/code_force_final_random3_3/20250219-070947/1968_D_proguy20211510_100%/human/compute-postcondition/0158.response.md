Output State: **`pathb` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `pathb`, `i`, `curr`, `preb`, and `resb` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
