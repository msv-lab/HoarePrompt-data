The loop head in this case is `while True:` which means the loop will always execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any state variables and is always `True`, we do not need to adjust any state variables for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing one element which is `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
