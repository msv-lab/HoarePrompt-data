You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user to simulate a game between Bodya and Sasha. It takes no explicit parameters but reads `n` (length of the permutation), `k` (number of turns), `P_B` (Bodya's starting position), `P_S` (Sasha's starting position), `p` (a permutation of length `n`), and `a` (an array of length `n` with positive integers). The function calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their paths through the permutation and the values in the array `a`. After `k` turns, it prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program initializes two empty lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the sequence of scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions in the permutation to avoid infinite loops.

2. **Path Traversal:**
   - The program traverses the permutation starting from Bodya's position `pb` and appends the corresponding scores from `a` to `pathb` until it encounters a previously visited position.
   - Similarly, it traverses the permutation starting from Sasha's position `ps` and appends the corresponding scores from `a` to `paths` until it encounters a previously visited position.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the paths and calculates the score for each turn, considering the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The score for each turn is calculated as the sum of the previous score and the current score multiplied by the remaining number of turns.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if both scores are equal.

### Issues:
1. **Variable Names:**
   - The variables `YES` and `NO` are defined but not used in the program. These can be removed as they are unnecessary.
   - The variable `alpha` is defined but not used. This can also be removed.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score calculation logic is incorrect. The program should consider the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation for each turn.
   - The current logic calculates the score as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, which is not correct. It should calculate the score for each turn and then determine the maximum possible score.

3. **Infinite Loop Prevention:**
   - The program uses a `vis` list to prevent infinite loops, which is correct. However, it resets the `vis` list for Sasha's path, which is unnecessary and can be optimized.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start, k):
            path = []
            vis = [0] * n
            curr = start
            while not vis[curr - 1]:
                vis[curr - 1] = 1
                path.append(a[curr - 1])
                curr = p[curr - 1]
            
            cycle_start = path.index(a[curr - 1])
            cycle_length = len(path) - cycle_start
            cycle_sum = sum(path[cycle_start:])
            pre_cycle_sum = sum(path[:cycle_start])
            
            if k < cycle_start:
                return sum(path[:k])
            else:
                full_cycles = (k - cycle_start) // cycle_length
                remaining_turns = (k - cycle_start) % cycle_length
                return pre_cycle_sum + full_cycles * cycle_sum + sum(path[cycle_start:cycle_start + remaining_turns])
        
        score_bodya = calculate_score(pb, k)
        score_sasha = calculate_score(ps, k)
        
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `calculate_score`:**
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position and the number of turns `k`.
   - It first traverses the permutation to find the path and the cycle.
   - It then calculates the score for the pre-cycle part and the full cycles, and finally adds the score for the remaining turns.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main function reads the input and calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has issues with the score calculation logic, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should provide the correct output for the given problem.
