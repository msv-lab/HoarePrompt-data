Output State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `P_B` and `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 <= `P_B`, `P_S` <= `n`, `p` is a permutation of length `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `a` is an array of length `n` containing positive integers, each between 1 and 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.** 

The code assigns the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to the variable `alpha`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
