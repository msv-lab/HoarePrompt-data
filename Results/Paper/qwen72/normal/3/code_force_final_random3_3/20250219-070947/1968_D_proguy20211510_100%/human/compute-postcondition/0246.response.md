The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `pathb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `pathb` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `pathb` is a list containing at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pathb` must still have at least one more element (i.e., at least 2 elements in total).

State: **`i` is 1, `pathb` is a list containing at least two elements, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[0]`, if `k` is less than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `resb` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr`**
