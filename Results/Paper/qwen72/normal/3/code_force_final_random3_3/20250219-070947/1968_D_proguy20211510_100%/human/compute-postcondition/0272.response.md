The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `paths`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `paths`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `paths` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `paths` must still have at least two elements, which means it must have at least three elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least three elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[2]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `curr`. If `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
