Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n`.**

The value of `rsum` is calculated as `n - i`, where `i` is 0, so `rsum` is equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
