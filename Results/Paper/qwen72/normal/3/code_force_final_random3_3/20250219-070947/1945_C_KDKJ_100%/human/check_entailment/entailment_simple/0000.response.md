### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, `func_1()` is called, which reads the integer `n` and the string `a` of length `n`.

2. **Cumulative Counts:**
   - The function `func_1()` initializes a list `S` to store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates over the string `a` and updates the cumulative counts in `S`. This ensures that `S[i]` contains the number of '0's and '1's up to the i-th house.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program then iterates over all possible positions `i` where the road can be laid (from 0 to n).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied. If not, it continues to the next position.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village than the current `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the position `ans` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to -1, which is updated to a valid position if any such position exists.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Left Side Condition:** `left * 2 >= lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
- **Right Side Condition:** `right * 2 >= rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
- **Minimizing Distance to the Middle:** The program correctly uses the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` to find the position closest to the middle of the village.

### Potential Issues:
- **Initial Value of `ans`:** The initial value of `ans` is -1, which is a valid sentinel value to indicate that no position has been found yet. However, it should be ensured that `ans` is updated to a valid position if any such position exists.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases where the road can be laid before the first house (i = 0) or after the last house (i = n).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, calculates the cumulative counts, checks the conditions, and outputs the correct position. There are no obvious logical errors or issues with the implementation.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
