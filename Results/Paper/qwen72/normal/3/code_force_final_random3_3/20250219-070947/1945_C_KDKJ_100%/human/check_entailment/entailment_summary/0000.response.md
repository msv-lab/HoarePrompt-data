Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the input.
   - It then constructs a list `S` where `S[i]` contains the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th index in the string `a`.
   - The function iterates over all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n`) to determine the position of the road that satisfies the given conditions:
     - The number of '0's on the left side of `i` should be at least half the length of the left side.
     - The number of '1's on the right side of `i` should be at least half the length of the right side.
   - It keeps track of the position `ans` that minimizes the absolute difference `|n/2 - i|` while satisfying the conditions.
   - Finally, it prints the position `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, effectively processing each test case as described in the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions.
   - The conditions for the number of '0's and '1's on each side are checked using the cumulative counts stored in `S`.
   - The function ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible by minimizing `|n/2 - i|`.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is sound and `func_2` handles the test cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
