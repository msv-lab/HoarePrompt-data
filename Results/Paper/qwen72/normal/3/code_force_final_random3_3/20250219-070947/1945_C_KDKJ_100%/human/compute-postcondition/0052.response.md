Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is 2, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
