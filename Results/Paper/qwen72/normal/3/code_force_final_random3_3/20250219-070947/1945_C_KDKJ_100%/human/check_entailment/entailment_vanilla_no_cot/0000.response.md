Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is handled correctly by `func_2` which calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: In `func_1`, the program calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones in the string `a`. This is done using a list `S` where each element is a pair `[x, y]` representing the number of zeros and ones up to that point in the string. This is a correct and efficient way to handle the cumulative counts.

3. **Condition Checking**: The program iterates through all possible positions to place the road (from 0 to n). For each position `i`, it checks:
   - The number of zeros on the left side should be at least half of the left side length.
   - The number of ones on the right side should be at least half of the right side length.
   This is done using the conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum`.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program keeps track of the position `i` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village. This is done by comparing `abs(n / 2 - i)` with `abs(n / 2 - ans)` and updating `ans` accordingly.

5. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position for each test case, which is the correct output format.

The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
