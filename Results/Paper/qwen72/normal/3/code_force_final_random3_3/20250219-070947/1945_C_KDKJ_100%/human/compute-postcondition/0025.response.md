To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be 0 or greater. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `n` should be a non-negative integer.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters.
- `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists.
- `ans` is -1.

We need to ensure that `n` is non-negative and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1**
