Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing two sublists `[0, 0]` and `[x, y]`, `s` is the second character in the string `a`, `x` is the value of the second element in the second sublist of `S`, `y` is the value of the third element in the second sublist of `S`.**

In natural language: The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. `S` is still a list containing two sublists, where the first sublist is `[0, 0]` and the second sublist is `[x, y]`. The variable `s` is still the second character of the string `a`. The variables `x` and `y` are now updated to the values of the second and third elements, respectively, in the second sublist of `S`. If `s` was '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0. Otherwise, `x` is 0 and `y` is 1.
