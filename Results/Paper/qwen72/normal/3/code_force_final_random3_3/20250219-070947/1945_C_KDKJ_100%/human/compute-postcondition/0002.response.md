The only object in the loop head is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must have been greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, the user must input a new value for `int(input())` that is greater than 0.

However, since `int(input())` is a function call that prompts the user for input each time the loop condition is evaluated, it is not a variable that retains its state between iterations. Therefore, the state of `int(input())` is not adjusted; instead, it is re-evaluated at the start of each iteration.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called.**
