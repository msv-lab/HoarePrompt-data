### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - This part is correctly implemented and matches the problem description.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program constructs a prefix sum array `S` where `S[i][0]` is the number of residents who want to live on the left side (i.e., the number of '0's) up to the i-th house, and `S[i][1]` is the number of residents who want to live on the right side (i.e., the number of '1's) up to the i-th house.
   - This is done by iterating through the string `a` and updating the counts accordingly.
   - The prefix sum array is correctly constructed, allowing the program to efficiently calculate the number of '0's and '1's on both sides of any potential road position.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The program iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be laid (from 0 to n).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of residents on the left side (`left`) and the number of residents on the right side (`right`).
   - It also calculates the total number of houses on the left side (`lsum`) and the total number of houses on the right side (`rsum`).
   - The program checks if the condition for at least half of the residents on each side being satisfied is met:
     - `left * 2 >= lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left side.
     - `right * 2 >= rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right side.
   - If both conditions are met, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position `ans`. If so, it updates `ans`.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to -1, which is a valid sentinel value to ensure that the first valid position is always chosen.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the road can be laid before the first house (position 0) or after the last house (position n).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case.
   - This part is correctly implemented and matches the problem description.

5. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the optimal position is chosen based on the given conditions. The prefix sum array and the conditions for satisfaction are correctly implemented, and the program correctly processes multiple test cases.

Final: **True**
