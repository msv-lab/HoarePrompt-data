To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters.
   - `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists.
   - `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` for each iteration.

2. **Understanding `i` and `ans`:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`, which means `i` is always one more than the length of the string `a`.
   - `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while also satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.

3. **Conditions for `ans`:**
   - The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` must be satisfied for each iteration.
   - `left` and `right` are not explicitly defined, but they are likely to be related to the sublists in `S` and the values `lsum` and `rsum`.

4. **Minimizing the Absolute Difference:**
   - The goal is to find the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`.
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is `|n / 2 - (n + 1)|`.

5. **Calculating the Absolute Difference:**
   - The absolute difference is `|n / 2 - (n + 1)| = |n / 2 - n - 1| = |(n / 2) - n - 1| = |(n / 2) - n - 1| = |-(n / 2) - 1| = |(n / 2) + 1|`.
   - This value is minimized when `n` is as close to 0 as possible, but since `n` is a non-negative integer, the smallest value `n` can take is 0.

6. **Satisfying the Conditions:**
   - The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` must be satisfied.
   - Without knowing the exact values of `left`, `right`, `lsum`, and `rsum`, we can't determine the exact value of `ans` numerically. However, we know that `ans` is the value of `i` that satisfies these conditions and minimizes the absolute difference.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference while satisfying the conditions, `ans` will be `n + 1` if the conditions are met for `i = n + 1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the value of `i` that satisfies the conditions and minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`.

Output: **n + 1 (where n is the length of the input string `a` and `i` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`)**
