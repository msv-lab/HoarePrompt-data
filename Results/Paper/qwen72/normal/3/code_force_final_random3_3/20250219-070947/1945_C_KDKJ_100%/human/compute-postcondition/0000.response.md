To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `_` is a placeholder variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
