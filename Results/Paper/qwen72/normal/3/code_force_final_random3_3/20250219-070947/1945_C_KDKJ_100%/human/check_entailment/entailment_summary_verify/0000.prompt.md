You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer from the user input, and calls the function `func_1` that many times. After the function concludes, `func_1` has been called the number of times specified by the user input integer.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal position to lay the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones for the input string `a`. This is stored in the list `S`, where `S[i]` contains the number of zeros and ones up to the i-th house.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Positions**: The program iterates over all possible positions to lay the road, from 0 to n (inclusive). For each position `i`, it calculates:
   - `left`: The number of zeros on the left side of the road.
   - `lsum`: The total number of houses on the left side of the road.
   - `right`: The number of ones on the right side of the road.
   - `rsum`: The total number of houses on the right side of the road.

3. **Check Conditions**: For each position `i`, the program checks if the conditions for at least half of the residents on each side being satisfied are met:
   - `left * 2 < lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left side.
   - `right * 2 < rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right side.

4. **Update Answer**: If the conditions are met, the program updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position.

5. **Output the Result**: After iterating through all possible positions, the program prints the optimal position `ans`.

The program handles all edge cases, including when the road is laid before the first house (position 0) and after the last house (position n). It also correctly handles the case where multiple positions are equally optimal by choosing the smaller one. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
