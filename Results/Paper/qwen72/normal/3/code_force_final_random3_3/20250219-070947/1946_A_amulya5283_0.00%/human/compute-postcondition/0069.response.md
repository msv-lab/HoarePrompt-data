The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The integer `n` represents the number of elements in the list, and each element in the list is an integer. The function returns a list `results` containing the number of operations required for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` containing the number of operations required for each test case.**
