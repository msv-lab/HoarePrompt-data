The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[0]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[0]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements that were initially smaller than or equal to `current_median` have been incremented by 1, and `operations` is the number of elements in the heap that were initially smaller than or equal to `current_median`.**
