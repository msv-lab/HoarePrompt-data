Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements that were initially smaller than or equal to `current_median` have been incremented by 1, and `operations` is the number of elements in the heap that were initially smaller than or equal to `current_median`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_median = arr[median_index]` reassigns the value of `current_median` to be the element at the `median_index` of the sorted `arr`.
- The initial state already specifies that `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, so this assignment does not change the value of `current_median`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
