Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, `operations` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `operations = 0` resets the value of `operations` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
