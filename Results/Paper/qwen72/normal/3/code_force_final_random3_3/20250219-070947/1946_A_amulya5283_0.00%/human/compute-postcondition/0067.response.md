Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the number of operations required for each test case, `n` is the first element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the last test case in `test_cases` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are now greater than `current_median`, and `operations` is the number of times the loop executed for the last test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all `t` iterations:
- The index `i` is at the last test case, which is `t - 1`.
- The `results` list contains the number of operations required to make all elements in the heap greater than the median for each of the `t` test cases.
- The variables `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` are updated to reflect the state of the last test case processed by the loop. Specifically:
  - `n` is the number of elements in the last test case.
  - `arr` is the list of elements from the last test case, sorted in ascending order.
  - `median_index` is the index of the median element in the sorted `arr`.
  - `current_median` is the median element of the sorted `arr`.
  - `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`, and all elements in the heap are now greater than `current_median`.
  - `operations` is the number of times the loop incremented elements in the heap for the last test case.
