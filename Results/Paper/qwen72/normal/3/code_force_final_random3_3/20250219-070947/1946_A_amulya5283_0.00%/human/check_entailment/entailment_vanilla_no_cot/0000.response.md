Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the heap is used and the condition for the while loop.

1. **Heap Initialization and Usage**:
   - The heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is correct for the purpose of finding the smallest element that is greater than or equal to the current median.
   - However, the while loop condition `while heap[0] <= current_median:` is incorrect. The goal is to increase the median, so the loop should continue until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median, not just equal to it.

2. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index is calculated correctly as `median_index = n // 2`.
   - The current median is correctly identified as `current_median = arr[median_index]`.

3. **Operations Calculation**:
   - The program correctly increments the smallest element in the heap and counts the operations.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the smallest element in the heap is already greater than the current median. The loop should stop as soon as the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        (n, arr) = test_cases[i]
        arr.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        operations = 0
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
            current_median = smallest + 1  # Update current median to the new value
        results.append(operations)
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        test_cases.append((n, arr))
        index += 1 + n
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Update Current Median**: After incrementing the smallest element in the heap, the current median should be updated to the new value of the smallest element plus one. This ensures that the loop stops when the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
- **Heap Operations**: The heap is used to efficiently find and increment the smallest element that is greater than or equal to the current median.

With these changes, the program should correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median for each test case.
