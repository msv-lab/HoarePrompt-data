Output State: **`heap[0]` is now the next smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is equal to the previous `heap[0]`, `heap` has the same number of elements as before the execution of the code, `operations` is increased by 3, and `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `arr[median_index] + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `operations` is incremented by 1, so `operations` is now increased by 3 in total.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
