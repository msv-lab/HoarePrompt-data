t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, and the second element is a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
