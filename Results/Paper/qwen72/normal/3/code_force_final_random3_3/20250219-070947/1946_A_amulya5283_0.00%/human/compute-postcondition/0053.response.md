To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `i` is 2
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`
- `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`
- `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted in ascending order
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is updated to `arr[median_index]` (the new median after sorting)
- `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, and `heap` is now a min-heap
- `operations` is 0

### Loop Condition:
```
while heap[0] <= current_median:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the min-heap, which is the first element of the list `heap`.
- `current_median` is the middle element of the sorted list `arr`.

### Steps to Ensure the Loop Executes:
1. **Check the Initial Values:**
   - `heap` is a min-heap containing elements from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`.
   - `current_median` is the element at `arr[median_index]`.

2. **Determine the Condition:**
   - Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap.
   - For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The initial state already ensures that `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, which is `arr[median_index]`.
   - Therefore, `heap[0]` is equal to `current_median` by definition.

### Conclusion:
- The loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is already satisfied with the initial state provided.
- No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is updated to `arr[median_index]` (the new median after sorting), `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, and `heap` is now a min-heap, `operations` is 0**
