The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2**
