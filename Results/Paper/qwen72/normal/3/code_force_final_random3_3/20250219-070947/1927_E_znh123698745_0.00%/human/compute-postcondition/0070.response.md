Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` has been updated by appending the integer at the position `a[-1]` in `array`, `a[-1]` is now `a[-1] - 1`.**

The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `a[-1]` is now one less than its previous value.
