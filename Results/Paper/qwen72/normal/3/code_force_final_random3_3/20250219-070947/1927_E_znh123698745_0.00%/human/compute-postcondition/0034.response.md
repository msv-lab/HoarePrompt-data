Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`.
- `a[-1]` is -1, so `array[a[-1]]` is `array[-1]`, which is the last element of `array`.
- Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the last element `array[-1]` is `n`.
- Therefore, `answer` now contains the integers 1 and `n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
