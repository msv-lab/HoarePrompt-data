Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
2. `_` is 2.
3. `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1.
4. `k` is an input positive integer.
5. `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
6. `i` is `n-1`.
7. `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1.
8. `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*answer)
```

### Analysis:
- **`n`**: This is an input positive integer greater than 1. For example, if `n` is 5, then `n` is 5.
- **`array`**: This is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `n` is 5, then `array` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- **`i`**: This is `n-1`. If `n` is 5, then `i` is 4.
- **`answer`**: This is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1. If `n` is 5, then `answer` will be `[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]`.

### Explanation:
- The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces.
- The `answer` list is constructed such that it contains the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating order starting with 1. This means it will first include all the odd numbers from 1 to `n`, followed by all the even numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n` is 5, then `answer` will be `[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]`.
- If `n` is 6, then `answer` will be `[1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list in the order they are stored, separated by spaces. The `answer` list contains the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1.

Output: **1 3 5 ... 2 4 6 (where the list contains all odd numbers from 1 to n followed by all even numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces)**

This output format will vary based on the value of `n`, but it will always follow the pattern described.
