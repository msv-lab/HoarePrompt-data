Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation as described in the problem statement. The program constructs a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements, but it does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, let's analyze a simple example from the problem statement:

### Example Test Case:
```
n = 3, k = 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
1 3 2
```

### Program's Output:
The program will output:
```
1 3 2
```

### Analysis:
- The program constructs the permutation `[1, 3, 2]`.
- The sums of continuous segments of length 2 are:
  - `s_1 = p_1 + p_2 = 1 + 3 = 4`
  - `s_2 = p_2 + p_3 = 3 + 2 = 5`

- The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `5 - 4 = 1`, which satisfies the k-level condition.

However, for a different test case, the program may not produce the correct result. For example:

### Example Test Case:
```
n = 10, k = 4
```

### Expected Output:
```
1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
```

### Program's Output:
The program will output:
```
1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6
```

### Analysis:
- The program constructs the permutation `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`.
- The sums of continuous segments of length 4 are:
  - `s_1 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 1 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 22`
  - `s_2 = p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 10 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 24`
  - `s_3 = p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 2 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 22`
  - `s_4 = p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 = 9 + 3 + 8 + 4 = 24`
  - `s_5 = p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 = 3 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 22`
  - `s_6 = p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 8 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 24`
  - `s_7 = p_7 + p_8 + p_9 + p_10 = 4 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 22`

- The maximum sum is 24, and the minimum sum is 22.
- The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `24 - 22 = 2`, which does not satisfy the k-level condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not always ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.
