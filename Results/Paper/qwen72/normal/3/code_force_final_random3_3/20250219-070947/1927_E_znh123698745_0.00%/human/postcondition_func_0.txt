The function reads `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is even). It then generates a list `answer` containing the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating order starting with 1. Finally, it prints the contents of `answer` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
