The value of `a[-1]` is decremented by 1. Since `a[-1]` is the last element in the list `array`, which is `n`, the value of `n` is now `n - 1`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list that now includes the integer `n - 1` at the index `a[-1]` in `array`.**
