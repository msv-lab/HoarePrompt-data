The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**
