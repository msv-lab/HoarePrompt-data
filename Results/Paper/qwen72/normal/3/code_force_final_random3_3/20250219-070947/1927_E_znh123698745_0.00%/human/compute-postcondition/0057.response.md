Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

The code snippet `array = list(range(1, n + 1))` reassigns the variable `array` to a new list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged.
