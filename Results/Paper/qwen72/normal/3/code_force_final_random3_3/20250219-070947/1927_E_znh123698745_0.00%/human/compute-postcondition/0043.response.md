Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or the first element of `array`, and `array[a[0]]`, and `a` is a list containing either the integers 1 and -2 or the integers 2 and -1, depending on whether `(-1)` is in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`.
- The value of `a[0]` is either 1 or 2, depending on the initial state of `a`.
- If `a[0]` is 1, then `array[a[0]]` is `array[1]`, which is the second element of `array`.
- If `a[0]` is 2, then `array[a[0]]` is `array[2]`, which is the third element of `array`.
- The list `answer` now contains the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or the first element of `array`, and the value of `array[a[0]]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `array`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
