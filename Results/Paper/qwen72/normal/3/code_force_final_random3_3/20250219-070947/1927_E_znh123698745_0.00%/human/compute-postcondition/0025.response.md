Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list that alternates between the first and last elements of `array` until all elements from 1 to `n` are included, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`_`**: Remains 0.
- **`n`**: Must be a positive integer greater than 1, as the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`k`**: Remains a positive integer.
- **`array`**: Remains a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, as the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`answer`**: The list `answer` will contain all integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern. Specifically, it will start with 1, then append the last element of `array`, then the second element of `array`, then the second-to-last element of `array`, and so on until all elements from 1 to `n` are included.
- **`a`**: The list `a` will be modified such that `a[0]` is `n` and `a[-1]` is `-n`. This is because the loop alternates between incrementing `a[0]` and decrementing `a[-1]` until all elements are appended to `answer`.
