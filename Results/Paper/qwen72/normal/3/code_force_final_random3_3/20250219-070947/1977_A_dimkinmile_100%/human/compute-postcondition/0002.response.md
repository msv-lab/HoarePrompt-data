Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
- The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are assigned values from a space-separated string of two integers.
- The difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, i.e., (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement will always print the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of `n` and `m` as long as the conditions specified in the initial state are met. The conditions ensure that `n` and `m` are valid integers and that their difference is even and non-negative.

Output: **Yes**
