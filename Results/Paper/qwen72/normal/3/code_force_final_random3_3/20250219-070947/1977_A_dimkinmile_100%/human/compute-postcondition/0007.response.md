Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from user input, where each integer is between 1 and 100. The function then checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". The function does not handle multiple test cases or return a list of results. **
