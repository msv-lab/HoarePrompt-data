Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the parameters as described. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers n and m.
