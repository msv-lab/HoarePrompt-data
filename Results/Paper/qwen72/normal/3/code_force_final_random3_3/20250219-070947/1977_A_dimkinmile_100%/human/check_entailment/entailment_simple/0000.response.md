### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.
   - The program then checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative using the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)`.

3. **Condition Explanation**:
   - **Even Difference**: The difference `n - m` being even means that the number of moves to add or remove cubes can be balanced in such a way that the final number of cubes is `m`. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and an even number of moves can be split into pairs of moves that cancel each other out.
   - **Non-negative Difference**: The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the desired number of cubes, which is necessary because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition is met, the program prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is not met, the program prints "No".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are equal (since `n - m` would be 0, which is even and non-negative).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `m` (since `n - m` would be negative, and the condition would not be met).

6. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly iterates over the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The conditions and the logic are sound and handle all the specified constraints and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
