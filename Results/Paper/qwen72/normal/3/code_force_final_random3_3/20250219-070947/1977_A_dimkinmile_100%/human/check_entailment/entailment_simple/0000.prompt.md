Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

# Annotated Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, where the input is a space-separated string of two integers. If the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative (i.e., (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0), the function proceeds with this condition. Otherwise, the difference between `n` and `m` is either not divisible by 2 or `n - m` is less than 0, and the function handles this alternative condition.
