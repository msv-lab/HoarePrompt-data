Based on the initial state provided:

- The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
- The function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are assigned values from a space-separated string of two integers.
- The difference between `n` and `m` is either not divisible by 2 or `n - m` is less than 0.

Given the `print('No')` statement, the output is a constant string 'No'. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement, as it simply prints a fixed string.

Output: **No**
