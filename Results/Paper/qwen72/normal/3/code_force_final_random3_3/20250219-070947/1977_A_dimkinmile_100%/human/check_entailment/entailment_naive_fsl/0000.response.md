Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` because:

1. **`n >= m`**: Nikita can only have `m` cubes if he has made at least `m` moves to add those cubes.
2. **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: The difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even because each move that adds a cube must be balanced by a move that removes a cube to maintain the final count of `m` cubes.

The current condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient because it does not ensure that the number of moves is enough to reach `m` cubes. For example, if `n = 1` and `m = 2`, the program will incorrectly output "No" because `n - m` is not non-negative, even though it should be "No" because `n` is less than `m`.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
