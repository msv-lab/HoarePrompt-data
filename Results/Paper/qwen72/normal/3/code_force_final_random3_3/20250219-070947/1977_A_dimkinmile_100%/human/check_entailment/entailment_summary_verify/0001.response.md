### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - The program checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
   - If `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the number of cubes added or removed must be even to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes, which is necessary to build the tower.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than `m` (which would make it impossible to build the tower).
   - It also handles the case where `n` is exactly `m` (which is possible by adding one cube `m` times).

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly states that `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, checks the conditions, and prints the result.
   - The function does not handle multiple test cases or return a list of results, but this is not required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions used are accurate and cover all necessary cases. The function summary aligns with the program's behavior, and the program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
