Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is either unchanged or set to `mid`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- The value of `h` remains either unchanged or set to `mid`, as specified in the initial state.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
- `f` is still the next element in `F`.
- `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, but the specific value of `mid` is not known without the actual values of `l` and `h`.
- `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, using the new value of `mid`.
- `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, using the new value of `mid`.
