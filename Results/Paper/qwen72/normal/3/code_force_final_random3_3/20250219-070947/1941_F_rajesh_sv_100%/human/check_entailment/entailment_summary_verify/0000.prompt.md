You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a non-negative integer value from `func_3` and uses this value to call `func_6` the same number of times. The function does not return any value, and its primary purpose is to execute `func_6` a specific number of times determined by the result of `func_3`. After the function concludes, `func_6` has been called `testcases` times, where `testcases` is a non-negative integer.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function 1 and Function 2**: The `func_1` and `wrapper` functions are not used in the program, and they do not seem to serve any purpose related to the problem. This is unnecessary and could be a mistake.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**: The `func_7` function is supposed to handle multiple test cases, but it does not properly initialize or reset variables between test cases. This could lead to incorrect results if the state from one test case affects the next.

3. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_6` is not correctly implemented. The program uses `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` to find the appropriate position for the new problem complexity, but the logic for updating `ans` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if l == h` is not sufficient to ensure that the minimum imbalance is correctly calculated. The program should also consider the cases where the new complexity can be inserted between existing elements or at the boundaries.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the new problem complexity is outside the range of the existing complexities (i.e., less than `A[0]` or greater than `A[n-1]`). In such cases, the imbalance should be recalculated considering the new boundary conditions.

To ensure the program is correct, it should be revised to address these issues.
