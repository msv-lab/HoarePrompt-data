Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to the previous `max_diff`, and `index` is 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains the same, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]` if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, and `index` is 1 if `diff` > `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is None.***
