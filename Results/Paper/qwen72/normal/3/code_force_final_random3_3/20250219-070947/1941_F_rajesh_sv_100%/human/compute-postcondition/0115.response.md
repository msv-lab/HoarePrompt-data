Postcondition: **The loop has finished executing, and the final values of `l` and `h` are such that `l` is no longer less than `h`. If `l` is equal to `h`, the variable `ans` has been updated to the minimum value of the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` after each iteration, and `mid` is the last computed value of `l + (h - l) // 2`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.**
