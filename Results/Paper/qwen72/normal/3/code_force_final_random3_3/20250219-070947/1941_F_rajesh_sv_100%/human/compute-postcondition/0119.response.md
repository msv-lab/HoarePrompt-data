Functionality: ** The function `func_6` processes three lists `A`, `D`, and `F` to find the minimum value of the maximum difference between two segments of the list `A` after applying a transformation based on elements in `F` and `D`. It first identifies the largest and second-largest differences between consecutive elements in `A`. Then, it iterates over each element in `F`, using binary search on `D` to find the optimal transformation that minimizes the maximum difference. Finally, it prints the maximum of this minimized difference and the second-largest difference found in `A`. The function does not return any value. **
