Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` remains the same, `h` is updated to `mid`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. All other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged. `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation:
- `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively.
- `mid` is still `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `f` remains the next element in `F`.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `h` is updated to the value of `mid`.
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute one more time is still valid.
