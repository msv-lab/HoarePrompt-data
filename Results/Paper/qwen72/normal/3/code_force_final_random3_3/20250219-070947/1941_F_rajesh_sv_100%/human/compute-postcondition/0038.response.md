To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop head: `l < h`.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`
- `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1]
- `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`
- `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9 and `k` must be greater than 0
- `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`
- `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`
- `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs
- `left` is `A[index - 1]`
- `right` is `A[index]`
- `ans` is equal to `max_diff`
- `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted
- `h` is the index in `D` where the value `right - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, minus 1

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `l < h` must be true for the loop to execute.
- `l` is the index in `D` where `left - F[0]` would be inserted.
- `h` is the index in `D` where `right - F[0]` would be inserted, minus 1.

For `l < h` to be true:
- `left - F[0]` must be less than `right - F[0]` (since `left < right` and `F[0]` is a constant, this is always true).
- The insertion points for `left - F[0]` and `right - F[0]` in `D` must be different, meaning `l` must be less than `h`.

### Adjustments:
- The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `h`.
- To ensure `l < h`, `D` must have at least two elements, and `left - F[0]` and `right - F[0]` must map to different indices in `D`.

Given that `left` and `right` are consecutive elements in `A` and `A` is sorted, `left - F[0]` and `right - F[0]` will always be different. Therefore, the main requirement is that `D` must have at least two elements.

### Conclusion:
- `D` must have at least two elements for `l` and `h` to be different and for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()` and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9 and `k` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, `h` is the index in `D` where the value `right - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, minus 1**
