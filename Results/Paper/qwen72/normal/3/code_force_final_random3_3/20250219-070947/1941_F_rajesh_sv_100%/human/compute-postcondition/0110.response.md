Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `l` remains the same, `h` is updated to `mid`, `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute one more time, and all other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.**
