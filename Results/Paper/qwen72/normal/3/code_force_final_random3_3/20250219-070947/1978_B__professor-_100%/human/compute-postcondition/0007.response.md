Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- `b` is greater than `a` (i.e., \(b > a\)).
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n` (i.e., \(b - a \geq n\)).

### Print Statement:
```
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\).
   - This expression is a formula that calculates an integer value.

2. **Understanding the Formula**:
   - \(2 * b - n + 1\): This part of the formula is a linear combination of `b` and `n`.
   - \((2 * b - n + 1) * n\): This multiplies the result of the linear combination by `n`.
   - \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\): This performs integer division by 2, which means the result is truncated to the nearest whole number towards zero.

3. **Variable Values**:
   - `b` and `a` are input integers with \(b > a\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - The condition \(b - a \geq n\) ensures that `b` is sufficiently larger than `a` to satisfy the inequality.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The formula \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\) will always produce an integer result because of the integer division `// 2`.
   - The exact value of the output depends on the specific values of `b` and `n`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer result of the formula \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\).

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) (where b and n are the input integers such that b > a and b - a â‰¥ n)**
