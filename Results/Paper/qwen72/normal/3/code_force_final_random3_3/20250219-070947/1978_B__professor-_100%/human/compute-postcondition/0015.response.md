To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used in the statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then either `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or `b - a` is less than `n`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Values**:
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `n` is the first value, `a` is the second value, and `b` is the third value.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, then either:
     - `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or
     - `b - a` is less than `n`.

3. **Formula**:
   - The formula used in the `print` statement is: \( \text{int}((2 \times b - n + 1) \times n // 2) \).

4. **Understanding the Formula**:
   - The formula \( (2 \times b - n + 1) \times n // 2 \) is a mathematical expression.
   - The `//` operator performs integer division, which means the result is truncated to the nearest whole number towards zero.
   - The `int` function ensures the final result is an integer.

5. **Evaluating the Formula**:
   - The value of `b` and `n` are crucial for the formula.
   - Since `b` can be either less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a`, we need to consider both cases.

### Case 1: \( b \leq a \)
- In this case, the formula \( (2 \times b - n + 1) \times n // 2 \) will be evaluated with `b` being less than or equal to `a`.
- The exact value of `b` and `n` is not specified, but the formula will still be valid.

### Case 2: \( b > a \)
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then either `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n` or `b - a` is less than `n`.
- The formula \( (2 \times b - n + 1) \times n // 2 \) will be evaluated with `b` being greater than `a`.

### General Output:
- The formula \( (2 \times b - n + 1) \times n // 2 \) will always produce an integer value.
- The exact value depends on the specific values of `b` and `n`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `b` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the formula and the given conditions.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) (where `b` and `n` are integers from the input, and `b` is either less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a` with the conditions specified)**
