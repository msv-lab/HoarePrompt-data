### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price will not be higher.
   - If `b > a`, we need to consider the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)\).
   - This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}\).
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price is \((n - k) \times a\).

4. **Maximizing Profit:**
   - We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.
   - If `b - a < n`, the optimal `k` is `b - a` because selling more buns at the modified price will result in a price lower than `a` for some buns, which is not optimal.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the optimal `k` is `n` because all buns can be sold at a price higher than or equal to `a`.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks if `b <= a`:
     - If true, it prints `n * a` (all buns sold at the usual price).
   - If `b > a`, it checks if `b - a >= n`:
     - If true, it prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\) (all buns sold at the modified price).
   - If `b - a < n`, it prints \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\) (first `b - a` buns sold at the modified price, and the remaining buns sold at the usual price).

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `b <= a` and `b - a >= n`.
   - The formula for the profit when `b - a < n` is also correct.

### Detailed Verification:

- **Case 1: `b <= a`**
  - The program prints `n * a`, which is correct because selling all buns at the usual price is the best option.

- **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
  - The program prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).
  - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - n + 1`.
  - The sum is \(\frac{n \times (b + (b - n + 1))}{2} = \frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2}\), which is correct.

- **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
  - The program prints \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\).
  - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `a + 1`, plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at `a` coins each.
  - The sum of the first `b - a` terms is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b + (b - (b - a) + 1))}{2} = \frac{(b - a) \times (2b - (b - a) + 1)}{2} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
  - The profit from the remaining buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\).
  - Therefore, the total profit is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n - a \times (b - a)\).
  - Simplifying, we get \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n - a \times (b - a) = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n - a \times (b - a) = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\), which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
