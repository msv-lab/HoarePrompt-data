The function `func` seems to be missing the parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and the context, it appears that the function should accept multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function will process each test case and return a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
