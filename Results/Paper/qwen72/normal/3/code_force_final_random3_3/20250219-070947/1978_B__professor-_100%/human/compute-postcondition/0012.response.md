The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop is iterating a fixed number of times, `t` times. The value of `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The loop will execute as long as the current iteration count is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the loop has already executed once. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the iteration count (represented by `_`) must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the current iteration count.

Since the iteration count is not explicitly tracked in the loop head, we can infer that the loop will execute again if `t` is greater than the number of times the loop has already run. After the first iteration, the loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, then either `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or `b - a` is less than `n`.**
