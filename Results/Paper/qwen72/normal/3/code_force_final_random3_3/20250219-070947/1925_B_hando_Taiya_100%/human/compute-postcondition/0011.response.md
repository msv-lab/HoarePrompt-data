To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `x`. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`, where `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 (not changed by the loop head).
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` <= `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `x` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop head.
- `ans` is not part of the loop head and will not be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 1` if `x` is divisible by 1 and `n` <= `x // 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
