Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = max(ans, x // i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x // i`. Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is simply `x`. Therefore, `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value and `x`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The condition that `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`) is still valid, as is the condition that `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.
