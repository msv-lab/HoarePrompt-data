### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires dividing a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals \( x \).
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties will be maximized if all sub-problems have the same difficulty.
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( n \), the optimal solution is to have each sub-problem with difficulty \( \frac{x}{n} \), and the GCD will be \( \frac{x}{n} \).
   - If \( x \) is not divisible by \( n \), we need to find the largest divisor \( d \) of \( x \) such that \( \frac{x}{d} \geq n \). This ensures that we can distribute \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems where each sub-problem has a difficulty that is a multiple of \( d \).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - `func_1` reads \( x \) and \( n \) from the user input.
   - It initializes \( ans \) to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors \( i \) of \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) (using `isqrt(x)` to optimize the loop).
   - For each divisor \( i \):
     - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), it checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{i} \). If so, \( i \) is a valid GCD, and it updates \( ans \) if \( i \) is greater than the current \( ans \).
     - It also checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to \( i \). If so, \( \frac{x}{i} \) is a valid GCD, and it updates \( ans \) if \( \frac{x}{i} \) is greater than the current \( ans \).
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( x \) and checks if they can be used to form \( n \) sub-problems.
   - It ensures that the GCD is maximized by considering both \( i \) and \( \frac{x}{i} \) as potential GCDs.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` optimizes the loop by reducing the number of iterations needed to check divisors.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), the program correctly returns 1.
   - For \( x = 5 \) and \( n = 5 \), the program correctly returns 1, as the only way to divide 5 into 5 sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1.
   - For \( x = 10 \) and \( n = 3 \), the program correctly returns 2, as the optimal division is 4, 2, 4.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently finds the maximum balance (GCD) for the given problem.
