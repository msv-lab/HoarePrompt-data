Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct for the given problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `x` and `n` from the input.

3. **Loop for Divisors**: The program iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`). This is an efficient way to find all divisors of `x` because if `i` is a divisor, then `x // i` is also a divisor.

4. **Checking Conditions**: For each divisor `i`:
   - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

5. **Output**: After processing all divisors, the program prints the maximum balance `ans` for the current test case.

The logic ensures that the maximum possible GCD (balance) is found by considering all divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to form a valid problemset of `n` sub-problems. The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the sub-problems can be formed with the given constraints.

Thus, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
