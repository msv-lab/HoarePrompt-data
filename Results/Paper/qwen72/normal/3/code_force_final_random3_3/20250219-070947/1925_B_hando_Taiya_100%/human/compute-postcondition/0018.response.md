The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of the current value of `ans` and the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `ans` is initially 0. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to 3, as 3 is greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3, `ans` is 3.**
