Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers, `x` and `n`, from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. The function then calculates and prints the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`. The final state of the program includes the printed value of `ans`, which is the maximum divisor of `x` that meets the specified criteria. **
