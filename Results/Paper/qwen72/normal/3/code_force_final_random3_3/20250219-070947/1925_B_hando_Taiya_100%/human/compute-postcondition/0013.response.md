Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2. If `n` <= `x // 2`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 1` if `x` is divisible by 1 and `n` <= `x // 1`. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains 0.***
