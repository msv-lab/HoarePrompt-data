Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1, `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by each subsequent character in `s` up to `s[n//2 - 1]` repeated twice. If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 5, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1] * 2` + `s[2] * 2` + ... + `s[(n // 2 - 1)] * 2`.***
