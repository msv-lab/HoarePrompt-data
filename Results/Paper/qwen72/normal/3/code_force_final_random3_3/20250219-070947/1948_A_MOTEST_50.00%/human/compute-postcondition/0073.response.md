The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n // 2`. If `n // 2` is at least 1, the loop will execute. For `n // 2` to be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2. However, since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 to guarantee the loop executes at least once.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `j` is 0**
