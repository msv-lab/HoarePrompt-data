Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to `x`, `ans`, or `j`. If `n` is even and greater than 1, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than 1, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2 + ... + `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` * 2, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.***
