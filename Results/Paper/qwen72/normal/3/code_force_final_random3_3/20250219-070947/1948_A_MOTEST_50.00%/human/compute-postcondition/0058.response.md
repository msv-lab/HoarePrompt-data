The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by appending `s[x] * 2` to it. Given the initial state, `x` is 2, so `s[x]` refers to `s[2]`. The value of `ans` was initially 'AAA' + 2 * `s[1]`. After appending `s[2] * 2`, `ans` becomes 'AAA' + 2 * `s[1]` + 2 * `s[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer and `n` is odd and must be at least 5, `ans` is 'AAA' + 2 * `s[1]` + 2 * `s[2]`, `x` is 2, `j` is 1.**
