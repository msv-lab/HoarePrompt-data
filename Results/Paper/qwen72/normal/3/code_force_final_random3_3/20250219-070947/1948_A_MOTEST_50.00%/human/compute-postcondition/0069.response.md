Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`.
- The initial state variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is now an input integer, but the specific value is not known until the input is provided. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and the unchanged values of `t` and `i`.
