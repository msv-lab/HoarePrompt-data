Functionality: ** The function `func` does not return a list but instead processes a series of test cases. It accepts a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` constructed as follows: If `n` is even, `ans` is a string where each of the first `n // 2` uppercase letters from the alphabet is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and is followed by each of the next `n // 2 - 1` uppercase letters from the alphabet, each repeated twice. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. **
