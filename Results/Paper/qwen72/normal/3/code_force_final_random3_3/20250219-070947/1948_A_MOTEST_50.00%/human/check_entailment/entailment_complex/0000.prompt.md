Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) is provided.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1` (where `t` is the initial number of test cases), and `n` is an input integer for the last test case. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `x`, `ans`, or `j`. If `n` is even and greater than 1, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than 1, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2 + ... + `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` * 2, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not return a list but instead processes a series of test cases. It accepts a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` constructed as follows: If `n` is even, `ans` is a string where each of the first `n // 2` uppercase letters from the alphabet is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and is followed by each of the next `n // 2 - 1` uppercase letters from the alphabet, each repeated twice. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
