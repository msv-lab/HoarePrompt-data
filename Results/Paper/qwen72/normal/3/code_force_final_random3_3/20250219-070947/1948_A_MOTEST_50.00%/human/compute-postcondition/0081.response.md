Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice and then `s[2]` repeated twice, `x` is 3, `j` is 2**

The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` is now 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
