To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `b` is a list of integers input by the user in the current line.
   - `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `i` exceeds the length of `a` or the loop ends.
   - `i` is the index in `a` where the loop stopped or the length of `a` if the loop completed without `i` exceeding the length of `a`.
   - `j` is `n-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
   - `cnt` is a counter that increments for each element in `b` that is less than the corresponding element in `a`.
   - The loop iterates through the elements of `a` and `b` up to the length of `a`.

3. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop will stop either when `i` exceeds the length of `a` or when all elements have been compared.
   - `cnt` will be the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated count.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `i` exceeds the length of `a` or the loop ends)**
