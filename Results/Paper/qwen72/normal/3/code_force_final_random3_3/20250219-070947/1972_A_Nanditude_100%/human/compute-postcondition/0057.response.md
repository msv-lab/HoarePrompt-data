The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.**
