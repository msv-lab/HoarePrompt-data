Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` for the corresponding `i` values, and `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are not less than `a[i]` up to the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user in the current line, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `i` exceeds the length of `a` or the loop ends, `i` is the index in `a` where the loop stopped or the length of `a` if the loop completed without `i` exceeding the length of `a`, `j` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b` up to `j = n-1`, and `j` is `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
