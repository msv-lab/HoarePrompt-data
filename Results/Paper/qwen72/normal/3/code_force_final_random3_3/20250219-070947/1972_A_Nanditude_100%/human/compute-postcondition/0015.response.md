The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0 if `b[0]` is less than `a[i]`, or 1 otherwise. Therefore, the new value of `i` is 1 if `b[0]` is less than `a[i]`, or 2 otherwise. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 1, if `b[0]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
