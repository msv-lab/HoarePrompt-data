Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input strings. If `b[-2]` is not equal to `>`, the state of `no_path` remains unchanged. If `b[-2]` is equal to `>`, and `n` == 1, the state of `no_path` remains unchanged. If `b[-2]` is equal to `>`, and `n` > 1, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` was True before the if-else block, it remains True. If `no_path` was False before the if-else block, it remains False if any character at an odd index (1, 3, 5, ..., `k-1`) in `a` is not `>`. Otherwise, `no_path` becomes True.***
