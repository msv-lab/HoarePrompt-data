The function `func` accepts three parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`; for each test case, an integer `n` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5` and `n` is even; and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function returns `True` if it is possible to make the arrows in both rows point in the same direction by performing a series of swaps (swapping any two characters in the same row), and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It returns a list of boolean values, where each value indicates whether it is possible to make the arrows in both strings point in the same direction by swapping characters within the same string.**
