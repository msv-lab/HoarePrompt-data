Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `no_path` is a boolean value. If `b[-2]` is not '>', all variables retain their initial values. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` == 1, all variables retain their initial values. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` > 1, and `no_path` is True, all variables retain their initial values. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` > 1, and `no_path` is False, `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n-1` if `n` is odd, or the last odd number less than `n` if `n` is even, and `no_path` remains False if any character at an odd index (from 1 to `k`) in string `a` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains True.***
