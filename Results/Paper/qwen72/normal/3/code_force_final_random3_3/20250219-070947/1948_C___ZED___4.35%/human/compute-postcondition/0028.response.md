Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being `>`, `k` is 1. If the character at index 1 of `a` is not `>`, `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.***
