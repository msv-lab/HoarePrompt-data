Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a robot starting at cell (1, 1) can reach cell (2, n) by following a sequence of moves and arrow directions. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and then must follow the arrow in the current cell.

Let's break down the logic in the provided program:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if the second-to-last arrow in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`). If it is not, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row, so it prints 'NO'.
   - The program then checks if `n` is 1. However, this check is incorrect because the problem states that `n` is always even and at least 2. This check should be removed.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes a boolean variable `no_path` to `True`.
   - It then iterates over the even indices of the second row (`b`) to check if any of the arrows at these positions are not pointing to the right (`>`). If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after the first loop, it resets `no_path` to `True` and iterates over the odd indices of the first row (`a`) to check if any of the arrows at these positions are not pointing to the right (`>`). If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, if `no_path` is `True`, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

**Issues:**
- The check `if n == 1:` is incorrect and should be removed because `n` is always at least 2 and even.
- The logic for determining if the robot can reach (2, n) is flawed. The program checks if all even-indexed arrows in the second row and all odd-indexed arrows in the first row are pointing to the right. However, this does not correctly capture the conditions under which the robot can reach (2, n).

**Correct Logic:**
- The robot can only move to the second row from the first row if the arrow in the first row points down. However, the problem does not specify arrows pointing up or down, only left or right.
- The robot must be able to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows. This means:
  - The robot must be able to move to the second row at some point.
  - Once in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the right until it reaches the last column.

A correct approach would be:
- Check if the robot can move from (1, 1) to (2, 1) by following the arrow in (1, 1).
- Check if the robot can move from (2, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows in the second row.

Given the current logic, the program does not correctly implement the required checks and can produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
