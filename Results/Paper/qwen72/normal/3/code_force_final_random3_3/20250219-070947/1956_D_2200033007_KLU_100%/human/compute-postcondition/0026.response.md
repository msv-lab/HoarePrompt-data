Output State: **`i` must be at least 1, `start_index` must be a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq \text{start_index} < n\), `j` is initialized to `start_index`, `arr[j]` is now equal to `i`.** 

The value of `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
