You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, where n is the length of the array arr. start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n. arr is a list of integers. res is a list of tuples representing the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. If any element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index (i.e., `arr[start_index + k] != k` for any `k` in the range 0 to `i`), then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index (i.e., `arr[start_index + k] != k` for some `k` in the range 0 to `i`).
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index (i.e., `arr[start_index + k] != k` for some `k` in the range 0 to `i`).
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i - 1 <= n - start_index, `j` is `start_index + i + 1`, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all equal to `i`, `res` includes `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, and `is_already_stairs` is `False`. If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i - 1 <= n - start_index, `j` is `start_index + i + 1`, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i - 1]` are all equal to `i - 1`, `res` includes `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`, and `arr[start_index + i - 2]` is not equal to `i - 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs operations based on the constraints of `i`, `start_index`, and the list `arr`. If certain conditions are met, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `None`.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
