Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, where n is the length of the array `arr`. `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n. `arr` is a list of integers. `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. `is_already_stairs` is `True`.**

The variable `is_already_stairs` has been set to `True`. All other variables (`i`, `start_index`, `arr`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
