### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the MEX operation as required by the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **MEX Calculation Missing:**
   - The problem specifies that the MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) of a subarray should be calculated and then used to update the subarray. However, the program does not contain any logic to compute the MEX of a subarray. Instead, it attempts to maximize the sum of the array using a recursive approach that does not involve MEX calculations.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible sum of a subarray, but it does so by considering different subarray splits and adding the values from `arr` and the results of recursive calls. This approach is fundamentally different from the MEX operation, which is essential for the problem.

3. **Inconsistent Logic:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to construct a sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum. However, it relies on the incorrect sum calculation from `func_1` and does not correctly implement the MEX operation. As a result, the sequence of operations it generates will not be valid according to the problem's requirements.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     1 100 2 1
     ```
     The correct output should be:
     ```
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
     However, the program will not produce this output because it does not compute the MEX of the subarray [2] or [2, 1]. Instead, it will try to maximize the sum using a different, incorrect approach.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The MEX operation is a crucial part of the problem, and the program's approach to maximizing the sum without computing the MEX is fundamentally flawed.

Final: **False**
