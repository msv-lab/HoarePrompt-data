The code snippet `res.append((start_index, start_index + i))` appends a tuple to the list `res`. The tuple consists of `start_index` and `start_index + i`.

- `start_index` remains a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n.
- `i` remains a non-negative integer such that 0 < i - 1 <= n - start_index.
- `j` remains equal to `i`.
- `arr` remains a list of integers.
- `is_already_stairs` remains `False` because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` is not equal to its index.
- `arr[start_index + i - 1]` remains not equal to `i - 1`.
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is still called.
- `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i - 1 <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and now includes `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called.**
