The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range defined by `i + 1`. Therefore, we can only adjust `j` and consider the condition for the loop to execute one more time based on the value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i \leq n - \text{start_index}\).
- `j` is 1.
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq \text{start_index} < n\).
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed.
- If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
- The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i \leq n - \text{start_index}\), `j` is 2, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq \text{start_index} < n\), `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.**
