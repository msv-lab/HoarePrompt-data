### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` using the specified operations. The operations involve selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX value.
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by transforming the array into a sequence where each element is the MEX of the entire array, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` and store the result in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to explore different subarray splits and compute the maximum sum.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, in which case the function returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]`.
   - For larger subarrays, the function considers different splits and computes the maximum sum by adding the values from `arr` and the results of recursive calls.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is designed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - If the length of the subarray is 1 and the element is greater than 0, no operation is needed, so it returns an empty list.
   - If the length of the subarray is 1 and the element is 0, it returns a single operation to set the element to 1.
   - If the maximum value in the subarray is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, it returns a single operation to set the entire subarray to the MEX value.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the optimal split and combines the results of the recursive calls.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is designed to transform a subarray into a sequence where each element is the MEX of the subarray.
   - It checks if the subarray already forms a sequence from 0 to `i`. If it does, it returns.
   - If the subarray does not form the sequence, it recursively transforms the subarray and appends the necessary operations to `res`.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the input, initializes the memoization dictionary `res_dict`, and calls `func_1` to compute the maximum sum.
   - It then calls `func_2` to construct the sequence of operations.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function does not handle the case where none of the conditions are met, leading to a potential `None` return, which is not valid for the problem's requirements.
  - The function should always return a list of operations, even if it is empty.

- **Function `make_stairs`**:
  - The function `make_stairs` is not defined with the correct parameters. It should take `start_index` and `end_index` as parameters to correctly transform the subarray.
  - The function also does not handle the case where the subarray is already in the desired form correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly handle all cases and may return `None` in some scenarios, which is not valid. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
