Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i - 1 <= n - start_index, `j` is `start_index + i + 1`, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i - 1]` are all equal to `i - 1`, `res` includes `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr[start_index + i - 2]` is not equal to `i - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which implies that the value of `i` is decremented by 1.
- The condition `0 < i - 1 <= n - start_index` still holds true after the function call.
- The value of `j` remains `start_index + i + 1` because `j` is not affected by the function call.
- The elements `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i - 1]` are now all set to `i - 1` instead of `i`.
- The tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)` is now included in `res` instead of `(start_index, start_index + i)`.
- The variable `is_already_stairs` remains `False`.
- The condition `arr[start_index + i - 2]` is not equal to `i - 2` still holds true, as the function call does not affect this condition.
