Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, `j` is 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and the element at the index `start_index + j` in `arr` is not equal to `j`.**
