### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum of a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, in which case the function returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]`.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it considers different splits and recursively calculates the maximum sum.
   - The function stores the result in `res_dict` to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for constructing the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the maximum value for the subarray.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is greater than 0. If so, it returns an empty list (no operations needed). If not, it returns a list with a single operation to set the element to 1.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it appends the operation to set the entire subarray to the MEX value and returns the result.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks different splits to find the operations that achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is used to transform a subarray into a sequence where all elements are set to the MEX value.
   - It checks if the subarray already forms a sequence from 0 to `i`. If it does, it returns.
   - If the subarray does not form such a sequence, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting all elements to `i` and appending the operation to `res`.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly computes the maximum possible sum for a subarray by considering all possible splits and using memoization to optimize the calculation.
  - The base case and recursive cases are well-defined and cover all necessary scenarios.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
  - It handles the base case and the case where the entire subarray can be set to the MEX value.
  - The recursive checks for different splits ensure that the function finds the correct sequence of operations.

- **Function `make_stairs`**:
  - The function is designed to transform a subarray into a sequence where all elements are set to the MEX value.
  - It correctly checks if the transformation is already done and performs the necessary operations if not.
  - The function ensures that the operations are appended to `res` and the subarray is modified accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` together correctly solve the problem as described. They compute the maximum sum and construct the sequence of operations to achieve it, ensuring that the number of operations does not exceed the limit of 500,000.

**Correctness: True**
