Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index (i.e., `arr[start_index + k] != k` for some `k` in the range 0 to `i`). Additionally, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.**
