Output State: **`i` must be at least 1, `start_index` must be a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq \text{start_index} < n\), `j` is `start_index + i + 2`, `arr[j]` is now equal to `i`, `n` must be greater than `start_index + i + 2`**

The code `arr[j] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element in the array `arr` at index `j`. The value of `j` is `start_index + i + 2`, and the value of `arr[j]` is updated to `i`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
