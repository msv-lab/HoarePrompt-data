The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `i`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= i <= n - start_index`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1. The value of `i` remains the same.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, `j` is 1, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.**
