The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Based on the initial state, we have two cases for `cnt` and `ans`:

1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`.
2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.

In both cases, the value of `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `ans` will be `min(n, 2)`.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` will be `min(0, 0)`, which is 0.

Since `n` is greater than 0, in the first case, `ans` will be 2 if `n` is greater than 2, or `n` if `n` is less than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `ans` is `min(n, 2)`.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 2 or 0, `ans` is `min(n, 2)` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
