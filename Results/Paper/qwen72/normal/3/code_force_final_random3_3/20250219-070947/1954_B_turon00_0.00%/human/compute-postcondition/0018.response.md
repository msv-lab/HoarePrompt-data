The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and 0.**
