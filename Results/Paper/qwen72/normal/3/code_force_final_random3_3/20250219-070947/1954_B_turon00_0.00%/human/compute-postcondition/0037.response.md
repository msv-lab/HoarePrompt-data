Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If `len(aa) == 1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the new `a` that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the new `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0. If `len(aa) != 1`, the values of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
