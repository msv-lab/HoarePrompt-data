Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is 0 or `n` depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` is now 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged, which is 0 or `n` depending on the condition whether `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
