The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Based on the initial state:

- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and 0, which is 0.

In both cases, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`.**
