Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.***
