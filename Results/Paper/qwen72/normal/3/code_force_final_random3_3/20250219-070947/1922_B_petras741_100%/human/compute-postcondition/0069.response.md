The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `n + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `j` will be 2 in the next iteration. The range `n + 1` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 2, and if `q[2]` > 0, `eta` contains the element 1. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
