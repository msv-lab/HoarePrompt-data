Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 1, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[0]]` and `q[w[1]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[1]` in the list `q` by 1.
- Initially, `q` was a list of `n + 1` zeros, with `q[w[0]]` already incremented by 1.
- After the code execution, `q[w[1]]` is also incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `w`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
