The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `n + 1`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be such that `j` is less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for `j` to be less than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 2, and `eta` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `q[j]` is greater than 0, or an empty list if `q[j]` is 0.**
