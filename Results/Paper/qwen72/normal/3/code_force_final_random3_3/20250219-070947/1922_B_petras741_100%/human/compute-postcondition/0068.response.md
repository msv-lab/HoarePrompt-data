Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 1, and if `q[j]` > 0, `eta` contains the element 1. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.***
