To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `i` is 0 (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `buffer` is an empty list (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `w` is a list of integers input by the user (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1.
   - `j` is `n` (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `eta_ln` is 1.
   - `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]` (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).

2. **Relevant Variables:**
   - `n` is the key variable here. The `print` statement calculates the combination formula for choosing 3 items out of `n` items, which is given by \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \).

3. **Calculation:**
   - The formula \( \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \) is used to compute the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items.
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the formula will always produce a valid integer result.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the result of the formula \( \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \).

Given the initial state and the formula, the output will be the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

Output: **\(\frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6}\) (where \(n\) is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
