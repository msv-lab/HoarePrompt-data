Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `q[w[0]]` which is 1, `q[w[1]]` which is 1, and `q[w[2]]` which is now 2, `j` is 2.** 

The value of `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
