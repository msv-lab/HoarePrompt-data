Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `j` is 2, and `eta` is a list containing the element 1 if `q[j]` is greater than 0. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` now contains the additional element 2. Otherwise, `eta` is an empty list or a list containing the element 0 if `q[0]` is greater than 0.***
