Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.** 

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 1, `i` remains 2, `buffer` is still an empty list, `w` is still a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is still greater than or equal to 0, `q` is still a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is still `n`, `eta` is still a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is now the length of `eta`.
