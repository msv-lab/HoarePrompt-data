Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, all values in `counter` are 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all the elements of `a` and an additional element that is `ans[-1] - 1`, such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 1`.**
