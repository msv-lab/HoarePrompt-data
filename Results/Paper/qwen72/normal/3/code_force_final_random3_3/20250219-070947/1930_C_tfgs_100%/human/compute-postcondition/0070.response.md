The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, `n` represents the length of the array `a`, and `a` contains `n` integers. The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the processing of the array `a`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array `a`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Since the function signature does not include parameters, we assume the function reads these inputs from an external source (e.g., user input, file, etc.).

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a result for each test case based on the processing of the array `a`.**
