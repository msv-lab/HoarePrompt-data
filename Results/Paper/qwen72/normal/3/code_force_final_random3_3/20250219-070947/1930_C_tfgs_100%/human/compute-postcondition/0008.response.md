Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a[i]` is now `a[i] + (i + 1)` for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is n-1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5.
- The list `a` still contains `n` integers, but each element `a[i]` has been incremented by `i + 1`.
- The loop index `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
