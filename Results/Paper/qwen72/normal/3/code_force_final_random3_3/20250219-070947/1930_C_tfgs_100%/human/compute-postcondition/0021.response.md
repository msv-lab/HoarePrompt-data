Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` contains the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- After executing the code, `ans` will contain two instances of the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `counter`, `cur`, `cnt`, `adv`, `j`) remain unchanged.
