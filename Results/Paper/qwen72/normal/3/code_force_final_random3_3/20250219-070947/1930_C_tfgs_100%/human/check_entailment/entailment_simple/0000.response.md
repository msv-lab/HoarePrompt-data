### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Array Transformation**:
   - The program correctly transforms the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is necessary to simulate the insertion of `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Set Operations**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each transformed element in `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This ensures that the elements are processed in the correct order to maximize the lexicographical order of the resulting array `b`.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program uses a loop to construct the result array `ans` by appending elements from the sorted `a` and additional elements that are one less than the previous element.
   - The loop ensures that the total length of `ans` is `n` by appending the necessary number of elements to fill the array.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which should be the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Transformation Step**:
  - The transformation `a[i] += i + 1` is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

- **Set and Counter**:
  - Using a `Counter` to count occurrences and converting `a` to a set to remove duplicates is a valid approach.
  - Sorting `a` in descending order ensures that the largest possible elements are considered first.

- **Result Construction**:
  - The loop correctly appends elements from the sorted `a` to `ans`.
  - The additional elements are appended to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where all elements in `a` are the same or where `a` has unique elements.
  - The use of `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` ensures that the program does not append invalid elements (i.e., elements that are already in the set or elements that would make the array longer than `n`).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input, transformation, set operations, and result construction as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
