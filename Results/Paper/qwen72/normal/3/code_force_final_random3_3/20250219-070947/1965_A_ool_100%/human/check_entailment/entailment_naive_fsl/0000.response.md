Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles are of size 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles are of size 1, Alice will lose because she can only choose \( k = 1 \) and will be the one to empty the last pile. However, the function `func_1` will return 'Alice' in this case, which is incorrect.

Example Input:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
Bob
```

Actual Output:
```
Alice
```
