Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of lists, `t` is the length of `arr`, `A` is False, `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is 3. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, `not_c` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.***
