### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to keep track of whether Alice or Bob wins.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes using `set(arr)` and then sorting it.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. Therefore, the function returns "Alice" in this case.
   - This check is correct because if the smallest pile size is greater than 1, Alice can remove `k` stones from each pile, where `k` is the smallest pile size, and win immediately.

4. **Checking for Consecutive Pile Sizes:**
   - The program then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. If there is a gap between any two consecutive pile sizes, the game can be won by the player whose turn it is when the gap is encountered.
   - The variable `not_c` is used to check if the pile sizes are consecutive. If they are not, `not_c` is set to `False`.
   - The variable `A` is toggled for each consecutive pile size, effectively simulating the turns of the game.
   - This logic is correct because if the pile sizes are not consecutive, the player whose turn it is when the gap is encountered can choose a `k` that will leave the opponent with a non-consecutive set of piles, thus winning the game.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the final value of `A` is toggled one more time to determine the winner.
   - The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.
   - This final toggling is necessary because if the pile sizes are consecutive, the player whose turn it is will always be able to make a move that leaves the opponent with a non-consecutive set of piles, and the game will continue until one player is unable to make a move.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Initial Check:**
  - The initial check is correct. If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by removing `k` stones where `k` is the smallest pile size.

- **Correctness of the Consecutive Check:**
  - The program correctly identifies if the pile sizes are consecutive.
  - The toggling of `A` for each consecutive pile size simulates the turns of the game.
  - The final toggling of `A` when the pile sizes are consecutive is necessary to determine the winner correctly.

### Issues:
- **Variable `n` is not used:**
  - The variable `n` (number of piles) is read but not used in the function `func_1`. This is not a correctness issue but a minor inefficiency.
  - However, this does not affect the correctness of the program since the number of piles is not needed to determine the winner.

- **Potential Off-by-One Error:**
  - The loop `for i in range(1, len(set_))` correctly checks the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
  - The initial value of `A` is set to `False`, which is correct because Alice goes first. The toggling logic is also correct as it simulates the turns of the game.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly identifies the winner based on the given problem description and logic.
- The initial check and the consecutive check are implemented correctly.
- The final toggling of `A` is necessary and correctly implemented.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
