### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stone counts `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the winner of the game based on the given piles of stones.
   - It first checks if the smallest number of stones in any pile is not 1. If so, Alice wins immediately because she can choose `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will be greater than 1, and thus empty all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest number of stones is 1, the function then checks the differences between consecutive unique stone counts in the sorted set of stone counts.
   - If all differences are exactly 1, the function toggles the boolean `A` for each unique stone count, starting with `A = False`. This is because each player can only remove 1 stone from each pile in this scenario, and the game will end when all piles are empty.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, the function breaks the loop and returns the current value of `A`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always win by removing `k` stones equal to the smallest pile size, thus emptying all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest pile has 1 stone, the game becomes more complex. The key insight is that if the differences between consecutive unique stone counts are all exactly 1, the game will end in a fixed number of moves, and the winner can be determined by the parity of the number of unique stone counts.
   - The function correctly toggles `A` for each unique stone count, which corresponds to the number of moves required to empty the piles. If the number of unique stone counts is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the smallest pile has more than 1 stone correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the smallest pile has 1 stone and the differences between consecutive unique stone counts are all exactly 1 correctly.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the differences are not all exactly 1.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct winner for each test case based on the logic described above.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.
