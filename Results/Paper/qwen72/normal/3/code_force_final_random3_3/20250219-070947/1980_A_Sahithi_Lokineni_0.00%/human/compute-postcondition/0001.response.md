The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function always returns 0, regardless of the input values.
