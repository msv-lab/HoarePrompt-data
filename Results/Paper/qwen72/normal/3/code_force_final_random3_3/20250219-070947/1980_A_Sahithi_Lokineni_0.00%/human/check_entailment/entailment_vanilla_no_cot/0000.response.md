Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that prevent it from working correctly:

1. **Default Value for `defaultdict`**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with `default_value`, which is not defined. It should be initialized with a function that returns the default value, such as `lambda: 0`.

2. **Logic for Counting Missing Problems**: The logic to count the number of problems needed for each difficulty level is incorrect. The program should check if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and calculate the difference accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize defaultdict with int (default value 0)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1  # Increment the count of each difficulty level
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':  # Check each difficulty level
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]  # Calculate the number of problems needed
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- **Default Value for `defaultdict`**: `defaultdict(int)` initializes the dictionary with a default value of 0 for any key that is not already present.
- **Logic for Counting Missing Problems**: The program iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' and checks if the count of problems for that difficulty level is less than `m`. If it is, it calculates the difference and adds it to the total number of problems needed (`ans`).

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for the given problem description.
