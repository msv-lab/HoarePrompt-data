The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `palka`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `palka` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second element in `palka`, and `palka` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to have executed this far.

For the loop to execute one more time, `palka` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element in `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary, and the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was None, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, the second element `i`, and the third element `i`. Otherwise, `pl` remains unchanged and the third element `i` is appended to `pl`.**
