The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `palka`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If `palka` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `palka` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element in `palka`**
