Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**
