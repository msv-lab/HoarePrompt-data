Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `shapes` will hold the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the counts of each unique integer in the list `pl`. The counts are taken from the dictionary `d`, and for each unique integer in `pl` that appears at least 3 times in `palka`, the integer division of its count by 3 is added to `shapes`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `pl`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
