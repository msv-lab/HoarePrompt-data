Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary, and the value of `i` in `d` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The value of `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
