Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`**: These variables are not modified by the loop, so they remain unchanged from their initial state.
- **`palka`**: This list is the input list of integers and is not modified by the loop.
- **`pl`**: This list contains all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. The loop appends an integer to `pl` only if it has not been appended before.
- **`shapes`**: This variable is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3. The loop does not modify `shapes` directly, but it updates `d` and `pl` which are used to calculate `shapes`.
- **`d`**: This dictionary contains each integer from `palka` as a key, and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. The loop increments the count for each integer as it iterates through `palka`.
- **`i`**: This variable is the current integer being processed in the loop. After the loop completes, `i` will be the last integer in `palka`.

The loop iterates through each integer in `palka`, updating the dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each integer and appending each unique integer to the list `pl`. The final state of `pl` will contain all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `d` will contain the counts of each integer in `palka`. The variable `shapes` is calculated based on the counts in `d` and the unique integers in `pl`.
