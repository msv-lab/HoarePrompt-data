Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players) and `p` (the list of positions to be removed).
   - It repeatedly subtracts the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
   - This correctly simulates the process of removing players from the game based on the positions in `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The function returns the number of players remaining, which is a non-negative integer less than the smallest element in `p`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, followed by the list `p` and the list `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - However, the function prints the results of `res` after each iteration of the inner loop, which means it prints the results prematurely and repeatedly. This is incorrect because it should print the results only after processing all elements in `qs` for a given test case.

3. **Output Issue**:
   - The function `func_2` should print the results for each test case only once, after all elements in `qs` have been processed.
   - The current implementation prints the results after each element in `qs` is processed, leading to incorrect and redundant output.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should move the print statement outside the inner loop, so it prints the results for each test case only once.

Given the reasoning above, the program is incorrect due to the premature and repeated printing of results in `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
