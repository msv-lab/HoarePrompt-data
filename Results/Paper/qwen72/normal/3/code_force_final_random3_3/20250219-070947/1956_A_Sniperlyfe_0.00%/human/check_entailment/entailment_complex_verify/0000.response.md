Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The primary issue with the program is indeed the premature printing of the results inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This causes the output to be split across multiple lines, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The expected output format is a single line of results for each test case, but the program prints each result as soon as it is computed, leading to multiple lines of output for each test case.

To correct this, the `print` statement should be moved outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`, so that all results for a given test case are printed together after the loop completes. Here is the corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

This change ensures that the results for each test case are printed on a single line, as required by the problem description.

Final: **False**
