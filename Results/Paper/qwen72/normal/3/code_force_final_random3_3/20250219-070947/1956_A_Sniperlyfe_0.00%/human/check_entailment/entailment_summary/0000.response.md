### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves an initial line-up of `n` players.
   - In each round, players at positions specified by the sequence `a` are removed.
   - The game continues until no more players can be removed.
   - The goal is to determine the number of winners for different initial player counts `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players) and `p` (the sequence of positions to remove).
   - It repeatedly subtracts the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
   - The function returns the final value of `n`, which represents the number of players remaining after all rounds.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` (the length of the sequence `p`), `q` (the number of initial player counts to test), the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It processes each initial player count `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function correctly implements the logic of removing players in each round.
- It uses a while loop to continue removing players until no more can be removed.
- The condition `n >= min(p)` ensures that the loop stops when `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`.
- The subtraction `n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly counts and removes the players at positions specified by `p` that are still within the range of `n`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.
- It processes each test case by reading the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
- It calls `func_1` for each initial player count and appends the result to `res`.
- It prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Output Formatting:**
  - The function `func_2` prints the results for each test case immediately after processing each initial player count. This means that the results for each test case are printed multiple times, which is incorrect.
  - The correct behavior should be to print the results for each test case only once after processing all initial player counts for that test case.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the output formatting issue, we need to move the print statement outside the loop that processes each initial player count.

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Conclusion:
- The original `func_1` is correct.
- The original `func_2` has an issue with output formatting, but it can be easily fixed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

However, with the minor fix mentioned above, the program would be correct.
