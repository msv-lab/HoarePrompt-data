To determine what will be printed by the `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `k` and `q` are input integers.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `n` is the second element in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is a variable that must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is a variable with the value 2.
   - `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, and it must have at least 2 elements.
   - `n` is the second element in the list `qs`.
   - `res` is a list that contains the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` twice.

3. **Understanding the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses `' '.join(map(str, res))` to convert each element in the list `res` to a string and then join them with a space.
   - This means the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `res`.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, the output will be the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice, separated by a space.
   - The exact value of `func_1(n, p)` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but we can describe it based on the given information.

Given the initial state and the structure of the `print` statement, the output will be:

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where the result of func_1(n, p) is the value returned by the function func_1 when called with the second element of the list qs and the list p)**
