The only objects in the loop head are variables `n` and the list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in `qs`, and `_` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 3 elements, and `n` will be the third element in `qs`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**
