The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and the list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `qs`. If there are more elements in `qs`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in `qs`, and `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be the next element in `qs`, and `qs` must have at least 3 elements. The state of `res` will be updated in the loop body, but it is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted here.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**
