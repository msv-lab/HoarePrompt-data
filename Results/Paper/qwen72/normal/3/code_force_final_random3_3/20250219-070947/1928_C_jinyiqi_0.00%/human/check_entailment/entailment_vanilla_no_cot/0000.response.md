Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return all divisors of `x`. However, it returns a list of divisors in a specific order that is not necessary for the problem. The function should simply return all divisors of `x`.

2. **Logic for Determining Valid `k`**:
   - The logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed. The program checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, but these conditions are not sufficient to determine valid `k` values. The correct approach should involve checking the periodicity of the sequence and ensuring that `k` fits the given constraints.

3. **Periodicity and Constraints**:
   - The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions. Therefore, for a given position `n` and number `x`, the valid `k` values should be such that `n % (2k - 2)` fits the pattern of the sequence. Specifically, `x` should be within the range of the sequence for the given `k`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The program appends valid `k` values to a list and then converts it to a set to remove duplicates. However, the logic for appending and checking valid `k` values is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Determine the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
- Check if each divisor `d` can form a valid `k` such that `k = (d + 2) / 2` and `k >= x`.
- Ensure that `k` fits the periodicity of the sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_divisors(x):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != x // i:
                divisors.append(x // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    valid_ks = set()
    
    # Check divisors of n + x - 2
    divisors = find_divisors(n + x - 2)
    for d in divisors:
        k = (d + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and k >= x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    # Check divisors of n - x
    divisors = find_divisors(n - x)
    for d in divisors:
        k = (d + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and k >= x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    print(len(valid_ks))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`find_divisors` Function**: This function returns all divisors of `x` in a list.
- **Main Loop**:
  - For each test case, we find the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
  - For each divisor `d`, we calculate `k = (d + 2) // 2` and check if it is greater than 1 and greater than or equal to `x`.
  - If `k` is valid, we add it to the set `valid_ks`.
- **Output**: Finally, we print the length of the set `valid_ks`, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
