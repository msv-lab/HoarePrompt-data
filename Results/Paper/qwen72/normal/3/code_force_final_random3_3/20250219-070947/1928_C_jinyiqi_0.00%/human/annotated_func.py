#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is `int(x
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns the sum of `output2` and the reversed `output1`. Since `output1` is reversed and `output2` is not defined in the initial state, the program returns an error due to the undefined variable `output2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 <= x < n <= 10^9) and returns a list containing the divisors of `x` in a specific order. The list includes all divisors of `x` found by iterating from 1 to the square root of `x`, with the smaller divisors in ascending order followed by the larger divisors in descending order. The function does not modify the input `x` or any other variables outside its scope.
