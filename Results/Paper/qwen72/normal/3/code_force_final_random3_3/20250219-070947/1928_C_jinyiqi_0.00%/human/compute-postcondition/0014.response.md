Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 3. If `x % 3 == 0`, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3, 3]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3), int(x / 3)]`. If `x` is divisible by 1 but not divisible by 3, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3)]`. Otherwise, `output1` is a list containing `[2, 3, 3]` and `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2), int(x / 3), int(x / 3)]`.***
