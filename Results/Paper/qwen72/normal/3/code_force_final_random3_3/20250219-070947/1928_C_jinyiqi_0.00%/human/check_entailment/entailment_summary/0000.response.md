### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two values: \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It uses a function `func_1` to find all divisors of these values.
   - It then checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \), and appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of \( x \) by iterating from 1 to the square root of \( x \).
   - It adds both the divisor and its corresponding quotient to the output list.
   - It returns the list of divisors in a specific order: larger divisors first, followed by smaller divisors.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \), which is a necessary condition for \( k \) to fit the settling pattern.
   - The program ensures that the divisors are unique by converting the list to a set before printing the result.
   - The logic for determining the valid \( k \) values is sound, as it correctly accounts for the periodic nature of the settling pattern.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where \( k = 1 \) explicitly, but the problem statement already excludes \( k = 1 \).
   - The program should ensure that the divisors are within the valid range for \( k \) (i.e., \( k > 1 \)).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The execution summary confirms that `func_1` behaves as expected, finding all divisors of the given values.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary. It correctly identifies and counts the valid \( k \) values for each test case.
