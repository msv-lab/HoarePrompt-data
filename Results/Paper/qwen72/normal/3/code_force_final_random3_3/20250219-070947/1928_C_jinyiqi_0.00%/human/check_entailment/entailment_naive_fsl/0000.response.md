Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program is missing the logic to handle the case where `n == x + 1`. According to the problem description, if Vasya's position `n` is exactly one more than the number `x` he received, then there are no valid `k` values that fit the constraints. This is because the sequence of numbers assigned to positions in the line must repeat every `2k - 2` positions, and for `n == x + 1`, no `k` can satisfy this condition.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 3
```
Here, `n = 4` and `x = 3`. According to the problem, there should be no valid `k` because `n` is exactly one more than `x`. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and might output a non-zero number of valid `k` values, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n == x` correctly. For example, if `n = 5` and `x = 5`, the only valid `k` is `5`, but the program might not output this correctly.

To fix these issues, the program should include checks to handle these edge cases explicitly.
