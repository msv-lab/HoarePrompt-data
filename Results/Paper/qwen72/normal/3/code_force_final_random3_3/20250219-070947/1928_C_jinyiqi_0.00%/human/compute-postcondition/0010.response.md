Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by 1 and `x % i == 0`, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2)]`. If `x` is divisible by 1 but not divisible by `i`, `output1` is a list containing `[1]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x]`. Otherwise, `output1` is a list containing `[2]` and `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2)]`.***
