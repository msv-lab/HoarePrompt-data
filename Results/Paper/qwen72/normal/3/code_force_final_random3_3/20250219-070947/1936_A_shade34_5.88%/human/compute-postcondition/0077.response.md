Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this detail is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `'?'` is a string literal.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will print the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak` (which is 0), followed by the value of `mak` again (which is 0), followed by the value of `i` (which is 1), and finally followed by the value of `i` again (which is 1).

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
