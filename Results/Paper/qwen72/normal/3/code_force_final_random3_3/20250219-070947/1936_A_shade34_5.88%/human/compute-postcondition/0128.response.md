Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` is a list containing the indices for which the user input was `=`.
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Variable Analysis:**
   - `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` will be the first element of the `pans` list.
   - `i` is 1, so `pans[i]` will be the second element of the `pans` list.
   - The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the first element of `pans` twice, and then the second element of `pans` twice.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `pans` must have at least 2 elements, let's denote the first element of `pans` as `pans[0]` and the second element of `pans` as `pans[1]`.
   - The print statement will output: `'?'`, `pans[0]`, `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, `pans[1]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact values of `pans[0]` and `pans[1]` are not provided, but we know they are indices from the `pans` list.
   - The output will be a string starting with `'?'` followed by the first element of `pans` repeated twice, and then the second element of `pans` repeated twice.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the `pans` list and [pans[1]] is the second element of the `pans` list)**
