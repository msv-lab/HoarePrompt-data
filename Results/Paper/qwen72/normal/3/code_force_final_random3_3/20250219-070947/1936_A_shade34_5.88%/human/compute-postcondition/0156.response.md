Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` is set to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input. If the user input is '<', `mak` is set to 1. If the user input is anything else, `mak` is not defined, which would result in an error.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the precondition does not specify the user input, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak` without additional information.
   - If the user input is '<', `mak` will be 1, and the print statement will output `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If the user input is not '<', `mak` will not be defined, and the print statement will raise a `NameError`.

Given the precondition, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2 (if the user input is '<', otherwise a NameError will be raised)**
