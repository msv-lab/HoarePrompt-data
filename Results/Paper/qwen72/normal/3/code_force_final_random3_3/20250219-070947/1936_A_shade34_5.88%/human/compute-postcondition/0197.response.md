Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `s` is the new user input string. If the new `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[2]`. If the new `s` is `=`, `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1, 2]`. If the new `s` is any other value, `pans` remains an empty list.***
