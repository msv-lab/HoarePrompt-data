The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates in an interactive environment where it can make queries and receive responses. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and the response to each query is one of "<", ">", or "=". The function must determine and return a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the XOR of the elements at these indices, p_i ⊕ p_j, is maximized. The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
