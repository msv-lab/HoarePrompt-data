Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If `s` is `=` or any other value, `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.**
