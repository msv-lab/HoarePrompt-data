The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, and the user input is a string. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
