Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` is either an empty list, a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `=`, or a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this doesn't affect the print statement directly).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 1.
   - If `s` is `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values.
   - If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` was `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `mak2` is printed twice, so we need to determine its value.
   - `mak` and `mak2` depend on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` is `<`, both `mak` and `mak2` are 1.
     - If `s` is `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values (which are not specified in the initial state, so we assume they are undefined or some initial value).
     - If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values (again, not specified).

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **If `s` is `<`:**
     - `mak` is 1.
     - `mak2` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 1`.
   - **If `s` is `=`:**
     - `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values (let's denote them as `mak_original` and `mak2_original`).
     - The print statement will output: `? mak_original mak2_original 2 mak2_original`.
   - **If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`:**
     - `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values (let's denote them as `mak_original` and `mak2_original`).
     - The print statement will output: `? mak_original mak2_original 2 mak2_original`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `s` is `<`, the output will be: `? 1 1 2 1`.
   - If `s` is `=`, the output will be: `? mak_original mak2_original 2 mak2_original`.
   - If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, the output will be: `? mak_original mak2_original 2 mak2_original`.

Since the initial values of `mak` and `mak2` are not specified in the initial state, we can't determine their exact values if `s` is `=` or neither `<` nor `=`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 2 [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are 1 if `s` is `<`, and retain their original values otherwise)**
