Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 2.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` has no impact on the values of the variables `n`, `i`, or `mak`. It only ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which is already stated in the initial conditions. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
