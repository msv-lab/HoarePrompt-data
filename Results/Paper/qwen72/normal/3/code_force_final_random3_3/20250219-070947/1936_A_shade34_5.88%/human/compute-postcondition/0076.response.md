The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `range(1, n)`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start from 1, not `n-1`.

State: **`pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1**
