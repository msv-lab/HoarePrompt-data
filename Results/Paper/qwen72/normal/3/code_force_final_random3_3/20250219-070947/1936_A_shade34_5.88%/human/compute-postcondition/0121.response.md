Output State: **`pans` is `[2]`, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is now the input string. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is 1. If the new `s` is `=`, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` retains its original value. If the new `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` retains its original value, and `pans` is `[2]`.**
