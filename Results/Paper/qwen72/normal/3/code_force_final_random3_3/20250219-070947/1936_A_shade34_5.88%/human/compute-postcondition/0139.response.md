Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` must have at least 4 elements.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - If the user's current input is `>`, then `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` is either 2 or 0 depending on the user's current input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The elements `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` will be accessed based on the values of `mak` and `i`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **If the user's current input is `>`:**
     - `mak` will be 2.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', pans[2], pans[2], pans[3], pans[3])`.
     - This will print the elements at index 2 and index 3 of the `pans` list, each repeated twice.
   - **If the user's current input is not `>` (i.e., any other input):**
     - `mak` will remain 0.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[3], pans[3])`.
     - This will print the elements at index 0 and index 3 of the `pans` list, each repeated twice.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user's current input is `>`:
     - Output: **? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[2] is the element at index 2 of the pans list and pans[3] is the element at index 3 of the pans list)**
   - If the user's current input is not `>`:
     - Output: **? pans[0] pans[0] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[0] is the element at index 0 of the pans list and pans[3] is the element at index 3 of the pans list)**

Since the user's current input is not specified, we need to consider both scenarios:

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3] (where mak is 2 if the user's current input is `>`, otherwise mak is 0, and pans[3] is the element at index 3 of the pans list)**
