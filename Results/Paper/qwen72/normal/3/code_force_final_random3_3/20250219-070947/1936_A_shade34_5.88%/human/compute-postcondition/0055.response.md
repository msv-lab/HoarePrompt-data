Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans` List**: The list `pans` is described as having at least 2 elements. However, the exact values of these elements are not specified.
2. **`i` Variable**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
3. **`mak` Variable**: The variable `mak` is not defined in the initial state. This means that `mak` is either a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code or it is a typo. Since we don't have information about `mak`, we cannot determine its value.

### Execution:
- The `print` statement will attempt to print the following:
  - The string `'?'`.
  - The value of `pans[mak]` twice.
  - The value of `pans[i]` twice, where `i` is 1.

### Output:
Since `mak` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError` when it tries to access `pans[mak]`. Therefore, the print statement will not execute successfully, and no output will be produced. Instead, an error will occur.

Output: **NameError: name 'mak' is not defined**
