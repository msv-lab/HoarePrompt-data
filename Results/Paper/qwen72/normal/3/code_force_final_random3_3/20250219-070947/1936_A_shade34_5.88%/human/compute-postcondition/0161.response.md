Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input.
   - If the user input is '<', then `mak` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains 2.

4. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly set to 3.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?'.
   - It will then print the value of `mak` twice.
   - Finally, it will print the value of `i` twice.

6. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is '<', `mak` is 1.
     - The output will be: `? 1 1 3 3`.
   - If the user input is anything other than '<', `mak` is 2.
     - The output will be: `? 2 2 3 3`.

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both possible scenarios:

- If the user input is '<':
  Output: **? 1 1 3 3**
- If the user input is anything other than '<':
  Output: **? 2 2 3 3**

Given that the initial state does not specify the user input, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is '<', otherwise [mak] is 2)**
