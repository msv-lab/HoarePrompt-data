The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If `s` is `=` or any other value, `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.**
