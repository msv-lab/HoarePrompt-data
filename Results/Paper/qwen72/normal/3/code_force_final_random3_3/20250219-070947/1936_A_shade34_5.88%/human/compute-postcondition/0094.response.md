Output State: **`pans` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

The code snippet `pans = []` reassigns the variable `pans` to an empty list. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
