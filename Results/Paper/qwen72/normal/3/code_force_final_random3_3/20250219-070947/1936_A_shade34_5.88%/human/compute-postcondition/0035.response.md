Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `s` is `<`:
     - `mak` is 0.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `pans` is a list containing `[0]`.
   - If `s` is not `<`:
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`).
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to `=`.
     - `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is equal to `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - The value of `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` is `<`, then `mak` is 0.
     - If `s` is not `<`, then `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `s` is `<`:
     - `mak` is 0.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 1 0`.
   - If `s` is not `<`:
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`).
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak]`, where `[mak]` is the value of `mak`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `s` is `<`:
     Output: **? 0 0 1 0**
   - If `s` is not `<`:
     Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, or 0 if no user input was `<`)**

So, the final output depends on the value of `s`. If `s` is `<`, the output is specific. If `s` is not `<`, the output is described in terms of `mak`.
