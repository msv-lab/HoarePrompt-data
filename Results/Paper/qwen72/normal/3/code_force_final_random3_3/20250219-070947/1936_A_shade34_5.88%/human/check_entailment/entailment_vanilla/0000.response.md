### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` and for each `i`, it asks a query `? mak mak i i`.
   - The response from the query is used to update `mak` if `p_mak | p_mak` is less than `p_i | p_i`.
   - This step ensures that `mak` is the index of the element in the permutation that has the maximum value when ORed with itself.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak2` to `mak` and `pans` to an empty list.
   - It then iterates over all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and asks a query `? mak mak2 i mak2`.
   - The response from the query is used to update `mak` and `pans`:
     - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i | p_mak2` is greater than `p_mak | p_mak2`, so `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
     - If the response is `=`, it means `p_i | p_mak2` is equal to `p_mak | p_mak2`, so `i` is added to `pans`.
   - This step ensures that `mak` and `pans` contain indices of elements that are candidates for the maximum XOR value.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the indices in `pans` and asks a query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]`.
   - The response from the query is used to update `mak` if `p_pans[i] | p_pans[i]` is greater than `p_pans[mak] | p_pans[mak]`.
   - This step ensures that `mak` is the index of the element in `pans` that has the maximum value when ORed with itself.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program outputs the indices `mak2` and `mak` as the answer to the test case.
   - It flushes the output to ensure the result is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis:
- The program uses a total of `2n - 1` queries in the worst case:
  - `n - 1` queries to find the maximum OR value.
  - `n` queries to find the second maximum OR value.
- The program correctly handles the interaction by flushing the output after each query.
- The logic ensures that the indices `mak2` and `mak` are chosen such that `p_mak2 \oplus p_mak` is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
