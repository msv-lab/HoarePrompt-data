Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous state), `n` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `4 + 2n`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended twice.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged from the initial state, still being greater than 0 but decreased by 1 from its previous state.
- The value of `n` remains the same, still being the integer value of `data[idx-1]`.
- The list `a` is updated to contain `n` integers, where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`.
- The list `data` remains unchanged, still being a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- The value of `idx` remains the same, still being `4 + 2n`.
- The list `results` remains unchanged, still containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended twice.
