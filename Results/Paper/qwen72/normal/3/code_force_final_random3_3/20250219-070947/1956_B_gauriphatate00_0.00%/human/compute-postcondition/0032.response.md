The function `func_2` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it might return some result based on the input parameters, such as a processed list or a specific value derived from the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` and appears at most twice. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided.**
