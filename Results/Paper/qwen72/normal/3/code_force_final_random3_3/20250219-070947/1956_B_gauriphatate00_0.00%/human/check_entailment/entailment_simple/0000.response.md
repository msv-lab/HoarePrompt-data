### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input**: `n` (a positive integer) and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice).
   - **Logic**:
     - The function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
     - It then calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) by summing up the number of integers that appear exactly twice.
     - The function returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The logic is correct because the maximum number of points you can score is limited by the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you get (`n // 2`).
     - If you have more pairs than turns, you can only score as many points as the number of turns you have.
     - If you have fewer pairs than turns, you can only score as many points as the number of pairs you have.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input**: Multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each test case consists of a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
   - **Logic**:
     - The function reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It then processes each test case by:
       - Reading the value of `n` and the list `a`.
       - Calling `func_1` with `n` and `a` to get the result.
       - Appending the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - The final loop prints each result, which is the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description. It correctly handles multiple test cases and computes the maximum number of points you can score by taking your turns optimally.

### Correctness:
**True**
