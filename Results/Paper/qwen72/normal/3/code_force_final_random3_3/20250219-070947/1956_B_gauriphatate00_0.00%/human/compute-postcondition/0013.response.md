Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous state), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`.**
