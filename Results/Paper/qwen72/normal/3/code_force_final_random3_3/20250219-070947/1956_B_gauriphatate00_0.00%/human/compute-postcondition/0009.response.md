Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the strings in `data[idx:idx + n]`.**
