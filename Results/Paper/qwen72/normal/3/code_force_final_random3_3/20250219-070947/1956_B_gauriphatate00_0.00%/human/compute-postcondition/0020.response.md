Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous state), `n` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx-1:idx-1 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `4 + 2n`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended twice.**

Explanation:
- `idx` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `4 + 2n`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `results`) remain unchanged, but the value of `n` and `a` are now based on the previous value of `idx` (i.e., `idx-1`).
- The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous state) remains valid.
- The list `data` and the list `results` remain as they were in the initial state.
