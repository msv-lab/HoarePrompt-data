### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards.
   - Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize your score, you should try to play cards that have a matching card in Nene's hand as soon as possible, so that you can score points.
   - Nene, being optimal, will play her cards in such a way that she scores points and minimizes your ability to score points.

3. **Function 1 Analysis (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes `n` (the number of cards each player has) and `a` (the list of integers on your cards).
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs of cards you have (`pairs`).
   - The function returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.

   **Explanation:**
   - The number of pairs of cards you have is the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - Since each player takes `n` turns, you can only score points for at most `n // 2` pairs (because each pair can only score once).
   - Therefore, the maximum number of points you can score is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2`.

4. **Function 2 Analysis (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` from the input.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n` and `a` to compute the result for the test case.
   - It appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

   **Explanation:**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses `func_1` to compute the optimal score for each test case.
   - The results are stored and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally.

Correctness: **True**
