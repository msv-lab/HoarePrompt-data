Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is 0.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the first element in the `data` list. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx`) remain unchanged.
