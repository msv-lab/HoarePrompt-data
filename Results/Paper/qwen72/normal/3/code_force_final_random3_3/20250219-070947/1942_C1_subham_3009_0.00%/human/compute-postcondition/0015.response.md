Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 3` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers of length `x`**. 

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now `t - 3`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 still holds.
