Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `best_y` is `x - 2`.**
