Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is the greatest value of `gcd_val + y` for any `y` in the range `(x - 1, 0, -1)`, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` that maximizes `max_sum` or `1` if no such `y` exists, and `y` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The variable `test_cases` remains a list of integers where each integer `x` is between 2 and 1000.
- The variable `x` is still the first integer in the `test_cases` list.
- The variable `results` remains an empty list, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `max_sum` is updated to the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop execution, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `y` is any integer in the range from `x - 1` down to 1.
- The variable `best_y` is updated to the value of `y` that produced the highest `max_sum`. If no `y` in the range `(x - 1, 0, -1)` results in a `current_sum` greater than the initial `max_sum` (which is 0), `best_y` remains 1.
- The variable `y` is 0 after the loop finishes, as the loop decrements `y` from `x - 1` down to 1, and then the loop terminates.
