The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `x`. The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` and decreasing by 1 until `y` reaches 1. At the end of the last iteration, `y` was `x - 2`.

To execute the loop one more time, `y` needs to be decreased by 1, so the new value of `y` will be `x - 3`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y`, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
