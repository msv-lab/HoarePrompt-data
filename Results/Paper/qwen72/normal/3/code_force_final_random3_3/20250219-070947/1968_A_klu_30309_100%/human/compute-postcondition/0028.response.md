The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first integer in the list, and `test_cases` must have at least 1 integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 2 integers, and `x` will be the second integer in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the greatest value of `gcd_val + y` for any `y` in the range `(x - 1, 0, -1)`, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` that maximizes `max_sum` or `1` if no such `y` exists, and `y` is 0**
