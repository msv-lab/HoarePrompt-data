Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `gcd_val` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
- Since `y` is `x - 1`, the GCD of `x` and `x - 1` is always 1 (because consecutive integers are coprime).
- Therefore, `gcd_val` is 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
