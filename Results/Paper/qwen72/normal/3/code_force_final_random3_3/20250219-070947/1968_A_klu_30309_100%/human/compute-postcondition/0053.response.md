Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + 1` and `best_y` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to 1, decrementing `y` by 1 in each iteration.
- In each iteration, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is calculated, and the sum of this GCD and `y` is stored in `current_sum`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y`.
- The loop breaks immediately after the first update to `max_sum` and `best_y`.
- After all iterations, `y` will be 1, and the final values of `gcd_val` and `current_sum` will be based on the GCD of `x` and 1.
- The `results` list will contain the value of `best_y` after the loop completes, which will be the first `y` value that caused an update to `max_sum` and `best_y`.
- The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
