Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the user input.
- Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now input integers, the conditions for `k` are not yet evaluated, and `k` remains unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by the code snippet, so they retain their initial values.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now specific input integers.
