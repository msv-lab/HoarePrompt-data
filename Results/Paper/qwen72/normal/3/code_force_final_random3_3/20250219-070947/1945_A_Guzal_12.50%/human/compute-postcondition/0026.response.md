Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `a + (b + c) // 3`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The expression `(b + c) // 3` performs integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3, and the result is added to `a`.
- The new value of `k` is the sum of `a` and the integer division result of `(b + c) // 3`.
