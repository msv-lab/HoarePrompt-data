The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the purpose of the loop execution.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
