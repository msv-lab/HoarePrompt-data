### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Logic for Tents Calculation:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert requires a separate tent, so the number of tents for introverts is `a`.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3` (full tents) plus an additional tent if there are any remaining extroverts (`b % 3 != 0`).
   - **Universals:** Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. They can fill the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents if necessary.

3. **Conditions for Impossibility:**
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts. This is a valid condition for impossibility.
   - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means the total number of extroverts and universals cannot be evenly divided into tents of 3 people each. This is also a valid condition for impossibility.

4. **Tents Calculation:**
   - If the conditions for impossibility are not met, the function calculates the total number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
   - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it adds one more tent to account for the remaining people.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated number of tents for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The conditions for impossibility are correctly identified and handled.
- The calculation of the total number of tents is logically sound and follows the problem's constraints.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 2 3`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 people (2 extroverts + 1 universal), and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 4 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: 4 extroverts require 2 full tents, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a complete tent with the remaining extrovert.
- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 4 2`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 people (2 extroverts + 1 universal), and 1 tent for the remaining 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: 1 extrovert requires 2 more people to form a complete tent, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough.
- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1 3 2`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 people (3 extroverts), and 1 tent for the 2 universals.
- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `19 7 18`
  - Output: `28`
  - Reason: 19 tents for the introverts, 2 tents for 6 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals. The remaining 16 universals form 5 full tents and 1 tent with 1 universal.
- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: No participants, so no tents are needed.
- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `7 0 0`
  - Output: `7`
  - Reason: 7 introverts, each requiring a separate tent.
- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `0 24 0`
  - Output: `8`
  - Reason: 24 extroverts, forming 8 full tents.
- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Output: `1666666667`
  - Reason: 1000000000 introverts, 333333333 full tents for extroverts, and 1 additional tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals. The remaining 666666667 universals form 222222222 full tents and 1 tent with 1 universal.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem's constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
