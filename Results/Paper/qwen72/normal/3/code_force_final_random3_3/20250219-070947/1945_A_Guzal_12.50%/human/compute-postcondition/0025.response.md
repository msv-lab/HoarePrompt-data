The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the integer `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is independent of the initial state and is always `-1`.

Output: **-1**
