Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3.**

The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so `k` is now `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
