Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, and `y` is now equal to the third element of `inp`. If `a` ≤ `y`, `ans` remains 0 or 1 (depending on the condition in the previous iteration). If `a` > `y`, `ans` is 1 or 2 (depending on the condition in the previous iteration).***
