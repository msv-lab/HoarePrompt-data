Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 1, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`, `x` is `n + 1` if `a` > `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is equal to `a`. `y` is `n + 1` if `a` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is equal to `a`. If `a` ≤ `n + 1`, `ans` is 0. If `a` > `n + 1` and `a` ≤ `y`, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.***
