Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 1, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to the initial `x` (which is `n + 1`), `y` is the smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` and less than or equal to the initial `y` (which is `n + 1`), `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 2·10^5.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `inp` is a list of integers from the input, and it must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- The variable `a` will be the last element of `inp` after the loop has completed.
- The variable `x` will be the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to the initial value of `x` (which is `n + 1`).
- The variable `y` will be the smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` and less than or equal to the initial value of `y` (which is also `n + 1`).
- The variable `ans` will be the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations of the loop.
