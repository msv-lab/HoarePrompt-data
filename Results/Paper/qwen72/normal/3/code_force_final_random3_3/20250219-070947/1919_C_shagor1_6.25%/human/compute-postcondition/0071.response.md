Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to the initial `x` (which is `n + 1`), `y` is the smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` and less than or equal to the initial `y` (which is `n + 1`), `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the input integer provided, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `inp`, `a`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
