Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` has been initialized to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
