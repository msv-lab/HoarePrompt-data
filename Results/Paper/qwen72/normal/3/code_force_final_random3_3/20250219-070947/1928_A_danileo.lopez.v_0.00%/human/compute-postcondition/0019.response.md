The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, the function returns the area of the rectangle formed by the dimensions `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the dimensions of a rectangle, and an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns the area of the rectangle formed by `a` and `b`.**
