The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
