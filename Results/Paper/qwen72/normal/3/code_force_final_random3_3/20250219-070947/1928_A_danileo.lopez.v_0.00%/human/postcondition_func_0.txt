The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from user input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. After processing all test cases, the function prints 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd. The function does not return any value.
