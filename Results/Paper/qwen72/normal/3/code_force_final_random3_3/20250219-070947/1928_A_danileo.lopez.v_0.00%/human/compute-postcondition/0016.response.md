The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string 'No'. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the initial state.

Output: **No**
