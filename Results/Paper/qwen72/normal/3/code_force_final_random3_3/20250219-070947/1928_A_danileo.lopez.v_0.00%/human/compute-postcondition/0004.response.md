Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder and does not have a specific value.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- Either `a` is even or `b` is even.

The code snippet is:
```
print('Yes')
```

This code simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on any of those variables or conditions. It will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
