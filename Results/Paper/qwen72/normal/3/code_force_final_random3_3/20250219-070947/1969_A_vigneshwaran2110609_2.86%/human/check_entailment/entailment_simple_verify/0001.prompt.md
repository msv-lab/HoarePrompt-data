You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should return the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met for any `i` in the range from 0 to `x-1` for any of the `n` test cases. If the condition was never met for any test case, `flag` remains unchanged, and the program prints 3 for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The key points are:
1. Each friend \( i \) will come to the party if both \( i \) and \( p_i \) receive an invitation.
2. The best friend relationships are given by the list \( p \), and each \( p_i \) is distinct and not equal to \( i \).

The provided program attempts to solve this problem, but it has some logical issues. Let's break down the program and identify these issues:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( n \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( x \) and the list of best friends \( l \).

2. **Checking for Pairs:**
   - The program iterates over the list \( l \) and checks if \( l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1 \).
   - This condition checks if the best friend of \( l[i] \) is \( i \). If this condition is true, it sets a flag and prints 2, then breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints 3.

**Issues:**
1. **Incorrect Pair Check:**
   - The condition \( l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1 \) is not the correct way to check if two friends are each other's best friends. The correct condition should be \( l[l[i] - 1] - 1 == i \).
   - This is because \( l[i] \) gives the best friend of \( i \), and \( l[l[i] - 1] \) should give \( i \) back if they are each other's best friends.

2. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. It should reset the flag for each test case, but it does not do so.

3. **General Logic:**
   - The program assumes that if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, the minimum number of invitations is 2. This is correct.
   - However, if there is no such pair, the program always prints 3, which is not necessarily correct. The minimum number of invitations could be 2 in some cases (e.g., if there are two separate pairs of friends who are not each other's best friends but can still be invited together).

**Correct Approach:**
1. For each test case, identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
2. If such pairs exist, the minimum number of invitations is 2.
3. If no such pairs exist, the minimum number of invitations is 3 (since inviting any 3 friends will ensure at least 2 come).

**Corrected Program:**

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        found_pair = False
        for i in range(x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] - 1 == i:
                found_pair = True
                break
        print(2 if found_pair else 3)

func()
```

**Explanation:**
- The program reads the number of test cases \( n \).
- For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( x \) and the list of best friends \( l \).
- It initializes a flag `found_pair` to `False`.
- It iterates over the list \( l \) and checks if \( l[l[i] - 1] - 1 == i \) to find pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
- If such a pair is found, it sets `found_pair` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
- Finally, it prints 2 if a pair is found, otherwise it prints 3.

Correctness: **False**  
The provided program has logical issues and does not correctly handle the problem as described. The corrected program should be used instead.
