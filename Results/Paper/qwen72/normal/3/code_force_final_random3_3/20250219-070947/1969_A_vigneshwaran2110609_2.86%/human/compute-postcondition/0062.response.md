The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`. The integer `n` represents the number of friends, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list `p` contains integers where each `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function returns the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.
