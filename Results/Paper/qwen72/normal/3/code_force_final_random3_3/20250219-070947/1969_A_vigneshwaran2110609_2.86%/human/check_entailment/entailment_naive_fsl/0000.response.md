Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The program prints `2` if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and `3` otherwise. However, this does not always yield the correct minimum number of invitations.

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3
2
```

Actual Output:
```
2
3
2
```

While the actual output matches the expected output for the given examples, consider a different input:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 1 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

In this case, the correct minimum number of invitations is `2` (inviting friends 1 and 2 will result in both friends 1 and 2 attending the party, as friend 2 is the best friend of friend 1 and vice versa). However, the program prints `3`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
