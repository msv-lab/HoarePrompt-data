Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should return the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `x - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is not modified unless the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met for any `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`. If the condition is met, `flag` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the condition is never met, the program prints 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations, `i` is `x-1`, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met for any `i` in the range from 0 to `x-1`. If the condition was never met, `flag` remains unchanged, and the program prints 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `x-1`, `x` is an integer, `n` must be greater than `x`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met at any point during the loop, `flag` is True and the program prints 2. If the condition was never met, `flag` remains unchanged and the program prints 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
