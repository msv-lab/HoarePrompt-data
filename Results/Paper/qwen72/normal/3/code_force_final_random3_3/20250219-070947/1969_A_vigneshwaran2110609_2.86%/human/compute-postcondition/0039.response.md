Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, `flag` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values for `i`, `x`, `n`, `l`, and `flag`.***
