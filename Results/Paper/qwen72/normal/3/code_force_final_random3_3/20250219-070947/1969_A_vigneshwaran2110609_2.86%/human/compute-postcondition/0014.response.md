Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is not modified. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.***
