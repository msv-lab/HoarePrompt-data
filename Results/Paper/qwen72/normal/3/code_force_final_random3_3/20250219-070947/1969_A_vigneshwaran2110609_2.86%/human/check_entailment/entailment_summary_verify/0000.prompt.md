You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers from user input. It then checks if there exists any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found for any test case, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `x`, and `l` as they were last set, and a `flag` variable that is True if the condition was met for any test case, or remains undefined if the condition was never met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The program prints `2` if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and `3` otherwise. However, this does not always yield the correct minimum number of invitations.

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3
2
```

Actual Output:
```
2
3
2
```

While the actual output matches the expected output for the given examples, consider a different input:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 1 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

In this case, the correct minimum number of invitations is `2` (inviting friends 1 and 2 will result in both friends 1 and 2 attending the party, as friend 2 is the best friend of friend 1 and vice versa). However, the program prints `3`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
