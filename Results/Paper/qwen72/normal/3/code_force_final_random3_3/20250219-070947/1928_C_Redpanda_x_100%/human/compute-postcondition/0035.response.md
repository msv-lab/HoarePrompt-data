Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
