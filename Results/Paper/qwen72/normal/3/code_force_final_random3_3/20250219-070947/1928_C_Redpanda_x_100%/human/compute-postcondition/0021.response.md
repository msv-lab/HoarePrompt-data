Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, and a value `factor * 1` has been yielded.**

Explanation: The code snippet multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`, where `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`. Since `prime_to_i` was initially 1, after the multiplication, `prime_to_i` becomes equal to `primes[k]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
