Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

The value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, where `factor` is the first element of `rest` and `prime_to_i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
