To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, so `count` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
   - If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Since `j` is 1, the `print` statement will split the string `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` will be the substring from the beginning of the string up to (but not including) the index `j`.
     - `string[j:]` will be the substring from index `j` to the end of the string.
   - Given `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of the string, and `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the first character of the string followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
