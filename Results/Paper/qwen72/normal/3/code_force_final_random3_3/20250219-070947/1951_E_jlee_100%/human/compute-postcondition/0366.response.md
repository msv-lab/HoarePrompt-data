Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0. If the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, unless `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, in which case `count2` is set to 0, `done` remains unchanged, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. If the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1 and `done` remains unchanged.***
