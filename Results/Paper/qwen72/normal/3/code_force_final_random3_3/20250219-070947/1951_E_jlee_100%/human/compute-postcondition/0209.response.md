Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise, `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` > 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `count2` is 0, and the current iteration is skipped.***
