Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` and `count2` remain unchanged.
- `done` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

### Print Statement:
```
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`string[:j]`**:
   - This is a slice of the string `string` from the start up to (but not including) the index `j`.
   - Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of the string `string`.

2. **`string[j:]`**:
   - This is a slice of the string `string` starting from index `j` to the end.
   - Since `j` is 1, `string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from the second character to the end.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the first character of the string `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
Output: **[first character of string], [rest of string starting from the second character]**
