To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the precondition and the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Precondition Analysis:
- `n` is the length of the input string `string`.
- `j` is `n-1`, which means `j` is the index of the last character in the string.
- `count` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `count2` is either unchanged or increased by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `done` is `False`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

### Execution Context:
The `print('YES')` statement is executed within a loop. The loop's behavior is influenced by the condition that if `x` (the first character of `string`) is not equal to the last character of `s` (which is the same as the last character of `string`), the loop skips the rest of the current iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Condition**: The loop starts with `x` being the first character of `string` and `j` being the index of the last character of `string`.
2. **Comparison**: The loop checks if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s` (which is `string[j]`).
3. **Skip Condition**: If `x` is not equal to `string[j]`, the loop skips the rest of the current iteration, and the `print('YES')` statement is not executed.
4. **Print Statement**: The `print('YES')` statement will only be executed if `x` is equal to the last character of `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the precondition, the `print('YES')` statement will only be executed if the first character of `string` is equal to the last character of `string`. If this condition is met, the output will be 'YES'. If the condition is not met, the loop will skip the print statement, and nothing will be printed.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' (if the first character of `string` is equal to the last character of `string`)**
