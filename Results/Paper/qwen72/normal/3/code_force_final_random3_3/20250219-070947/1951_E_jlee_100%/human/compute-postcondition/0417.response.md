To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `count` and `count2` remain unchanged.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is incremented by 1 and `done` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `count` is 1 or greater, `done` remains unchanged.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is unconditional and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
   - The statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `n`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement will print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
