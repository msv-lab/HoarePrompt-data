Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s`, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `count` is the index of the first character in the new `s` that is not equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of characters in the new `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` was found, and `done` is False if the loop has not found a condition to print 'YES' and break. Otherwise, `done` remains True.**
