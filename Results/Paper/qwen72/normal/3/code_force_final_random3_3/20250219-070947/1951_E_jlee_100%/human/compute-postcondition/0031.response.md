Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, and `x` is the first character of `s`. If all characters in `s` are equal to `x`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s` and `n` is not 1, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then if `n` is odd, the middle element of `s` is not `x`. If `n` is even, or if `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is `x`, the middle element of `s` is `x`.***
