Output State: **`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, `done` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `done` to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `count`, and `count2`) are not affected by this code, so their states remain unchanged. The condition that `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0 is still valid. The value of `j` remains 1, and `count` and `count2` remain unchanged. The variable `done` is now explicitly set to `True`.
