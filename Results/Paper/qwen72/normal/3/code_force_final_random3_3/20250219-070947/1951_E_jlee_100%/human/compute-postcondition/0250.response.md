Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count` is greater than 0, `done` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `done` is explicitly set to `True` by the code. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `count`) are not affected by this assignment, so their initial states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `done` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
