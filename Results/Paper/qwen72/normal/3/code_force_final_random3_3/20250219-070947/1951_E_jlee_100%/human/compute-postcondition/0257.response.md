Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `count` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, or if `count` is greater than or equal to 1, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains unchanged.***
