Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n` is greater than 0**: This means `s` is a non-empty list.
2. **`j` is 1**: This indicates that the current index being considered is the second element of the list `s`.
3. **`count` is greater than 0**: This means `count` is already a positive integer.
4. **Conditions for `count` and `done`**:
   - The condition `if s[j] is not equal to x and count was less than 1` is not relevant here because `count` is already greater than 0.
   - The condition `if s[j] is equal to x or count is greater than or equal to 1` is always true because `count` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, the program will always continue to the next iteration of the loop based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement is not dependent on any of the conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `n`, `j`, `count`, `s`, or `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
