Output State: **`n` is the length of `string`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, `count2` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i + 1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `done` is `False`, `x` is the first character of `string`.
