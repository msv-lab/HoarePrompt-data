To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `count` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`.
   - `count2` is increased by 1 if `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, or if `count` is greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that does not involve any variables or conditions from the initial state, it will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
