To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`.
- `count2` is increased by 1 if `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, or if `count` is greater than or equal to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(string)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `string`**:
   - The variable `string` is not explicitly defined in the initial state or the code snippet.
   - Since `string` is not defined, it is impossible to determine its value based on the given information.

2. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `count` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `done` is a boolean that depends on the values of `s[0]` and `s[n-1]`, and `s[j]` and `s[n-1-j]`.
   - `count2` is increased by 1 under certain conditions, but its initial value is not provided.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `string` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet, the `print(string)` statement will raise a `NameError` because `string` is not recognized.

Output: **NameError: name 'string' is not defined**
