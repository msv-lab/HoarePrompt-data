Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is greater than or equal to 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `count2` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
- Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, `done` remains unchanged and `count2` is not modified.

The `print('YES')` statement is executed independently of the conditions described in the initial state. The conditions only affect the values of `count`, `count2`, and `done`, but do not influence the `print` statement itself.

Therefore, the `print` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `n`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
