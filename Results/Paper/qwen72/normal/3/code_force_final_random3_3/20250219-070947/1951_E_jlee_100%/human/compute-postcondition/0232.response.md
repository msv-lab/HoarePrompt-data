Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count` is 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the flow of the loop, causing the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
