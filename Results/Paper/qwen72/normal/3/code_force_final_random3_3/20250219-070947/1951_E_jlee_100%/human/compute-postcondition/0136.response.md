Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count2` is either 2 or 0, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` is either True (if `count` > 1) or False (if `count` ≤ 1). If `count` > 1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` ≤ 1, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
