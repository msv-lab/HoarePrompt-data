Output State: **`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0.**

The variable `count` is initialized to 0, and the other variables (`t`, `s_list`, `s`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged with their initial values.
