Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
