Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
- `k` is 2.
- `n - j` must be greater than 2.
- If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `j` and `k`**:
   - `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 2`.
   - `k` is 2.

2. **Check the condition for `count`**:
   - The condition for `count` is: If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.
   - This means we need to check the values of `s[2]` and `s[2 + j]`.

3. **Evaluate the condition**:
   - `s[2]` is the third character in the list `s`.
   - `s[2 + j]` is the character at index `2 + j` in the list `s`.
   - The condition checks if either of these characters is '?' or if they are equal. If any of these conditions are true, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

4. **Calculate `count * 2`**:
   - If the condition is true, `count` is 1, so `count * 2` is 2.
   - If the condition is false, `count` is 0, so `count * 2` is 0.

### Final Output:
The `print(count * 2)` statement will print the value of `count * 2` based on the condition described. Since the exact values of `s[2]` and `s[2 + j]` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

Output: **2 if `s[2]` is '?' or `s[2 + j]` is '?' or `s[2]` equals `s[2 + j]`; otherwise, 0**
