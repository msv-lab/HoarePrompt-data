Output State: **`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2, `count` is 0.** 

The initial value of `count` is explicitly set to 0, and the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
