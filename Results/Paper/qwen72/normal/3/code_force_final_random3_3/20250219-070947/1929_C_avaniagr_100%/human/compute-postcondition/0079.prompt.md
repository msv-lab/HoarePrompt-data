You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k, x, and a are integers for each test case where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are taken from the corresponding line in the input. If `x < k - 1`, the loop checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise prints 'NO'. If `x == k - 1`, the loop checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2` and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise prints 'NO'. If `x > k - 1`, the loop calculates `z` starting from `k - 2` and updates it by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` iterations. If `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `z`, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates with or returns values based on the integers `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, where `t` is between 1 and 1000, `k` is between 2 and 30, `x` is between 1 and 100, and `a` is between 1 and 10^9.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
