### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the input from standard input. The first line is skipped (as it contains the number of test cases `t`), and the loop iterates over each subsequent line, which contains the values `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
     - If Sasha can lose at most `x` times in a row, and `x` is less than `k - 1`, then he can always recover from any sequence of losses by placing a bet of 1 coin after each loss. This ensures that he can always win back his losses and continue betting.
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` checks if Sasha has enough coins to place a bet of 1 coin after `x` consecutive losses. If he does, he can guarantee to win any number of coins. If not, he cannot.

   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
     - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, then he needs to have enough coins to place a bet of 1 coin after `k - 1` consecutive losses and still have at least 1 coin left to place another bet.
     - The condition `a >= x + 2` checks if Sasha has enough coins to place a bet of 1 coin after `k - 1` consecutive losses and still have at least 1 coin left. If he does, he can guarantee to win any number of coins. If not, he cannot.

   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
     - If Sasha can lose more than `k - 1` times in a row, the strategy becomes more complex. The function calculates a value `z` starting from `k - 2` and updates it by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` iterations.
     - The value `z` represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to guarantee that he can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.
     - The condition `a >= z` checks if Sasha has enough initial coins to follow this strategy. If he does, he can guarantee to win any number of coins. If not, he cannot.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `a` is very small or when `x` is very large.
   - The logic for calculating `z` in the third case is correct and ensures that Sasha can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions described above, which matches the problem requirements.
