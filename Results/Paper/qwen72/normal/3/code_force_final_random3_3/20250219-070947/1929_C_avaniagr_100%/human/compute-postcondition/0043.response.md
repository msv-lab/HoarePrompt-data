Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input and must be at least `k - 1`, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates `z` by adding the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- Therefore, the new value of `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
