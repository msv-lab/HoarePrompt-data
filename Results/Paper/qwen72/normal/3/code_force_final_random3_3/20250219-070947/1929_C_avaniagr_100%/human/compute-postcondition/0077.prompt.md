Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k, x, and a are integers for each test case where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers for each test case where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9, and the input has at least 2 lines. `k` is the first integer from the second line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the second line of the input, and `a` is the third integer from the second line of the input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, if `a` is less than `x + 1`, the else part is executed. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, if `a` is less than `x + 2`, the else part is executed. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`, `i` is set to `x - k + 3`, and `x - k + 3` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. If `a` is greater than or equal to the updated value of `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to the updated value of `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than the updated value of `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input, and `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input. If `x < k - 1`, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `x >= k - 1`, and `x == k - 1`, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `x >= k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `x` must be at least `k - 3`, and `z` is the result of the expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x - k + 3` times, starting with `z = k - 2`. `i` is set to `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input, and `s` is the next line in the input. If `x < k - 1`, the variables retain their initial values. If `x == k - 1`, the variables also retain their initial values. If `x > k - 1`, `z` is calculated as `k - 2 + (x - k + 3) * (1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1))`, and `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0. In this case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, `i` is set to `x - k + 3 - 1`. If `a` is less than `z`, `i` also remains `x - k + 3 - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
