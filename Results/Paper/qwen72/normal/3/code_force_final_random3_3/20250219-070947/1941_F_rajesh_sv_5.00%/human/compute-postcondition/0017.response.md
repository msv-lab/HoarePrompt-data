Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `index` is set to 2, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf.**

Explanation:
- The code `max_diff = diff` assigns the value of `diff` to `max_diff`.
- Since `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` is now also `A[2] - A[1]`.
- The condition `if diff > max_diff` is no longer relevant because `max_diff` is now equal to `diff`.
- `index` is set to 2 as per the initial state.
- `next_max_diff` remains unchanged at -inf.
- All other initial conditions remain valid.
