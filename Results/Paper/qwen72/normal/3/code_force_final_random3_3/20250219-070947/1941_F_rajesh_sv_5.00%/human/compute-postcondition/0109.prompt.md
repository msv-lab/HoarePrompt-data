Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing, and `l` and `h` are equal. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements). `h` is the index in `D` where `right - f` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`, minus 1.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop has finished executing, and `l` is 1 less than `h` unless the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, in which case `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements). `h` is the index in `D` where `right - f` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`, minus 1, unless the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, in which case `h` is updated to `mid`. `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`; otherwise, `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`l` is 1 less than `h` or `l` is `mid + 1` (if the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true), `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2` (before any updates), `h` is `l + 1` (if the condition is true) or `h` is now `mid` (if the condition is false). The condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is not true, and `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`l` is 1 less than `h` or `l` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `mid`, `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `l` remains 1 less than `h`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
