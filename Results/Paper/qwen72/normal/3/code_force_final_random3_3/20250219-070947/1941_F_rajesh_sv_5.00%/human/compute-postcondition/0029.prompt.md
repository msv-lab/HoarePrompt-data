Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]`, `index` is set to 1, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is None, and if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` <= `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, `index` is set to 2, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is None, and if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` <= `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `index` is set to 3, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. If `diff` <= `max_diff` and `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` remains -inf, and `index` is None. If `diff` <= `max_diff` and `diff` <= `next_max_diff`, then `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is None, and `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
