Postcondition: ***`l` is 1 less than `h` or `l` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `mid`, `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `l` remains 1 less than `h`.***
