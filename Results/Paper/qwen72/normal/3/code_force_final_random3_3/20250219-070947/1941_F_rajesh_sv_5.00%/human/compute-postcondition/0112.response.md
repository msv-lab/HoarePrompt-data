Postcondition: ***The loop has finished executing, and `l` and `h` are equal. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements). `h` is the index in `D` where `right - f` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`, minus 1. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.***
