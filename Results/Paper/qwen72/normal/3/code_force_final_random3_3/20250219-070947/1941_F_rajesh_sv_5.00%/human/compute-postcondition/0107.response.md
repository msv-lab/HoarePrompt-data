Output State: **`l` is 1 less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `mid`, `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation:
- `h` is updated to be equal to `mid`.
- `l` is still 1 less than `h`.
- `mid` is still calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, but since `h` is now `mid`, `mid` remains the same.
- `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` are not affected.
- `f` is still the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements).
- `mid_sum` is still `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is still `D[mid + 1] + f`.
