To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement.

### Initial State:
- The loop has finished executing, and `l` and `h` are equal for each iteration.
- The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is now the minimum value of its initial value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for each `f` in `F` where `l` and `h` are equal.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop has finished executing, and `l` and `h` are equal for each iteration. This implies that the loop has iterated over the entire range where `l` and `h` are equal, and `ans` has been updated accordingly.

2. **Variables**:
   - `D` and `F` are lists.
   - `left` and `right` are fixed values.
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value of its initial value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for each `f` in `F` where `l` and `h` are equal.

3. **Update of `ans`**:
   - For each `f` in `F`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
   - This means `ans` will be the smallest value among all the maximum differences calculated for each `f` in `F`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Conclusion:
- `ans` is the minimum value of its initial value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for each `f` in `F` where `l` and `h` are equal.
- `next_max_diff` is a fixed value that remains unchanged.

### Output:
The print statement will output the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`. Since the exact values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum value of its initial value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f for each f in F where l and h are equal, and next_max_diff is a fixed value)**
