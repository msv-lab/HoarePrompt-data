Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and `l` and `h` are equal. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements). `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`.**

Explanation:
- The line `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` updates the value of `l` to the index in `D` where `left - f` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
