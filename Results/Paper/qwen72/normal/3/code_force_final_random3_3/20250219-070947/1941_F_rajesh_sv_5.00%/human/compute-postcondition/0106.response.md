Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is `mid`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation:
- `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- `h` remains `mid`.
- `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, which now becomes `(mid + 1) + (mid - (mid + 1)) // 2` simplifying to `mid + 1 + (mid - mid - 1) // 2` which is `mid + 1 - 1 // 2` and finally `mid + 1 - 0` or `mid + 1`.
- `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
- `f` is still the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements).
- `mid_sum` is still `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is still `D[mid + 1] + f`.
