Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `index` is set to 3, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, which is the value of `diff`.
- The value of `index` remains set to 3.
- The value of `next_max_diff` remains unchanged at -inf.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid.
