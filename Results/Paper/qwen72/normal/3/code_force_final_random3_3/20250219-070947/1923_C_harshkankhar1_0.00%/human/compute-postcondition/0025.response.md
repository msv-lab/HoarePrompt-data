The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided, with the constraints `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should also validate that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` with the constraints `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function validates the constraints `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`. It returns the results of the queries based on the provided array `c` and the specified indices `l_i` and `r_i`.**
