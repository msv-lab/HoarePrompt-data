#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided, where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should validate that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, `i` is `n`, `a` remains a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `1 <= j <= n`, `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `1` if `a[j]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 1 3 6 10
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `q` is 0, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes an array `a` of positive integers and a set of queries. It first reads the length `n` of the array and the number of queries `q` from the input. It then reads the array `a` and initializes an auxiliary array `b` based on the values in `a`. After processing, `a` is transformed into its prefix sum array. For each query, it reads two indices `x` and `y`, and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in `a` from index `x` to `y` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b` and `x` is not equal to `y`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all queries are processed, the function concludes with `q` being 0 and the final state of `a` being its prefix sum array.
