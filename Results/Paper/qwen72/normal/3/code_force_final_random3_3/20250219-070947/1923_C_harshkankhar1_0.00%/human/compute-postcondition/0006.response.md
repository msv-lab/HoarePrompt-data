The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`.
- `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`.
- `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2**
