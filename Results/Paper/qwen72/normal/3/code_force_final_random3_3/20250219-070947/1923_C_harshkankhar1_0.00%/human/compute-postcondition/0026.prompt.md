You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided, where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should validate that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, `i` is `n`, `a` remains a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `1 <= j <= n`, `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `1` if `a[j]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 1 3 6 10
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `q` is 0, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` with the constraints `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function validates the constraints `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`. It returns the results of the queries based on the provided array `c` and the specified indices `l_i` and `r_i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
