Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- The loop has executed `n` times.
- `i` is `n`.
- `a` is now a list of integers where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original `a` list up to that index.
- `b` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where:
  - `b[0]` is 0.
  - For each `1 <= j <= n`, `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `1` if the original `a[j]` (before the update) is greater than 1, otherwise `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - Each element in `a` is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original `a` list up to that index.
   - For example, if the original `a` list was `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, after the loop, `a` would be `[1, 3, 6, 10]` because:
     - `a[0]` remains `1`.
     - `a[1]` is `1 + 2 = 3`.
     - `a[2]` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
     - `a[3]` is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`.

2. **Understanding `b`**:
   - `b` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`.
   - `b[0]` is 0.
   - For each `1 <= j <= n`, `b[j]` is calculated based on the original `a[j]`:
     - If `a[j]` (before the update) is greater than 1, `b[j]` is `b[j-1] + 1`.
     - If `a[j]` (before the update) is 1 or less, `b[j]` is `b[j-1] + 2`.
   - For example, if the original `a` list was `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `b` would be:
     - `b[0]` is 0.
     - `b[1]` is `0 + 2` (because `a[0]` is 1, which is not greater than 1).
     - `b[2]` is `2 + 1` (because `a[1]` is 2, which is greater than 1).
     - `b[3]` is `3 + 1` (because `a[2]` is 3, which is greater than 1).
     - `b[4]` is `4 + 1` (because `a[3]` is 4, which is greater than 1).
     - So, `b` would be `[0, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

3. **Output of `print(*a)`**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
   - Since `a` is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list, the output will be the cumulative sums of the original elements.

### Final Output:
Output: **[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] (where each element is the cumulative sum of the original elements in the list `a` up to that index)**

For example, if the original `a` list was `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output would be:
Output: **1 3 6 10**
