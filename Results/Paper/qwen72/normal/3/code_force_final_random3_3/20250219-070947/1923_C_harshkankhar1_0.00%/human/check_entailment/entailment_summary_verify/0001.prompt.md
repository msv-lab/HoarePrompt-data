You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes an array `a` of positive integers and a set of queries. It first reads the length `n` of the array and the number of queries `q` from the input. It then reads the array `a` and initializes an auxiliary array `b` based on the values in `a`. After processing, `a` is transformed into its prefix sum array. For each query, it reads two indices `x` and `y`, and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in `a` from index `x` to `y` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b` and `x` is not equal to `y`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all queries are processed, the function concludes with `q` being 0 and the final state of `a` being its prefix sum array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good."
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another subarray `b` such that:
     - The sum of elements in `c` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
     - No element in `c` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases, the length of the array `c`, the number of queries, and the elements of `c`.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program creates an array `b` where each element is either 1 or 2, depending on the value of the corresponding element in `a`.
   - This is done to ensure that `b[i]` is always different from `a[i]` and positive.
   - The array `a` is then converted to a prefix sum array using `accumulate`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
   - If the sum of `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of `b[l_i, r_i]`, or if the subarray has only one element (`x == y`), the subarray is not "good" and the program prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, the program prints "YES".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element (`x == y`), which cannot be "good" because there is no way to form a different positive array `b` with the same sum.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of `b[l_i, r_i]`, which would violate the condition that the sums must be equal.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results in the correct format, with "YES" or "NO" for each query.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the given constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
