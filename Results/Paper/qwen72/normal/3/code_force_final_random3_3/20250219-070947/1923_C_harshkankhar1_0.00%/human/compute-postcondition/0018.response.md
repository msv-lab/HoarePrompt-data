The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate `q` times. Since the loop does not depend on the value of `_` for its continuation, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `q`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must still be greater than 0, but it should be decreased by 1 to reflect the completion of the previous iteration.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y`**. 

However, to be precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`q` is greater than 0 and will be decreased by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y`**.
