The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 1, and `i` starts at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `q` are input integers.
- `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the integers provided by the input.
- `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`**
