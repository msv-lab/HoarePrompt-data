Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed `n` times, `i` is `n`, `a` is now a list of integers where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original `a` list up to that index, `b` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `1 <= j <= n`, `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `1` if the original `a[j]` (before the update) is greater than 1, otherwise `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is greater than 0 and will be decreased by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
