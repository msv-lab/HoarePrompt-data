The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
