Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), `n` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.

Explanation:
- `a` remains a list of positive integers.
- `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), and it is not equal to 1 or 2.
- `winNext` is assigned the result of the function `func_2` called with the arguments `a[1:]` (which is the list `a` starting from the second element) and `n - 1` (which is `n` decremented by 1). The specific value of `winNext` depends on the implementation of `func_2`, but it is the result of that function call.
