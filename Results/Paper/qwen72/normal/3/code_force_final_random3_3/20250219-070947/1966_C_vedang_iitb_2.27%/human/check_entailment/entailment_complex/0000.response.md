### Reasoning:

1. **func_1**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to transform the input list `a` into a new list `a_new` where each element (starting from index 1) is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list of unique elements.
   - This transformation is crucial because it simplifies the problem by reducing the piles to a form where the game can be analyzed more easily. The new list `a_new` effectively represents the differences between the sizes of the piles, which helps in determining the optimal moves.
   - The function ensures that the list `a_new` is sorted and contains unique elements, which is necessary for the subsequent function `func_2` to work correctly.

2. **func_2**:
   - The function `func_2` is a recursive function that determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a_new` and the number of elements `n`.
   - **Base Case 1**: If `n` is 1, Alice wins immediately because she can remove all stones from the single pile.
   - **Base Case 2**: If `n` is 2, the game's outcome depends on whether the first element of `a_new` is even or odd. If it is even, Alice can remove an even number of stones from both piles, leaving Bob with an even number of stones in both piles, and Bob will lose. If it is odd, Alice will be forced to leave an odd number of stones in one of the piles, and Bob will win.
   - **Recursive Case**: For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively checks the rest of the list (`a[1:]`) with `n-1`. The idea is to simulate the optimal move by considering the smallest nonempty pile (which is the first element in the sorted list `a_new`).
   - The function returns 1 if the recursive call returns 2 (indicating Bob would lose in the next turn) or if the recursive call returns 1 and the first element of `a_new` is not 1 (indicating Alice can make a move that forces Bob into a losing position).
   - The function returns 2 otherwise, indicating Bob wins.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to transform the list `a` into `a_new`.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2` with `a_new` and `n` to determine the winner and prints the result.

### Correctness:
- The transformation in `func_1` is correct and necessary for the game analysis.
- The recursive logic in `func_2` correctly handles the base cases and the recursive case, ensuring that the optimal moves are considered.
- The main logic correctly processes the input and calls the functions in the right order.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the program is designed to handle the game correctly and determine the winner based on optimal play.

**Correctness: **True****
