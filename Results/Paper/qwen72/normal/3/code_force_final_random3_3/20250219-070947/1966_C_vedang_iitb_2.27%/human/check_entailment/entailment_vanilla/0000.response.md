### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game is a combinatorial game where players take turns removing the same number of stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of stones in the piles and how it affects the game.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of pile sizes `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of pile sizes.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and then computing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function determines the winner of the game given the transformed pile sizes `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - The base cases are:
     - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones.
     - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on the parity of the smallest pile. If the smallest pile has an even number of stones, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the outcome of the game by considering the first pile and the remaining piles.
   - The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` checks the outcome of the game if the first pile is removed.
   - The function returns `1` if Alice wins and `2` if Bob wins.

4. **Combining the Functions:**
   - The main logic of the program is to use `func_1` to transform the pile sizes and then use `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The transformation in `func_1` is crucial because it simplifies the problem by reducing the pile sizes to their differences, which can be more easily analyzed for parity.

5. **Testing the Program:**
   - The provided test cases should be checked to ensure the program produces the correct output.
   - For example, in the first test case with piles `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the transformation results in `[3]`, and Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one move.
   - In the second test case with piles `[1, 7]`, the transformation results in `[1, 6]`, and Bob wins because Alice must remove 1 stone, leaving Bob with 6 stones to remove on his turn.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The transformation in `func_1` and the recursive analysis in `func_2` are consistent with the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

Correctness: **True**
