The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains `True`.**
