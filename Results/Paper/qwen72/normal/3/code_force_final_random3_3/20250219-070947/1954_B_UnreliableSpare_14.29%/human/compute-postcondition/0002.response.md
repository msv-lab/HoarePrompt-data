Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` must be a beautiful array as defined in the problem description, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `n` is now an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user. `flag` is set to `True`.**
