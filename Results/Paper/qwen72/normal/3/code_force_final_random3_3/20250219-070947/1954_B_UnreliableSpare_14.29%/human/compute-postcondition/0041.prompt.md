You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` must be a beautiful array as defined in the problem description, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: `n` is the same as the input, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `n` is the same as the input, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `val` is the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is the number of times the first element `val` appears consecutively from the start of the array. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `val` appearances before a different element is encountered, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if all elements are the same.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: min(ans, cnt) (where ans is the previous value of ans and cnt is the number of times the first element of arr appears consecutively from the start of the array)
    #State: *`n` is the same as the input, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of times the first element `val` appears consecutively from the start of the array, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` value and `cnt`. If all elements in `arr` are the same, `flag` is `True`. Otherwise, `flag` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. It also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
