Output State: **`n` is the same as the input and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `ans` is 0, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to `val`.**

Explanation:
- The `min` function compares `ans` and `cnt`.
- `ans` was initially `Decimal('Infinity')`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- Since 0 is less than `Decimal('Infinity')`, `ans` is updated to 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
