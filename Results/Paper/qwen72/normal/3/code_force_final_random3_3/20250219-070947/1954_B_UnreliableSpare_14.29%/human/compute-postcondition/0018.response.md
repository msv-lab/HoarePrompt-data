Output State: **`n` is the same as the input, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except that `val` is now set to the first element of the `arr` list, and `cnt` is set to 0.
