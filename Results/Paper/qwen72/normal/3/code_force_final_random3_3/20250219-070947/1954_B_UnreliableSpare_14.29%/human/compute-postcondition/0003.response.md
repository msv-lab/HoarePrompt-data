To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `flag` is set to `True`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is set to 1 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True`**
