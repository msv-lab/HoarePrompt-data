### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same:**
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - It iterates through the array and sets `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are different.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. This part is correct.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized.
   - It uses a variable `val` to store the first element of the array and a counter `cnt` to count the occurrences of `val`.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the occurrences of `val` and updating `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive `val` elements.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program is counting the occurrences of the first element and then finding the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of this element.
   - However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not just the minimum count of consecutive elements.
   - The correct approach would be to ensure that no two adjacent elements can be replaced to form a beautiful array. This can be done by counting the maximum number of elements that can be left in the array without any two adjacent elements being the same and then subtracting this count from `n`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element by printing `-1` (since a single-element array is always beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements).

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The state after the first loop (`flag` check) is accurate: `flag` is `True` if all elements are the same, otherwise `False`.
   - The state after the second loop (counting occurrences of `val`) is also accurate: `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `val` elements before a different element is encountered, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if all elements are the same.
   - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect, as it does not consider the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by ensuring no two adjacent elements can be replaced.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. It does not properly handle the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by ensuring no two adjacent elements can be replaced to form a beautiful array.

### Correctness:
**False**
