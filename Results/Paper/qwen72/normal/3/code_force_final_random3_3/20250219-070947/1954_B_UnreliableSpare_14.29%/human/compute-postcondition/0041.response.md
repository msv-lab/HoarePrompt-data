Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in `arr` before a different element is encountered, and prints this value. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the original `n` and `arr` values, a `flag` indicating whether all elements in `arr` are the same, and `ans` which holds the minimum count of consecutive first elements or `Decimal('Infinity')` if all elements are the same. **
