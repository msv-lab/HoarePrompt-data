### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same:**
   - The program uses a flag (`flag`) to determine if all elements in the array are the same.
   - It iterates through the array and sets `flag` to `False` if it finds any element that is different from the previous one.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Removals:**
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` is `True`), the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If the array has different elements, the program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive occurrences of the first element (`val`).
   - If it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` one last time to account for the last segment of consecutive `val` elements.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Non-Uniform Arrays:**
   - The program only checks the consecutive occurrences of the first element (`val`). This is incorrect because the problem requires making the array non-beautiful, which means breaking the condition `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` for some `i` where `2 \le i \le n - 1`.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of removing elements to break the beautiful condition in arrays where not all elements are the same.

2. **Handling of Beautiful Arrays:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array has only one or two elements, which are trivially non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the general case of making a beautiful array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. It only checks the consecutive occurrences of the first element, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**False**
