Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where each element at the indices present in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`, and all other elements remain 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` in the order they appear.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The variable `l` remains the input integer.
- The list `s` is updated such that each element at the indices present in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`. All other elements in `s` remain 0.
- The list `array` remains unchanged.
- The string `ans` is constructed by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` in the order they appear.
