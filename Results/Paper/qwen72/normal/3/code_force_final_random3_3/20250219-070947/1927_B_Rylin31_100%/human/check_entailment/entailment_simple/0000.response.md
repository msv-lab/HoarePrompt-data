### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - A list `s` of length `l` is initialized with all elements set to 0. This list will keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the string `s` that we are constructing.

3. **Constructing the String**:
   - The function iterates over each element `j` in the trace array `array`.
   - For each `j`, it appends the character corresponding to `chr(s[j] + 97)` to the string `ans`. The expression `chr(s[j] + 97)` converts the integer `s[j]` to a character by adding 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') to it.
   - After appending the character, it increments `s[j]` by 1 to update the count of occurrences for that character.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed string `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Trace Array Interpretation**:
  - The trace array `array` indicates how many times a character has appeared before the current position. For example, if `array[3] = 1`, it means that the character at position 3 in the string has appeared once before.
  - The function correctly uses this information to construct the string by mapping the trace values to the corresponding characters.

- **Character Mapping**:
  - The function uses `chr(s[j] + 97)` to map the trace values to characters. Since `s[j]` starts at 0 and is incremented for each occurrence, the first time a character appears, it will be 'a', the second time 'b', and so on.
  - This ensures that the characters are correctly mapped based on their previous occurrences.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge case where `n = 1` (a single character string) correctly.
  - It also handles the case where all trace values are 0, which corresponds to a string where all characters are distinct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a string `s` that matches the given trace array for each test case. The logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
