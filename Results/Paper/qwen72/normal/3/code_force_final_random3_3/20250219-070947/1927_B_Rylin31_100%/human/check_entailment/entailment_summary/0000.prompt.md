Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a string `ans` by converting each element in `a` to a corresponding character based on the current state of a list `s` of length `n`, where the character is determined by the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `a`. The list `s` is updated by incrementing the value at the index `j` for each element `j` in `a`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case. The final state of the program includes the integer `t` (number of test cases), the integer `i` (which is `t-1`), the integer `l` (the last input integer `n`), the list `s` (where each element is 0 except for the elements at the indices specified by the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`), the list `array` (the last input list of integers), and the string `ans` (the last constructed string).
