Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 \le t \le 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the lost string. a is a list of n integers where 0 \le a_i < n, representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and it is guaranteed that a valid string s exists for each trace.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of length `t` where each element at index `j` (for each `j` in `array`) is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array` in the order they appear in `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where each element at the indices present in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`, and all other elements remain 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` in the order they appear.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0 except for the elements at the indices specified by the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
