Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of length `t` containing all zeros, `array` must have at least one integer, `j` is the first integer in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- Since `s` is a list of zeros, `s[j]` is 0.
- Therefore, `s[j] + 97` is 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'.
- `ans` is now a string containing 'a'.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
