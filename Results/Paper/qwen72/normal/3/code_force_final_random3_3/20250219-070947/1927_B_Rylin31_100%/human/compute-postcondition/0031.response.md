Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
2. `i` is 1.
3. `l` is the input integer.
4. `s` is a list of length `l` where each element at the indices present in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`, and all other elements remain 0.
5. `array` is a list of integers provided by the user.
6. `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` in the order they appear.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `s` Construction:**
   - `s` is a list of length `l`.
   - Each element at the indices present in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`.
   - All other elements in `s` remain 0.

2. **String `ans` Construction:**
   - `ans` is constructed by iterating over each element `j` in `array`.
   - For each `j`, the corresponding element in `s` is `s[j]`.
   - The ASCII value of the character to be added to `ans` is `s[j] + 97`.
   - The character corresponding to this ASCII value is then added to `ans`.

### Example to Illustrate:
Let's assume:
- `l = 5`
- `array = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0]`

#### Step 1: Construct `s`
- `s` is a list of length 5: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Increment each element at the indices present in `array`:
  - Index 0 appears 2 times: `s[0] = 2`
  - Index 1 appears 2 times: `s[1] = 2`
  - Index 2 appears 1 time: `s[2] = 1`
  - Index 3 appears 1 time: `s[3] = 1`
- The list `s` becomes: `[2, 2, 1, 1, 0]`

#### Step 2: Construct `ans`
- Iterate over each element `j` in `array`:
  - `j = 0`: `s[0] = 2`, ASCII value = `2 + 97 = 99`, character = `'c'`
  - `j = 1`: `s[1] = 2`, ASCII value = `2 + 97 = 99`, character = `'c'`
  - `j = 2`: `s[2] = 1`, ASCII value = `1 + 97 = 98`, character = `'b'`
  - `j = 1`: `s[1] = 2`, ASCII value = `2 + 97 = 99`, character = `'c'`
  - `j = 3`: `s[3] = 1`, ASCII value = `1 + 97 = 98`, character = `'b'`
  - `j = 0`: `s[0] = 2`, ASCII value = `2 + 97 = 99`, character = `'c'`
- The string `ans` becomes: `'ccbcbb'`

### General Case:
- `s` is constructed based on the frequency of indices in `array`.
- `ans` is constructed by converting the values in `s` at the indices specified by `array` to their corresponding ASCII characters.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print a string where each character is determined by the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` in the order they appear.

Output: **[ans] (where [ans] is a string constructed by converting the values in `s` at the indices specified by `array` to their corresponding ASCII characters)**
