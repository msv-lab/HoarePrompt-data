The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `array`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `array`. If `array` has at least one element, the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, `array` must have at least one element, and `j` will be the first element of `array`.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `j` is the first element of `array`, `ans` is an empty string**
