Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the minimum length of the segment to be painted white when there are multiple black cells in the strip and the first and last black cells are not the only black cells.

For example, consider the test case:
```
6
BWBWWB
```
The correct output should be 4, as the minimum segment to paint is from the 2nd to the 5th cell, making the strip "WWWWWW". However, the provided program will output 6, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1()`. The function only finds the first and last black cells and calculates the segment length based on these two positions. It does not consider the possibility that there might be other black cells in between that would require a shorter segment to be painted.
