Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 3, `l` is an empty list, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `j` is the last character in `s`, and `ma` is `n` - 3.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ma = len(s) - d` updates the value of `ma` to be the length of the string `s` minus the value of `d`. Since `d` is 3 and `n` is the length of `s`, `ma` becomes `n` - 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
