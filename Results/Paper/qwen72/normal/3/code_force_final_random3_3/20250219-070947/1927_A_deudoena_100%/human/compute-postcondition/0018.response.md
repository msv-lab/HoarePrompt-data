Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character of `s`, `mi` is 3.**

Explanation:
- `mi` is assigned the value of `c`, which is 3.
- The initial state of `t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, `m`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `j` remains unchanged.
- The condition to check if `j` == 'B' and set `mi` to 2 and break out of the loop is not executed because the code snippet only contains the assignment `mi = c`.
