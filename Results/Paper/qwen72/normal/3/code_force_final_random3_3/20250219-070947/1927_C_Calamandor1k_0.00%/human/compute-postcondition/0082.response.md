Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is `k // 2`, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`. If `len_a` is greater than 1, and `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 0. Otherwise, `count_a` and `count_b` remain 0. Additionally, `len_b` is greater than 1.**
