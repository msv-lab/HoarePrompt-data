The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `max(len_a, len_b)` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `d` remain unchanged**
