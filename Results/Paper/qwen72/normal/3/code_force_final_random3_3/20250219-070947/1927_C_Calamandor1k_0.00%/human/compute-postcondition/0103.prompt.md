Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). The lists a and b contain n and m integers, respectively, where each integer a_i and b_j satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
    count_a, count_b = 0, 0
    d = k // 2
    for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
        if len_a > i + 1:
            if a[i] <= k:
                count_a += 1
        if len_b > i + 1:
            if b[i] <= k:
                count_b += 1
    print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `max(len_a, len_b)` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `max(len_a, len_b)` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `d`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `max(len_a, len_b)` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is `k // 2`, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
