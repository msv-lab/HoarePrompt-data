Output State: **`i` is `max(len(a), len(b)) - 1`, `max(len(a), len(b))` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is `k // 2`, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`.**
