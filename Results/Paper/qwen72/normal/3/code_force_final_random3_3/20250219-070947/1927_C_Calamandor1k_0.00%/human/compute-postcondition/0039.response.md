Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `max(len_a, len_b)` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`, `count_b` is the number of elements in the new `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.**
