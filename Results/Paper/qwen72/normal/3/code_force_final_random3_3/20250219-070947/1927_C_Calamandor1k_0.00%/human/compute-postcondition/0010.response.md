Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, and `len_a` is greater than `i + 1` (which means `len_a` is greater than 1). Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
