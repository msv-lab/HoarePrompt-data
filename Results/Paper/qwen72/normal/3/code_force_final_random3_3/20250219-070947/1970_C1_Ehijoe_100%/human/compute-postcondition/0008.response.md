The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure `i < n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `nodes[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element.**
