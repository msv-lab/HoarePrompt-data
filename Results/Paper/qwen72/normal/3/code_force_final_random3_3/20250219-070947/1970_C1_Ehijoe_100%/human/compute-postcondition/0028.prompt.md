Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `nodes` represents a node and its value is a list containing all the nodes it is connected to. `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, and `ends` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        ends.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least one key, `key` is the first key in `nodes`, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, and if `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list containing the first key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least two keys, `key` is the second key in `nodes`, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, and if `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list containing the second key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least three keys, `key` is the third key in `nodes`, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list containing the third key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
