Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `nodes[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, and `nodes[v]` has one more element `u` appended to it.**

The code snippet `u, v = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `u` and `v` to new integers provided by the user input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
