Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the first line of input, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, and `t` is 1. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, and the inputs are expected to be provided in a predefined format. The next `n-1` lines contain pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer `u` indicating the starting node for the round.**
