Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends`, `prev` is the first element of `ends`, `curr` is the first element in the list associated with the key `s` in `nodes`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` and `curr`, `prev` is now equal to the first element in the list associated with the key `s` in `nodes`. If `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, `curr` is now the second element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes`. Otherwise, `curr` is the first element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` now contains the first element of `ends` and the current value of `curr`, `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr` if `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, otherwise `prev` is equal to the second element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes`, `curr` is now the second element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes` and `curr` is not equal to `e` if `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, otherwise `curr` is the first element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes` and `curr` is not equal to `e`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` now contains the first element of `ends` and the current value of `curr`. If `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is now the second element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes`, with `curr` not equal to `e`. Otherwise, `curr` is now the first element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes`, and `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
