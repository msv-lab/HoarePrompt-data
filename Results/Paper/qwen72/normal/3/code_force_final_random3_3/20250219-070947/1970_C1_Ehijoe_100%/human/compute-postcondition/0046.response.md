Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` now contains the first element of `ends` and the current value of `curr`, `prev` is now equal to the second element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes`, `curr` is now the second element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes` and `curr` is not equal to `e`.**
