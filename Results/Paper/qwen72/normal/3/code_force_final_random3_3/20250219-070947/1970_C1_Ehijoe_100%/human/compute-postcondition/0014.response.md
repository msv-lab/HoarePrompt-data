Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `nodes[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, and `nodes[v]` has one more element `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` adds `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. The initial state already mentioned that `nodes[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, and `nodes[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, and `nodes[v]` has one more element `u` appended to it. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `nodes[u]` now containing `v` as an additional element. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
