Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `nodes[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element.**

The code `nodes[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. The initial state indicates that `nodes[u]` already contains `v` as an additional element. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are still the integers provided by the user input. Now, both `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` contain each other as elements.
