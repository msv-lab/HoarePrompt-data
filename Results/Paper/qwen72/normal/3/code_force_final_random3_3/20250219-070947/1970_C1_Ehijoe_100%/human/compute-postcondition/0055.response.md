Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` now contains the first element of `ends` and the current value of `curr`. If `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is now the second element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes`, with `curr` not equal to `e`. Otherwise, `curr` is now the first element in the list associated with the key `curr` in `nodes`, and `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr`.***
