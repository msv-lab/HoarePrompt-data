The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. If the calculated power of 2 is exactly equal to `n`, it prints \(2^{\text{power}}\). If not, it prints \(2^{\text{power} - 1}\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
