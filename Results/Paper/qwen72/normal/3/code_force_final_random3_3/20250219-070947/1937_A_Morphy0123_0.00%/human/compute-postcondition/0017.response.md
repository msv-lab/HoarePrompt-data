Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}}\), `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\) minus 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- `power` is decremented by 1, so its new value is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\) minus 1.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}-1}\) is no longer valid because `power` has been decremented, so the new condition is that `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}}\).
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
