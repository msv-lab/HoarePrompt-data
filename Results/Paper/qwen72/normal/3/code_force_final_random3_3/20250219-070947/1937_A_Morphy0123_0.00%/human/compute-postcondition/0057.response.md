Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is `n_cases - 1`, and for each iteration, `n` is the input integer provided during that iteration. If `n` is 1, the loop prints 1. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the loop prints \(2^{\text{power}}\). If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decreased by 1, and the loop prints \(2^{\text{power}}\).**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `n_cases` remains greater than 0, indicating the total number of test cases.
- The variable `i` is `n_cases - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n_cases` times.
- For each iteration, `n` was the input integer provided at that specific iteration.
- If `n` was 1, the loop printed 1.
- If `n` was greater than 1, `power` was calculated as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` was equal to `n`, the loop printed \(2^{\text{power}}\). If `power` was not equal to `n`, `power` was decreased by 1, and the loop printed \(2^{\text{power}}\).
