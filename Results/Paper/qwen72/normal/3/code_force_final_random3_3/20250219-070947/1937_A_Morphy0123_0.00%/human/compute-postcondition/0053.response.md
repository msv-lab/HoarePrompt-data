Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)` minus 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

The value of `power` is decremented by 1, making it one less than the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
