You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program: 
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input structure, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take an integer `n` as input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and it should be called for multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`. However, the function definition does not reflect this. The correct function definition should be `def func(n):` to match the problem's requirements.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is `n_cases - 1`, and for each iteration, `n` is the input integer provided during that iteration. If `n` is 1, the loop prints 1. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the loop prints \(2^{\text{power}}\). If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decreased by 1, and the loop prints \(2^{\text{power}}\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to find the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the swap operations, but it does not correctly handle the logic for finding the largest divisor and performing the swaps.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Actual Output:
```
4
```

However, the program's logic is flawed. Let's break down the expected behavior:

1. Initially, the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. Perform `swap(2)`: The largest divisor of 2 is 1, so the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`.
3. Perform `swap(3)`: The largest divisor of 3 is 1, so the array becomes `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`.
4. Perform `swap(4)`: The largest divisor of 4 is 2, so the array becomes `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]`.
5. Perform `swap(5)`: The largest divisor of 5 is 1, so the array becomes `[3, 4, 2, 5, 1]`.

After these operations, the position of 1 in the array is 5, not 4.

The program's logic for determining the position of 1 is incorrect and does not match the expected behavior of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
