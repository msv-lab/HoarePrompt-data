Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `power` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `power = 1` sets the variable `power` to 1.
- The initial state specified that `power` was the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\), but this condition is no longer relevant after `power` is explicitly set to 1.
- The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The condition "If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged" is no longer applicable because `power` has been set to 1.
- The condition "If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\)" is still valid, but since `power` is now 1, \(2^{(power-1)}\) is \(2^0\) which is 1. So, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The condition "If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged" is no longer applicable because `power` is now 1, and `n` could be any new input integer.
- The condition "Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1" is no longer applicable because `power` is now 1.
