The value of `power` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `power` was the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\), after decrementing, `power` is now one less than the smallest integer satisfying that condition. The condition `power` is not equal to `n` is still valid.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\), `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\) minus 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
