Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `power` is 1.** 

The value of `power` has been reset to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\) is no longer necessarily true, as `power` is now 1.
