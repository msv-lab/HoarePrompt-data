Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}-1}\).
   - `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is an integer input.
   - `power` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
   - However, the initial state also states that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

3. **Conflicting Information:**
   - The statement "the current value of `power` is equal to `n`" conflicts with the definition of `power` as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
   - For the purpose of this task, we will assume that the current value of `power` is indeed `n`.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - Since `power` is equal to `n`, the expression `2 ** power` will be `2 ** n`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The value of `2 ** n` will be printed, where `n` is the input integer.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **2 ** n (where n is the input integer)**
