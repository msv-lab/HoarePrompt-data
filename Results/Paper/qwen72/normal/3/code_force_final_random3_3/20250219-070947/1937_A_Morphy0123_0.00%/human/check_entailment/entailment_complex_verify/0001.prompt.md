You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

                print(2 ** power)

from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input structure, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take an integer `n` as input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and it should be called for multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`. However, the function definition does not reflect this. The correct function definition should be `def func(n):` to match the problem's requirements.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is `n_cases - 1`, and for each iteration, `n` is the input integer provided during that iteration. If `n` is 1, the loop prints 1. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the loop prints \(2^{\text{power}}\). If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decreased by 1, and the loop prints \(2^{\text{power}}\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. If the calculated power of 2 is exactly equal to `n`, it prints \(2^{\text{power}}\). If not, it prints \(2^{\text{power} - 1}\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Array Setup**:
   - The array \( a \) is initially set such that \( a_i = i \) for each \( 1 \le i \le n \).

2. **Swap Operation**:
   - The operation \(\texttt{swap}(k)\) for an integer \( k \ge 2 \) swaps the elements \( a_d \) and \( a_k \), where \( d \) is the largest divisor of \( k \) that is not \( k \) itself.
   - For a number \( k \), the largest divisor \( d \) is \( k/2 \) if \( k \) is even, and \( \lfloor k/2 \rfloor \) if \( k \) is odd. However, for simplicity, we can focus on the even case since \( k/2 \) is always an integer and the largest divisor for even \( k \).

3. **Effect of Swaps**:
   - When we perform \(\texttt{swap}(k)\) for \( k = 2, 3, \ldots, n \), the element \( 1 \) will be moved to the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \).
   - This is because the largest power of 2 will eventually swap with 1, and no further swaps will affect the position of 1 once it is in the position of the largest power of 2.

4. **Finding the Largest Power of 2**:
   - The program uses the `log2` function to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is a power of 2, the position of 1 will be \( 2^{\text{log2}(n)} \).
   - If \( n \) is not a power of 2, the position of 1 will be \( 2^{\lfloor \text{log2}(n) \rfloor} \).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when \( n = 1 \) by printing 1.
   - For \( n > 1 \), it calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) using the `log2` function.
   - It then prints \( 2^{\lfloor \text{log2}(n) \rfloor} \) as the position of 1.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( n \) is a power of 2.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where \( n \) is not a power of 2 by decrementing the power if necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the specified swaps. Therefore, the program is correct.
