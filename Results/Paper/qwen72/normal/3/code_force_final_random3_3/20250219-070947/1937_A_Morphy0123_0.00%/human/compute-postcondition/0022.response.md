Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\)**

The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer, and `power` is recalculated to be the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}}\) is greater than or equal to the new input integer. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged.
