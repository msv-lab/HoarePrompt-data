Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, then the values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `power` is not equal to `n`, then `power` is decreased by 1, and `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}}\).***
