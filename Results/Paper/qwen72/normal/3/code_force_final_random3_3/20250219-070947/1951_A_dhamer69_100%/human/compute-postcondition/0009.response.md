Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer with the current value of 2, and `s` is an input string. If `s` is '00', the program executes the if part. Otherwise, if `s` is not '00', the program executes the else part.**
