Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the program executes the if part. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, or if `count_1` is 2 and the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part, where either the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1, or `count_1` is not equal to 2.**
