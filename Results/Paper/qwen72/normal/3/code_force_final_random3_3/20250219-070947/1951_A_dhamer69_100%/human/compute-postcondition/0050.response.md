Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` != 2 and `count_1` (the number of '1' characters in `s`) is odd, or if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.**
