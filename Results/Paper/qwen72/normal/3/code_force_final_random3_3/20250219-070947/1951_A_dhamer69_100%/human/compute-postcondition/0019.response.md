Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`, and `count_1` is even. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part, where either the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1, or `count_1` is not equal to 2.**
