Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string.** 

The initial state is updated with `s` being assigned a new input string. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
