Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the conditions for the if part are met. If `s` contains exactly one '11' and `count_1` is 2, the conditions for the if part are also met. Otherwise, the conditions for the else part are met.***
