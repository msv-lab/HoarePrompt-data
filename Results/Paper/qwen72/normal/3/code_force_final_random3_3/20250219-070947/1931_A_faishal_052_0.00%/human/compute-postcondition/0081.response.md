The `arr.sort()` function sorts the elements of the list `arr` in ascending order. The specific values of `arr` depend on the value of `lex`, but the sorting will rearrange the elements accordingly. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are not affected by this operation.

- If `lex` <= 26, `arr` initially contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. After sorting, the list remains [1, 1, `lex` - 2] because the elements are already in ascending order.
- If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` initially contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. After sorting, the list remains [26, 26, `lex` - 52] because the elements are already in ascending order.
- If `lex` >= 52, `arr` initially contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. After sorting, the list remains [26, 26, `lex` - 52] because the elements are already in ascending order.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].**
