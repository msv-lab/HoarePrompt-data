The `arr.sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The exact sorted values of `arr` depend on the value of `lex` as per the initial state conditions. Let's consider the sorted `arr` for each possible range of `lex`:

- If `lex` is less than or equal to 22, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1, 1, lex - 4]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, 1, 1, lex - 4]` because `lex - 4` is less than or equal to 18, which is still the largest value in the list.
- If `lex` is 23, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1, 1, lex - 27]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, 1, lex - 27, 26]` because `lex - 27` is 0.
- If `lex` is greater than 23 and less than or equal to 49, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1, 1, lex - 27]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, 1, lex - 27, 26]` because `lex - 27` is between 0 and 22.
- If `lex` is 50, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1, 1, lex - 52]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex - 52, 26, 26]` because `lex - 52` is 0.
- If `lex` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 74, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26, 1, lex - 28]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, 1, lex - 28, 26]` because `lex - 28` is between 0 and 22.
- If `lex` is 75, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26, 1, lex - 53]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex - 53, 26, 26]` because `lex - 53` is 0.
- If `lex` is greater than 75 and less than or equal to 100, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26, 1, lex - 53]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex - 53, 26, 26]` because `lex - 53` is between 0 and 22.
- If `lex` is 101, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26, 1, lex - 78]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, lex - 78, 26, 26, 26]` because `lex - 78` is 23.
- If `lex` is greater than 101 and less than or equal to 125, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1, 26, lex - 29]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, 1, lex - 29, 26]` because `lex - 29` is between 23 and 47.
- If `lex` is 126, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1, 26, lex - 53]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex - 53, 26, 26]` because `lex - 53` is 23.
- If `lex` is greater than 126 and less than or equal to 150, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1, 26, lex - 53]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex - 53, 26, 26]` because `lex - 53` is between 23 and 47.
- If `lex` is 151, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1, 26, lex - 78]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, lex - 78, 26, 26, 26]` because `lex - 78` is 23.
- If `lex` is greater than 151 and less than or equal to 175, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26, 26, lex - 54]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex - 54, 26, 26]` because `lex - 54` is between 23 and 47.
- If `lex` is 176, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26, 26, lex - 79]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, lex - 79, 26, 26, 26]` because `lex - 79` is 23.
- If `lex` is greater than 176 and less than or equal to 201, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26, 26, lex - 79]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, lex - 79, 26, 26, 26]` because `lex - 79` is between 23 and 47.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 202, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26, 26, lex - 104]`. Sorting this list will result in `[26, 26, 26, 26, lex - 104]` because `lex - 104` is greater than or equal to 23.
