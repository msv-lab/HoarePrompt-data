Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `lex` is `lex - 26`, if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 26]. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 26]. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 26].**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- The conditions for `arr` remain the same, but the value of `lex` is now `lex - 26`.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
