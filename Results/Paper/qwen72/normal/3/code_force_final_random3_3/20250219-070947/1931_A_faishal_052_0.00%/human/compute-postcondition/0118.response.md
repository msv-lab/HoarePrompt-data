Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 26] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, 26] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52.** 

The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `arr` retains its initial values based on the conditions provided for `lex`.
