Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `cases` is greater than 1 (this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is 1 (this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `j` is 2 (this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `k` is 0 (this is relevant to the print statement).
- `lex` is an input integer.
  - If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2].
  - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].
  - If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `arr[k]`**:
   - `k` is 0, so we need to look at the first element of `arr`.
   - The value of the first element of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` <= 26, `arr[0]` is 1.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr[0]` is 26.
     - If `lex` >= 52, `arr[0]` is 26.

2. **Calculate `chr(arr[k] + 96)`**:
   - `arr[k]` is the first element of `arr`, which is either 1 or 26.
   - Adding 96 to `arr[k]`:
     - If `lex` <= 26, `arr[0]` is 1, so `chr(1 + 96) = chr(97) = 'a'`.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr[0]` is 26, so `chr(26 + 96) = chr(122) = 'z'`.
     - If `lex` >= 52, `arr[0]` is 26, so `chr(26 + 96) = chr(122) = 'z'`.

3. **Determine the output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the character corresponding to `arr[0] + 96`.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline is printed after the character.

### Final Output:
- If `lex` <= 26, the output will be 'a'.
- If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), the output will be 'z'.
- If `lex` >= 52, the output will be 'z'.

Output: **'a' if `lex` <= 26, 'z' if `lex` >= 27**
