Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is now equal to `lex - 26`, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, where `lex` was initially an input integer greater than or equal to 52. The states of the other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
