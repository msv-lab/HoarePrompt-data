The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, [1, 26, `lex`] if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 27`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52**
