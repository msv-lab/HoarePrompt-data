Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing [1], `lex` is an input integer minus 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `lex` is less than or equal to 25.**

The value of `lex` is decreased by 1, so the new value of `lex` is the original input integer minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `lex` is now less than or equal to 25.
