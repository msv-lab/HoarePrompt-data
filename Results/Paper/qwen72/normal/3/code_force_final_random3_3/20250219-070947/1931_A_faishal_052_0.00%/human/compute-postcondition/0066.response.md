The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the element 26 to the list `arr`. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `lex` is not directly affected by this code, but the initial conditions for `lex` and `arr` need to be considered.

- If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` already contains the element 1, and `lex` is reduced by 1.
- If `lex` is between 26 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` already contains the element 26, and `lex` remains unchanged.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` already contains the element 26, and `lex` is reduced by 26.

After executing the code, `arr` will contain an additional element 26. The value of `lex` will depend on its initial value, but the code snippet does not change `lex` directly.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list containing an additional element 26, `k` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 26, and `lex` is reduced by 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26, and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26, and `lex` is reduced by 26.**
