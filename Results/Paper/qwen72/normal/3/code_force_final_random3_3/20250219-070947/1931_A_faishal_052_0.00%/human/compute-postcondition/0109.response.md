Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 26].**

Explanation:
- `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- The initial state specifies that if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Therefore, after the code execution, `lex` is now `lex - 26`.
- The list `arr` remains [26, 26] as specified in the initial state when `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
