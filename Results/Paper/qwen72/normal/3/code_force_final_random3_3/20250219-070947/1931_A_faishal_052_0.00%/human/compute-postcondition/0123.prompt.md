Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the integer 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 1]. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 26` if the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1] or [26, 26] respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` and `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 1, 1]. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 1] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, 1] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 28` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 1] or [26, 26, 1] respectively. If `lex` is greater than 26, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 26] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, 26] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52. If the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 26] or [26, 26, 26] depending on whether the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26 or greater than 26 and less than 52, respectively.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
