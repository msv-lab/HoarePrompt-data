The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the range `3`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `3`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than 3.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, [1, 26, `lex`] if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 27`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52**
