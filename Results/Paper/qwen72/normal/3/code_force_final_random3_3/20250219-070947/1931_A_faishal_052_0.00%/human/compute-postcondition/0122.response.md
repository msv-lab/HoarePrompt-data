Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` and `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 1, 1]. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 1] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, 1] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 28` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 1] or [26, 26, 1] respectively. If `lex` is greater than 26, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 26] if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, 26] if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52. If the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 26] or [26, 26, 26] depending on whether the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26 or greater than 26 and less than 52, respectively.***
