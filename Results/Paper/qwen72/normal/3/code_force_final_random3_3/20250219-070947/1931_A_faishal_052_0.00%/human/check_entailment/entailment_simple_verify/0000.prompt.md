You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        
    #State: `cases` is 0, `i` is `cases` - 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, [1, 26, `lex` - 26] if `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), or [26, 26, `lex` - 51] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, when the input is 70, the expected output should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70), but the program will output "azz" (1 + 26 + 26 = 53), which is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic for distributing the remaining value of `lex` across the three letters. The program incorrectly assumes that if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it should always append 1 and subtract 1 from `lex`, which can lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `lex` is exactly 52 correctly, as it would append two 26s and then a 0, which is not a valid letter index.
