The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `func` and `n` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
