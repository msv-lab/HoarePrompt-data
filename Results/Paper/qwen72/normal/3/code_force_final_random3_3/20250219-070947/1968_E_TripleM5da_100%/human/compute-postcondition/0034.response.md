The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function is designed to handle a series of test cases. The function is expected to process `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. For each test case, the function processes an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the example.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3, and returns a result for each test case.**
