Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the `print` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Output: **2, 2**
