Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 50, inclusive. For each of the `t` test cases, the variable `n` is still an integer within the range 2 to 10^3, inclusive. The loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `n` for each test case, meaning that the loop has completed its iterations for each `n` provided in the input. The loop prints the pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (i, i) for each `i` from 3 to `n` for each test case.
