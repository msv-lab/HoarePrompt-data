The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be within the specified range.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `n` must still be such that 3 <= n <= 10^3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 1**
