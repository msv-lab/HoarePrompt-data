To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1)`, which means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the input integer (which must be greater than 0)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(3, n + 1)` is not empty. This means `n + 1` must be greater than 3, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0, but it will be set to 3 by the loop itself on the first iteration. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` in the initial state.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0**
