The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `i` is within the range defined by `range(0, int(input()))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be reset to 0 and the upper limit of the range, `int(input())`, must be greater than `n`.

However, the loop head does not allow for the direct modification of `n` or the input value. The loop variable `i` is automatically managed by the loop, so it will be reset to 0 at the start of the loop. The condition for the loop to execute again is that the input value must be greater than `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than `n`**
