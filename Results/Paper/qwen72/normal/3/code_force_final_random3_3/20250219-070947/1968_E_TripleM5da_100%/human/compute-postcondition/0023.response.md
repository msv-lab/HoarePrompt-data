Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer greater than the initial value of `n`, `i` is 0.** 

The value of `n` is updated to a new integer that is greater than the initial value of `n`, which was between 3 and 10^3. The value of `t` remains within its initial range, and `i` remains 0.
