You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `N-1`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: `i` is `N`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`, and `t` is the number of unique elements in `cnt` that have a count of 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program returns `i`. Otherwise, the program does not return and the state remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to a new array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c` to increase the MEX.
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from including elements that would increase the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N` to determine the MEX.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of elements that appear exactly once in `a`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if the current element `i` does not appear in `a`, the function returns `i` as the MEX.

4. **Correctness of the Strategy**:
   - The key insight is that if an element appears exactly once in `a`, Alice can always choose it to include in `c` on her turn.
   - Bob can only remove elements that appear more than once or elements that are not chosen by Alice.
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once and has been chosen by Alice twice (which is not possible since Alice and Bob take turns).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains all integers from 0 to `N-1` exactly once.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players.
   - It correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
