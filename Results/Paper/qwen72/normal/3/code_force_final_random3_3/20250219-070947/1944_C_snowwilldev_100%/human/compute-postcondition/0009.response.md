Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will have the value `N-1`, which is the last index of the list `a` that was processed.
- The variable `N` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- The `cnt` dictionary will have incremented the count for each element in the list `a` by 1, where the key is the element at index `j` in the list `a`, and `j` ranges from `0` to `N-1`.
