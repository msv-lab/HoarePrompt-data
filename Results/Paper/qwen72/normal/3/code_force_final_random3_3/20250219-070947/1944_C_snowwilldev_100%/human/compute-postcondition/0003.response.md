The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(N)`. The other states (`a`, `t`, and `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be greater than 0**
