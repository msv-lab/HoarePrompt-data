The function `func_1` is described with a specific context involving parameters and constraints, but the provided function signature does not include these parameters. Based on the given context, the function should accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, and it should handle multiple test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases. However, the function signature provided is incomplete, and the output cases do not directly correlate with the parameters or constraints given.

Given the constraints and the output cases, I will assume the function signature should be `def func_1(a, n, t):` and describe the functionality based on the provided output cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The function returns different integer values based on the test cases: Case_1: If the conditions for the test case are met, the function returns 0. Case_2: If the conditions for the test case are met, the function returns 1. Case_3: If the conditions for the test case are met, the function returns 2.** 

Note: The specific conditions for each case are not provided in the function signature or the constraints, so the functionality is described based on the output cases given.
