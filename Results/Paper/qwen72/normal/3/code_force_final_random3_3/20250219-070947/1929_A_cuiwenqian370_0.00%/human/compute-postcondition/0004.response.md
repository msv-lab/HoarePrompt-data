To determine if the `while` loop can execute the first time, we need to evaluate the condition in the loop head: `left <= right`.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

Let's analyze the condition `left <= right`:
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute the first time, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, the condition `left <= right` will be true as long as `n - 1` is non-negative, which is always true for `n` in the range 2 <= n <= 100.

Since the condition `left <= right` is already satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
