The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 2 and `right` is `n - 3`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. Since `left` is 2, `right` must be at least 2 for the condition `left <= right` to hold true. Therefore, `right` must be adjusted to ensure it is at least 2.

However, since `right` is already defined as `n - 3`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, for `right` to be at least 2, `n` must be at least 5 (because `5 - 3 = 2`). 

Thus, the state of `right` does not need to be explicitly adjusted; it is already in a state that can satisfy the loop condition given the constraints on `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`**
