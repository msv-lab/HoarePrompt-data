### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty, and we need to find the maximum possible beauty.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
   - This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is a good starting point because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
   - **Constructing the New Array**:
     - The program uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to select elements from the sorted array.
     - It alternates between appending the largest (`arr[right]`) and smallest (`arr[left]`) elements to the new array.
     - If `left` and `right` are the same, it appends the single remaining element.
   - **Calculating the Beauty**:
     - The program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.
     - The absolute difference is used to ensure that the differences are always positive, which is necessary for maximizing the beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The problem guarantees that `n` is at least 2, so this case is not applicable.
   - **All Elements are the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty will be 0, which is correct.
   - **Mixed Elements**: The alternating approach ensures that the largest and smallest differences are used, which should maximize the beauty.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and multiple test cases.
   - The logic for constructing the new array and calculating the beauty is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - However, the problem specifically asks for the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` without the absolute value. The provided program uses `abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` which is incorrect for this problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses the absolute value of the differences, which is not required by the problem statement. The problem asks for the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` directly, and using the absolute value can lead to incorrect results.

### Example:
For the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`. The new array constructed by the program is `[3, 1, 2]`. The beauty calculated by the program is:
```
abs(3 - 1) + abs(1 - 2) = 2 + 1 = 3
```
However, the correct beauty should be:
```
(3 - 1) + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1
```
This shows that the program does not produce the correct result for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
