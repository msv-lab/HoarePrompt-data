Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1]) + abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3.**

The value of `max_beauty` is updated by adding the absolute difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `new_arr` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.
