You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.

    return max_beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the mirrored list `new_arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `arr` and then constructs a new list `new_arr` by placing the elements in a mirrored order: starting from the last element and then the first element, followed by the second-to-last element and then the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be the last element in `new_arr`. The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty, and we need to find the maximum possible beauty.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
   - This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is a good starting point because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
   - **Constructing the New Array**:
     - The program uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to select elements from the sorted array.
     - It alternates between appending the largest (`arr[right]`) and smallest (`arr[left]`) elements to the new array.
     - If `left` and `right` are the same, it appends the single remaining element.
   - **Calculating the Beauty**:
     - The program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.
     - The absolute difference is used to ensure that the differences are always positive, which is necessary for maximizing the beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The problem guarantees that `n` is at least 2, so this case is not applicable.
   - **All Elements are the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty will be 0, which is correct.
   - **Mixed Elements**: The alternating approach ensures that the largest and smallest differences are used, which should maximize the beauty.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and multiple test cases.
   - The logic for constructing the new array and calculating the beauty is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should produce the maximum beauty for the given array in all valid cases.

Correctness: **True**
