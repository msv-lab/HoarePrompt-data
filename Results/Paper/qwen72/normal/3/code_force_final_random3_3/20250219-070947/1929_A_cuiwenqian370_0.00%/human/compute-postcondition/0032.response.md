Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_beauty` is updated by adding `abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])` to its previous value `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
