Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`, `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[n - 3]` and `arr[2]`.**

The code appends the element at index `left` (which is 2) of the list `arr` to `new_arr`. Initially, `new_arr` contained the element at index `n - 3` of `arr`. After the code execution, `new_arr` now contains both the element at index `n - 3` and the element at index 2 of `arr`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
