Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`, `new_arr` contains the element `arr[n - 3]`**. 

The value of `right` is `n - 3`, and the element at `arr[right]` (which is `arr[n - 3]`) is appended to `new_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
