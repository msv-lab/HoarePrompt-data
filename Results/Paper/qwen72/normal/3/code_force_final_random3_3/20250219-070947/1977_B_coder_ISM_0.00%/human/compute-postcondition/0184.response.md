Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `x` is an input integer.
- `t` is greater than 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `nalla` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `i` is 30 (reinitialized by the loop).
- `length` is 30 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial state (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. Each string in `s` is '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set, and '0' otherwise.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*s)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(*s)` statement will print the elements of the list `s` separated by spaces.
- Each element in `s` is a string that represents whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set or not.
- The list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0' based on the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of 30 strings, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x` in reverse order (i.e., the least significant bit first and the most significant bit last).

Output: **[30 strings, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` in reverse order]**
