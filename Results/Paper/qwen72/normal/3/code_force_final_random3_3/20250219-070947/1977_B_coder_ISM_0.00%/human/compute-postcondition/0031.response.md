Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from position 0 to 29). If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1, the string at position `i` in `s` is '1'. Otherwise, it is '0'. `flag` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` remains '1'. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
