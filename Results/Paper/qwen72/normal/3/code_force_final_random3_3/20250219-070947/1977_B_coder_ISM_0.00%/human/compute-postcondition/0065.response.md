Postcondition: ***`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. The list `s` will have been modified such that any consecutive '1's will be replaced with '-1' and '1' respectively, and any '0' that follows a '-1' will be set to '1'. The `flag` will be 0 if the last bit checked was not part of a consecutive '1' sequence, or 1 if it was. Additionally, if `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` is a list containing 31 strings, where `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1'. Otherwise, `length` remains 30, and either `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'.***
