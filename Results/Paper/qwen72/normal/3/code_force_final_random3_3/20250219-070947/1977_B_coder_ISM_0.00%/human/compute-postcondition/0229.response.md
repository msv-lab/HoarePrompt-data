Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. `s` is a list containing 30 strings, where each string represents the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. If `flag` is 1, then `s[29]` is set to '1' and `flag` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the state of `s` and `flag` remains unchanged.***
