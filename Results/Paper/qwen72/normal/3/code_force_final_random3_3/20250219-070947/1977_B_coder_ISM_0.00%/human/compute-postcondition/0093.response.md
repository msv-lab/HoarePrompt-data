The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the implicit `range(30)`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than 30. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than 30.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` (which is 2) is non-zero, `s` contains '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains '0'.**
