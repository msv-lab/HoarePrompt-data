The function `func` reads a number `t` from the user, indicating how many times the main operation should be performed. For each iteration, it reads a positive integer `x` (1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) and converts it into a binary string representation of length 30. It then processes this binary string to replace certain patterns: any '1' followed by another '1' is replaced with '-1' and '0', and any '-1' immediately following a '1' is replaced with '0' and '-1'. If a carry (`flag`) is set at the end of the processing and the last bit is '0', it is changed to '1'. If the carry is set and the last bit is '1', an additional '1' is appended to the list, increasing its length to 31. The function prints the initial binary string, the final length, and the processed binary string for each input `x`. The function does not return any value.
