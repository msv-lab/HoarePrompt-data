Postcondition: ***`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[2]` is modified to '-1'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
