Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `s` is a list containing one element '0', `length` is 30, `i` is 0, and the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` is 0.**

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string '0' to the list `s`, which was initially empty. Therefore, `s` now contains one element, '0'. The values of `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` is 0 still holds true.
