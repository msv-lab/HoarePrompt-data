Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 31, `s` is a list containing 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29, and an additional '1' appended at index 30. The loop has processed the list `s` from index 0 to index 28. If `flag` was 1 and `s[i + 1]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` was 1 and `s[i + 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '0', `s[i + 1]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` was 0, `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` remain unchanged, and `flag` is 0. Additionally, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '0'.***
