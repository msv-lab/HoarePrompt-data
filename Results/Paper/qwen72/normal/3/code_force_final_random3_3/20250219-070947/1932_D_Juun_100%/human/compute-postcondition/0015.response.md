Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is an empty list, `rank` is the first character of the string `card`, `suit` is the second character of the string `card`, and `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list containing a single string which is the result of joining two sorted two-character strings, where the first string is the value of `suits[suit]` and the second string is `rank` followed by `suit`, and the value for the key `suit` in `suits` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `answers` remains an empty list and the value of `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.**
