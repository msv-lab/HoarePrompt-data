Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`n`**: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16.
2. **`trump_suit`**: A character from "CDHS" representing the trump suit.
3. **`cards`**: A list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS".
4. **`trump`**: An input string, which is likely the same as `trump_suit` (though not explicitly stated, it is a reasonable assumption).
5. **`trumps`**: A sorted list of trump cards in descending order, containing at least one element.
6. **`suits`**: A dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value set to a non-`None` value.
7. **`answers`**: A list containing strings, each of which represents a pair of cards where the first card is a non-trump card with the same suit as the key in the `suits` dictionary and the second card is a trump card, sorted by their ranks and joined with a space.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`. Since `trumps` is sorted in descending order, the first `trumps.pop()` will return the highest-ranked trump card.
2. **`trump`**: This is the trump suit, which is likely the same as `trump_suit`.
3. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method is called again, removing and returning the second highest-ranked trump card from the list `trumps`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the two highest-ranked trump cards in the `trumps` list, each followed by the trump suit.

Since the exact values of `trumps` and `trump` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the highest and second highest trump cards.

Output: **[highest_trump_card][trump] [second_highest_trump_card][trump] (where [highest_trump_card] and [second_highest_trump_card] are the highest and second highest ranked trump cards in the `trumps` list, and [trump] is the trump suit)**
