Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` remains an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that now contains a single string which is the concatenation of `rank` and `suit` in sorted order, separated by a space. Otherwise, the value of the key `suit` in `suits` is set to `rank`, and `answers` is a list that may contain a single string or remain empty. `card` is the next element in the list generated by `input().split()`.***
