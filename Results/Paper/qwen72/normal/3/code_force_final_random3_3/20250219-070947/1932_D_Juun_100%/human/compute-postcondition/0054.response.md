The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`. The initial state describes various variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
