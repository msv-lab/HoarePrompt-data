Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from input, `v` is `v - 1` and must be greater than 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + min(custo_pra_trocar_a[v], custo_pra_passar_b[v])`, and `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding the smaller value between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.***
