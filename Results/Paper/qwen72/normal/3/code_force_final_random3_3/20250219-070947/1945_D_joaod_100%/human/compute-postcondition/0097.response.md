Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final` + 1, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`; otherwise, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number.**

Explanation:
- The code `custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
- The initial state specifies that `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, and this code snippet updates `custo_pra_trocar_a` to a new list of integers read from the input.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
