Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\).
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
4. `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).
5. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
6. `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
7. `c` is 1.
8. `na_frente` must be at least 0.
9. `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2.
10. `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input.
11. `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input.
12. `v` is -1.
13. `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0.
14. `best` is the minimum value of `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final` + 1, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`; otherwise, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`na_frente` and `pos_final`**:
   - `na_frente` is at least 0.
   - `pos_final` is calculated as the second integer from the input minus 2. This means `pos_final` is a non-negative integer or zero, depending on the input.

2. **`total` Calculation**:
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0.
   - If `na_frente` is 0, `total` will be the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.
   - If `na_frente` is greater than 0, `total` will be the sum of the minimum values from `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]` to `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]` to `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.

3. **`best` Calculation**:
   - `best` is initialized to the maximum representable floating-point number.
   - For each `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final` + 1, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is updated to the minimum of the current `best` and `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number.

### Final Output:
The `print(best)` statement will print the minimum value of `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final` + 1, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If no such `v` exists, it will print the maximum representable floating-point number.

Since the exact values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `best`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `best`.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for all v from na_frente to pos_final + 1, if v is less than or equal to pos_final; otherwise, best is the maximum representable floating-point number)**
