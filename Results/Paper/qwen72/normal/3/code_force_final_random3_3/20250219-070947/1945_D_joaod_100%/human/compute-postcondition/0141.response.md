Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `na_frente` must be at least 0.
   - `v` is -1.
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0.
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `na_frente` is a non-negative integer.
   - `v` is a fixed integer value of -1.
   - `total` is calculated as the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` down to 0.
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` down to 0, but only considering `i` values that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.

3. **Execution of the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print(best)` statement will output the value of `best`.
   - `best` is determined by the formula provided in the initial state, which involves the sum `total` and the values in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.

Since the exact values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `best`. However, we can describe the value of `best` based on the given information.

**Output:**
**best (where best is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0)**
