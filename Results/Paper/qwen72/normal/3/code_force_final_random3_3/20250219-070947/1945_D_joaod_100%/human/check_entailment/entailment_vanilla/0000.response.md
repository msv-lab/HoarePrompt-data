### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `na_frente` and the desired position `pos_final`.
   - It then reads the costs `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each person in the queue.
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is correct because the problem uses 1-based indexing.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost.
   - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max`, which will be used to track the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.

3. **Iterating Through the Queue:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning using a reverse loop (`for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1)`).
   - For each person `v` in the queue:
     - If `v` is within the range of the desired position `pos_final`:
       - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with person `v` is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
       - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is not within the range of the desired position:
       - It simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all people in the queue, the program prints the minimum cost `best` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic for updating `best` and `total` is sound. It ensures that Kirill spends the minimum number of coins to reach a position within the first `m` people.
- The use of `sys.float_info.max` to initialize `best` ensures that the initial value is higher than any possible cost, allowing the program to find the minimum cost correctly.
- The program efficiently iterates through the queue in reverse, which is necessary to ensure that Kirill can make the optimal decision at each step.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately and follows the logic required to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` people.

### Correctness:
**True**
