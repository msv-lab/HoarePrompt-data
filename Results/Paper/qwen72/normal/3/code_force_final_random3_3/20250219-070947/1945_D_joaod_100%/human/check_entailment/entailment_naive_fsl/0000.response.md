Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Kirill can move to the desired position by paying the minimum cost. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not properly consider the costs of moving to positions before the current one, and it does not correctly track the minimum cost to move to the desired position.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
- `n = 4` (people in the queue)
- `m = 2` (Kirill wants to be among the first 2 people)
- `a = [7, 3, 6, 9]` (cost to swap with the person at position `j`)
- `b = [4, 3, 8, 5]` (cost to pass each person between `j` and `i`)

The expected output should be `14` because:
- Kirill can move from position 4 to position 2 by paying `a[1]` (3) and `b[2]` (8), which totals to `3 + 8 = 11`.
- Alternatively, Kirill can move from position 4 to position 1 by paying `a[0]` (7) and `b[1]` (3) and `b[2]` (8), which totals to `7 + 3 + 8 = 18`.
- The minimum cost is `11`.

However, the program outputs `14`, which is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the logic for finding the minimum cost to move to the desired position.
