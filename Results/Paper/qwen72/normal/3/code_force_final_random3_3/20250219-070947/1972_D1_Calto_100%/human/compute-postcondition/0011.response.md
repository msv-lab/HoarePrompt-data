Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0), `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 6`, `y` is 9, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `i * i`, where `i` is 3. Therefore, `y` becomes 9.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid.
