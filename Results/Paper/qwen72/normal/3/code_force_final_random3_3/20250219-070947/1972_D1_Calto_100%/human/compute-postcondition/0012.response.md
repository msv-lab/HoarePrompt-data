Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 6`, `y` is 9, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0) + math.ceil((n - 6) / 9) + ((n - 6) % 9 == 0).**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and `(x % y == 0)` to its current value.
- `x` is `n - 6` and `y` is 9.
- `math.ceil(x / y)` computes the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`.
- `(x % y == 0)` checks if `x` is divisible by `y`, adding 1 to `cnt` if true, otherwise adding 0.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
