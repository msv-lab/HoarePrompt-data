Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns an integer `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is calculated as the sum of a specific expression for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`, minus 1. Specifically, for each `i`, the expression is `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)`. The final state of the program is that `cnt` holds this computed value, while `n` and `m` remain unchanged. **
