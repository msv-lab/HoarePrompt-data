### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). This function is correct and works as intended.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The function initializes `cnt` to -1, which is unusual and suggests an off-by-one error.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x` as \(n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and `y` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It then increments `cnt` by \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil + (x \% y == 0)\).

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The formula used inside the loop is not directly derived from the problem statement. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation does not correctly check this condition. Instead, it seems to be using a different formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The initialization of `cnt` to -1 is also incorrect. It should start at 0 to avoid an off-by-one error.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\). The function should return 1, but due to the initialization of `cnt` to -1, it will return 0.
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\), the valid pairs are \((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)\). The function should return 14, but the current implementation will not correctly count these pairs due to the incorrect formula and initialization.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The formula used in `func_2` and the initialization of `cnt` are both problematic.

Correctness: **False**
