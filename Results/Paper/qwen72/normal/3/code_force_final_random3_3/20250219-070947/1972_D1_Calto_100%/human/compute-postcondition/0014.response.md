Output State: **The program returns the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as -1 plus the sum of (math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)) for each `i` from 1 to `m`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and `i` is initialized to `m`.**
