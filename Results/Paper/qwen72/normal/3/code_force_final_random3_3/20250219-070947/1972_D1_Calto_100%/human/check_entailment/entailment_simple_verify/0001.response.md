### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is correct and can be used to find \(\gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The logic in the function is:
     - Initialize `cnt` to \(-1\).
     - Iterate over \(i\) from \(1\) to \(m\).
     - For each \(i\), calculate \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
     - Update `cnt` by adding \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) and an additional \(1\) if \(x \% y == 0\).
     - Return `cnt`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The problem requires that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_2` does not use the GCD function `func_1` to check the condition.
   - The formula \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) does not seem to directly relate to the problem's condition.
   - The logic of adding \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) and an additional \(1\) if \(x \% y == 0\) does not align with the requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\):
     - The only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), which satisfies \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
     - The function `func_2` should return \(1\), but it returns \(0\) because `cnt` is initialized to \(-1\) and the loop increments it by \(1\).
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\):
     - The valid pairs are \((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)\).
     - The function `func_2` should return \(14\), but it returns a different value because the logic does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem. The function `func_2` is not correctly counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem's conditions. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the function `func_2`.

Final: **False**
