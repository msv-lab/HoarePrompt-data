The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1, and `i` starts at 1. The state of `cnt` is not relevant to the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, and `i` must start at 1. Given that `n` and `m` are already positive integers within the specified range, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure `i` starts at 1, which is already the case in the loop statement.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0**
