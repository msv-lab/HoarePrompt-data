Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0), `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 6`, `y` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`.
- Given `i` is 3, `i * i - i` is `3 * 3 - 3` which equals 6.
- Therefore, `x` is now `n - 6`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
