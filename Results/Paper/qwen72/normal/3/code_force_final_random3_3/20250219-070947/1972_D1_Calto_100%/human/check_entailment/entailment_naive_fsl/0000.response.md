Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The issue lies in the logic of `func_2`:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic used in the program seems to be attempting to count pairs in a different manner, but it does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where \(a\) and \(b\) are both 1 correctly. The correct output for the pair (1, 1) should be 1, but the program's logic might not produce this result consistently.

3. **General Logic Error**:
   - The program does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:

- For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). The program should output 4, but it does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
