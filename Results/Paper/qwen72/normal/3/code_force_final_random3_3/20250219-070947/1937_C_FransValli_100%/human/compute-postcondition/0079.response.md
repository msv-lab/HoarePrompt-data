The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `res` is the new input provided by the user. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `res` is the new input provided by the user. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains unchanged.**
