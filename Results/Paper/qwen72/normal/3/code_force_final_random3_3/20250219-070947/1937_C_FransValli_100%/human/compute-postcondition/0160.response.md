Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]` if `res` is not `=`, or `[0, 1]` if `res` is `=`.***
