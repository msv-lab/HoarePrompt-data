Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses.
   - `res` is the last input string.
   - `arr` is `[0]`.
   - `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses. Since the exact input responses are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `maxi`, but we know it is an integer.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`, which is explicitly given as `0`.
   - `maxi` is printed again.
   - `i` is explicitly given as `1`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1`.
   - Since `maxi` is an integer, the output will be `? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1` where `[maxi]` is the value of `maxi`.

Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where [maxi] is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses)**
