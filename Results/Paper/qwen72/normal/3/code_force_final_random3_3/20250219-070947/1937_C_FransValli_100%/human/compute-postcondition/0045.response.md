Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop's execution.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state requires that the input integer `n` is greater than 0.
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- During each iteration, the loop prints a query and reads a response `res`.
- If `res` is '<', `arr` is updated to contain only the current value of `i`.
- If `res` is '=', the current value of `i` is appended to `arr`.
- If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is not updated.
- The variable `maxi` is updated to the largest value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The final state of `arr` will be a list of all integers `i` for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop's execution.
- The final state of `maxi` will be the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
