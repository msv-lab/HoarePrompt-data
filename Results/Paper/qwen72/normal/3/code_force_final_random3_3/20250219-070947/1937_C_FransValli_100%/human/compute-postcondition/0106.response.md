Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string, `arr` is `[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` to `arr`.
- The value of `i` is 3, so `arr` becomes `[3]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `res` (if `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[2]`; if `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`; if `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0]`) are no longer relevant because `arr` is explicitly set to `[3]`.
