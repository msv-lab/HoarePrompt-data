Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- **`maxi`**: `maxi` will be the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses. If no `<` was ever input, `maxi` will remain `0`.
- **`res`**: `res` will be the last input string received during the loop.
- **`arr`**: The array `arr` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`mini`**: `mini` remains the smallest index for which the input was '>', or `0` if no such index exists, as it is not modified within the loop.
