Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is [1], `res` is the input string, and `res` is equal to '<'.**

The code snippet `arr = [i]` updates the value of `arr` to a list containing the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
