Postcondition: ***`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=' and must have at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. If `res` is not '>', `mini` remains the first element of `arr`. `res` is the new input value.***
