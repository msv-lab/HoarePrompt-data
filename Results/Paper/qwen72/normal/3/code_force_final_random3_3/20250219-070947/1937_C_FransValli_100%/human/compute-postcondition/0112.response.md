To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of `arr` and the index used in the loop head, which is `1:`. The loop will only execute if `arr` has at least one element beyond the first index. Let's break down the conditions:

1. **If `res` is '<':**
   - `arr` is `[n-1]`.
   - This means `arr` has only one element, so `arr[1:]` will be an empty list, and the loop will not execute.

2. **If `res` is '=':**
   - `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
   - This means `arr` has `n` elements, so `arr[1:]` will have `n-1` elements, and the loop will execute.

3. **If `res` is not '<' and not '=':**
   - `arr` is `[0]`.
   - This means `arr` has only one element, so `arr[1:]` will be an empty list, and the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least two elements. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `arr` has at least two elements. The only way to guarantee this is if `res` is '=' and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is '=', `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is 0**
