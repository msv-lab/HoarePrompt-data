Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is [0].**

The code snippet initializes the list `arr` to contain a single element, 0. The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `arr` being set to [0].
