The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.**
