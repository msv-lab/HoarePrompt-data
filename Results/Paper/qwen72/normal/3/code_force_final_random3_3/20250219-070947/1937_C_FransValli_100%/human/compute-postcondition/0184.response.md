Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - `mini` is `arr[1]` if `res` is `'>`', otherwise `mini` is `arr[0]`.
   - `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`, and `arr` must have at least three elements.
   - `item` is the third element in `arr`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mini` is determined based on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `'>`', then `mini` is `arr[1]`.
     - If `res` is anything else, then `mini` is `arr[0]`.
   - `item` is the third element in `arr`, which is `arr[2]`.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'` followed by the values of `mini` and `item` repeated twice.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
- If `res` is `'>`', then `mini` is `arr[1]`.
- If `res` is anything else, then `mini` is `arr[0]`.
- `item` is `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is `arr[1]` if `res` is `'>`', otherwise `arr[0]`, and [item] is the third element in `arr`)**
