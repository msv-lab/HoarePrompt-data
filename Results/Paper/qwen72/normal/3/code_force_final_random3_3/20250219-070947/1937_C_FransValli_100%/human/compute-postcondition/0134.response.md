Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the last input string.
   - `arr` is a list containing integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i`.
   - Since `maxi` is 0 and `i` is 1, the output will be:
     ```
     ? 0 0 1 1
     ```

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console without any buffering.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
