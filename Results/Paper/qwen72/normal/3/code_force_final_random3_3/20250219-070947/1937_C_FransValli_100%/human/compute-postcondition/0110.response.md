Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the last input string. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[n-1]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0]`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`maxi`**: The variable `maxi` remains `0` throughout the loop unless `res` is ever '<' during any iteration. However, since `maxi` is only updated if `res` is '<', and the problem does not specify that `res` is ever '<', we assume `maxi` remains `0`.
- **`res`**: `res` is the last input string received during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`arr`**: The final state of `arr` depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is '<' during the last iteration, `arr` will be `[n-1]`.
  - If `res` is '=' during any iteration, `arr` will be `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
  - If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` will remain `[0]`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
