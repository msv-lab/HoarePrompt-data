Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[n-2]` which is now `1000000000 - arr[n-2]`, `i` is `n - 2`.** 

The code snippet updates the element at index `n-2` in the list `ans` to be the result of subtracting the element at index `n-2` in the list `arr` from the element at index `n-1` in the list `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans[i + 1]` is 1000000000, the new value of `ans[n-2]` is `1000000000 - arr[n-2]`. All other elements in `ans` remain 1000000000, and the values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
