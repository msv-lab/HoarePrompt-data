Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[n-2]` which is now `1000000000 - arr[n-2]` and `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` which is now `ans[i + 2] - arr[i + 1]`, `i` is `n - 6`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[n-2]` which is `1000000000 - arr[n-2]`.
- The code snippet `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the values of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`.
- Since `i` is `n - 6`, the value of `ans[n - 6]` is updated to `ans[n - 5] - arr[n - 6]`.
- The previous value of `ans[n - 5]` was `ans[n - 4] - arr[n - 5]`, and this value is used to update `ans[n - 6]`.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
