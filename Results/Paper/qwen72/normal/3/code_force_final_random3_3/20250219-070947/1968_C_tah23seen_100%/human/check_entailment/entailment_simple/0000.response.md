### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` of length `n-1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It then iterates backward from `n-2` to `0` and sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of the array `ans` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The goal is to find an array `a` such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).
   - The function `func_1` sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This means that \( a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i \).
   - For the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) to hold, \( a_i \) must be less than \( a_{i-1} \) and the difference \( a_{i-1} - a_i \) must be equal to \( x_i \).
   - The initial value of \( a_n \) is set to \(10^9\), which is a large number. This ensures that \( a_{i-1} \) is always greater than \( a_i \) when \( a_i \) is calculated as \( a_{i+1} - x_i \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints \( 2 \le n \le 500 \) and \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \) correctly.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that \( a_i \) is always a positive integer because \( a_{i+1} \) is \(10^9\) and \( x_i \) is at most 500, so \( a_i \) will always be at least \(10^9 - 500\), which is still a large positive number.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case with `arr = [2, 4, 1]` and `n = 4`:
     - `ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`
     - After processing:
       - `ans[2] = ans[3] - arr[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`
       - `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995`
       - `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993`
     - The output is `999999993 999999995 999999999 1000000000`.
     - This satisfies the conditions:
       - \( 999999995 \bmod 999999993 = 2 \)
       - \( 999999999 \bmod 999999995 = 4 \)
       - \( 1000000000 \bmod 999999999 = 1 \)

However, the program does not always produce the correct output. For example, if `arr = [1, 1]` and `n = 3`, the output should be something like `2 3 4` (where \(3 \bmod 2 = 1\) and \(4 \bmod 3 = 1\)). The current implementation will produce `999999998 999999999 1000000000`, which does not satisfy the conditions because \(999999999 \bmod 999999998 = 1\) but \(1000000000 \bmod 999999999 = 1\), which is correct, but the initial values are not optimal and can lead to incorrect results in other cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not always produce a correct array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. The approach of setting `a_i` to `a_{i+1} - x_i` can lead to values that are too large and do not necessarily satisfy the modulo conditions correctly. A better approach would be to start with a smaller initial value and ensure that the modulo conditions are met.
