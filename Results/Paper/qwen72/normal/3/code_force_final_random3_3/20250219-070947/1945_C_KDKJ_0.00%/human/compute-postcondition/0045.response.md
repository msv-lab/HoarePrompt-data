Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`. If `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
