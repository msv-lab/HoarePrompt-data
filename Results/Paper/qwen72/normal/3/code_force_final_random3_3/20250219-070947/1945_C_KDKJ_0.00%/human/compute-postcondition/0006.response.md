Output State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer, `_` is `int(input()) - 1`, `func_1()` has been called `int(input())` times.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `int(input())` must have been a positive integer, the loop variable `_` will be equal to `int(input()) - 1`, and the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `int(input())` times.
