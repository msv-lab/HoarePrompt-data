Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists. Each sublist in `S` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point. The final sublist in `S` will contain the total counts of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`. `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0.**
