Output State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer, `_` is 1, `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code snippet `func_1()` calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function does not return any value or modify any variables, the state of the program remains unchanged. The initial conditions that `int(input())` must return a positive integer and `_` is 1 are still valid. Additionally, `func_1()` has been called, which is part of the new state.
