Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `rsum = n - lsum` updates the value of `rsum`.
- `lsum` is defined as `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`.
- Therefore, `rsum` is updated to `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, `satisfy`, `left`, `right`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions for `n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, and `ans` are still valid.
