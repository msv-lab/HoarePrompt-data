The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute if `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `int(input())` must return a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still return a positive integer that is greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer, `_` is 1, `func_1()` has been called.**
