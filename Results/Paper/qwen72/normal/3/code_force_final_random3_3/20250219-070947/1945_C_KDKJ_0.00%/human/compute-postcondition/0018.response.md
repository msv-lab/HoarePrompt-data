The code snippet `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the values of the last sublist in `S` to `x` and `y`. The last sublist in `S` is `[x, y]`, which means `x` and `y` are being assigned their own values. This operation does not change the values of `x` and `y`, but it does confirm that `x` and `y` are the values from the last sublist in `S`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least three characters.
- `s` is the third character of `a`.
- If `s` is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 0.
- If `s` is '1', `x` is 0 and `y` is 2.
- `S` is a list containing three sublists: `[0, 0]`, `[x, y]`, and `[x, y]`.

The output state is:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least three characters.
- `s` is the third character of `a`.
- If `s` is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 0.
- If `s` is '1', `x` is 0 and `y` is 2.
- `S` is a list containing three sublists: `[0, 0]`, `[x, y]`, and `[x, y]`.

Since `x` and `y` are reassigned to their own values, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least three characters, `s` is the third character of `a`, if `s` is '0' then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if `s` is '1' then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, `S` is a list containing three sublists: `[0, 0]`, `[x, y]`, and `[x, y]`.**
