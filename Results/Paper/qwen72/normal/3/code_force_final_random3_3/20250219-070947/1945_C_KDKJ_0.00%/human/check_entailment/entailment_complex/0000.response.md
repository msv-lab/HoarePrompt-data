### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Input:** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - **Cumulative Counts (`S`):** The function constructs a list `S` where each element is a sublist `[x, y]` representing the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to the current position in the string `a`.
   - **Condition Checking:** The function iterates through each possible position `i` to place the road and checks if the conditions for the left and right sides are satisfied:
     - `left * 2 >= lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
     - `right * 2 >= rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
   - **Minimizing Distance:** If the conditions are met, the function updates `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to `n / 2` than the previously stored position.
   - **Output:** The function prints the position `ans` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Input:** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - **Test Case Handling:** For each test case, the function calls `func_1` to solve the problem for that specific case.
   - **Output:** The function does not directly output anything; it relies on `func_1` to print the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Cumulative Count Construction:** The construction of the cumulative count list `S` is correct and efficiently done in a single pass through the string `a`.
- **Condition Checking:** The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are correctly implemented to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- **Minimizing Distance:** The logic to find the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` while satisfying the conditions is also correct.
- **Test Case Handling:** The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
