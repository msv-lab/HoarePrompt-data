Initial State: `int(input())` must return a positive integer, `_` is 0
```
func_1()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The function `func_1()` is called. However, without the definition of `func_1()`, it is impossible to determine its exact impact on the variables or the program state. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must return a positive integer, but this input is not used in the provided code snippet. The variable `_` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer, `_` is 0, `func_1()` has been called.**
