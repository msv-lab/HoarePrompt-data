Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least two characters, `s` is the second character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` is updated to 2 and `y` is updated to 0. If `s` is '1', `x` is updated to 0 and `y` is updated to 2. In both cases, `S` is a list containing two sublists: `[0, 0]` and `[x, y]`.***
