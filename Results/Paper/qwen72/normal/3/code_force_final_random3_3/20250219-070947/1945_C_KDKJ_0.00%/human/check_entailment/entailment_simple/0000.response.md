### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the string `a` of length `n`.

2. **Cumulative Count Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`.
   - `S` is initialized with a single sublist `[0, 0]` to handle the case where the road is laid before the first house.
   - For each character `s` in the string `a`, it updates the cumulative counts and appends the new counts to `S`.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program iterates through each possible position `i` where the road can be laid (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the left side's total houses and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the right side's total houses.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village than the previously stored answer.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the position `ans` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The condition `left * 2 < lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
- The condition `right * 2 < rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
- The program correctly updates `ans` to the position that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the above conditions.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases where the road is laid before the first house or after the last house by including these positions in the loop and the cumulative count list `S`.
- The program also correctly handles the case where the entire village is declared to be either the left or right side.

### Correctness:
- The program follows the problem description accurately.
- It correctly calculates the cumulative counts and checks the conditions for each possible position.
- It updates the answer to the position that is closest to the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.
