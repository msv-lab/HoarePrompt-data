Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It computes and prints an index `ans` that represents the position in the string `a` where the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the index meet specific balance conditions. Specifically, the index `ans` is chosen such that the number of '0's on the left side is at least half the total characters on the left, and the number of '1's on the right side is at least half the total characters on the right. The function prints the index `ans` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies these conditions. If no such index exists, the function will print the closest valid index to `n / 2`. **
