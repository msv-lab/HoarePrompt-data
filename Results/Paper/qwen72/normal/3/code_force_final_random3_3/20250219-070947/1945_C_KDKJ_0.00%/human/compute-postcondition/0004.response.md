The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must return a positive integer, `_` is 1, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `int(input())` must still be a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `func_1()` has been called.**
