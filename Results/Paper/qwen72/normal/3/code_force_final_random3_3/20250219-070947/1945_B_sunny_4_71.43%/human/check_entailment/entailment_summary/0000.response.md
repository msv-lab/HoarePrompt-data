Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time, given the launch frequencies `a` and `b` and the visibility duration `m + 1` minutes for each firework.

The provided program calculates the number of distinct moments when at least one firework is visible for each installation, and then sums these values. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap in visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. The program simply calculates the number of fireworks launched within the first `m + 1` minutes and adds them together, which can lead to overcounting.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Visibility Periods**: Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes. We need to find the maximum number of overlapping visibility periods.
2. **Overlap Calculation**: We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time by considering the launch times and their visibility periods.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the first time when both installations launch a firework simultaneously. Then, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that can be visible at the same time within the visibility period `m + 1`.

The provided program does not handle the overlap correctly and will produce incorrect results for many test cases. For example, in the third test case (7, 8, 56), the program calculates `A = 9` and `B = 8`, and prints `17`. However, the correct answer is `17` because the fireworks from both installations can overlap in their visibility periods, and the program should account for this overlap.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
