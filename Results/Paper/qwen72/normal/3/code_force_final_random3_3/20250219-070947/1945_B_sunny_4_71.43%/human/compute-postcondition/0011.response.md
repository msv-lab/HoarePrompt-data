The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**
