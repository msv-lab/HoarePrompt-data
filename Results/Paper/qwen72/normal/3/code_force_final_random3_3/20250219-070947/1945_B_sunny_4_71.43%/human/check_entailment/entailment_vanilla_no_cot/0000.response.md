Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of a single firework, but it does not account for the overlap of visibility periods between fireworks launched from different installations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at any given minute, considering the visibility period of each firework and the launch intervals of both installations. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap of launch times and then calculating the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        for time in range(l):
            count = 0
            if (time + m + 1) // a - time // a > 0:
                count += (time + m + 1) // a - time // a
            if (time + m + 1) // b - time // b > 0:
                count += (time + m + 1) // b - time // b
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at any minute by iterating through the least common multiple of `a` and `b` and counting the number of fireworks launched from each installation that are visible at each minute within the visibility period.
