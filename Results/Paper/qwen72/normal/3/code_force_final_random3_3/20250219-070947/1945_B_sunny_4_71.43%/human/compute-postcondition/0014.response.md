Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned new integer values from the input, `t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.**

The code snippet `B = int(m / b) + 1` reassigns the value of `B` to `int(m / b) + 1`. Since `B` was already defined as `int(m / b) + 1` in the initial state, the value of `B` remains unchanged. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, `_`, and `A`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
