The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 2, `possible` is False**
