Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`. If any character in `a` is equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is different, or if any character in `a` is not equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is not equal to either `a` or `b`, then `possible` is set to True. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1` (the last index of the input strings). The variable `possible` will be True if, at any point during the iterations, either:
1. A character in `a` matches the corresponding character in `b`, and the corresponding character in `c` is different from both `a` and `b`.
2. A character in `a` does not match the corresponding character in `b`, and the corresponding character in `c` is different from both `a` and `b`.

If neither of these conditions is met for any character in the strings, `possible` will remain False.
