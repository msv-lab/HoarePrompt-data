The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 1, if the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a` and `b`, `possible` is set to True. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` remains False. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True.**
