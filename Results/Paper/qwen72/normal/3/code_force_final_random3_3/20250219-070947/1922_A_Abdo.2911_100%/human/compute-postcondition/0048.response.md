Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is set to True or remains False based on the conditions described.**

The code snippet `b = input().strip()` updates the value of `b` to the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged.
