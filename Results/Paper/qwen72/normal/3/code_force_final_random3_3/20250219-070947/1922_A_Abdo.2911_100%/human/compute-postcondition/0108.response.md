Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is set by the loop. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
