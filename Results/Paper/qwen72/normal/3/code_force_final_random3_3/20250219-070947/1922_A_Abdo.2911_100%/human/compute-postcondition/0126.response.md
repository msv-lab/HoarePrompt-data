Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]`, the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
