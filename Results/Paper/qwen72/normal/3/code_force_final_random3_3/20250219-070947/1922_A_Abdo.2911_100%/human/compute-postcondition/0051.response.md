The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1` and `possible` is False, but these do not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 0 and set `i` to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 0, `possible` is False**
