Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 1, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
