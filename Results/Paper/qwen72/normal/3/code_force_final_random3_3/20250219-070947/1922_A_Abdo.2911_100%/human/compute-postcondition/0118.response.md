The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is unchanged if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

However, since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n`:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
