Precondition: **The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. It should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` vertices. The parameters should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the list of vertices should contain `x` distinct integers from 1 to n.**
