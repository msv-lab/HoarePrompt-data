Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus 1, `tmp` is a list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and the difference between the first element of `a` and `a[len(a) - 1]` plus `n` is exactly 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`, and the condition involving `n`) remain unchanged.
