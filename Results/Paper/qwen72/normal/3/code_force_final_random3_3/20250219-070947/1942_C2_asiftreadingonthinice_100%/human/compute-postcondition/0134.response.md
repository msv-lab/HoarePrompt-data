Postcondition: ***`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2, and the difference between `a[0] + n` and `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.***
