Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`. `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition. `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not an even number, otherwise `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` must be greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer.***
