### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is correct based on the problem statement.
   - It reads the number of test cases `tt` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` vertices.

2. **Sorting the Vertices:**
   - The vertices `a` are sorted, which is necessary to correctly calculate the differences between consecutive vertices.

3. **Initial Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is a good starting point because each chosen vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and we need to account for the maximum number of vertices we can use.

4. **Handling Consecutive Vertices:**
   - The function checks the differences between consecutive vertices in the sorted list `a`:
     - If the difference is 2, it means there is exactly one vertex between them, which can be used to form a triangle. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 1.
     - If the difference is an even number greater than 2, it means there are multiple vertices between them, and the function appends half of this difference to the list `tmp`.

5. **Handling the Wrap-Around Case:**
   - The function also checks the difference between the first and last vertices in the list `a` (considering the polygon is cyclic):
     - If the difference is 2, it increments `ans` by 1.
     - If the difference is an even number greater than 2, it appends half of this difference to the list `tmp`.

6. **Processing `tmp` to Maximize `ans`:**
   - The list `tmp` is sorted, and the function iterates over it to add as many vertices as possible to `ans` without exceeding the limit `y`.
   - For each value in `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it adds `i` to `ans` and decrements `y` by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, it breaks out of the loop.

7. **Final Adjustment and Output:**
   - The function adds any remaining `y` to `ans` and ensures that `ans` does not exceed `n - 2` (the maximum number of triangles that can be formed in a polygon with `n` sides).
   - It then prints the final value of `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
- It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake based on the given vertices and the additional vertices that can be chosen.
- The logic for handling the differences between consecutive vertices and the wrap-around case is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
