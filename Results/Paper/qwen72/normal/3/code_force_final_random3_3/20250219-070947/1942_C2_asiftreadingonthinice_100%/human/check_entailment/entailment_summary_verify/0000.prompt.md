You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates a value `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of integers and the value of `y`. The final value of `ans` is adjusted and printed, ensuring it does not exceed `n - 2`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state includes the printed results for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly handle the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be cut from a regular polygon with `n` sides, given `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and the ability to choose up to `y` additional vertices. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of vertices `a` chosen by Bessie.

2. **Sorting and Initial Calculation**:
   - The vertices `a` are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between chosen vertices.
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`, which is a reasonable starting point based on the problem constraints.

3. **Gap Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` to calculate gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive vertices is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans` (indicating a triangle can be formed).
   - If the gap is even, it adds the gap divided by 2 to a temporary list `tmp` (indicating potential additional vertices that can be chosen to form more triangles).

4. **Handling the Circular Nature of the Polygon**:
   - The program also checks the gap between the last and first vertices in the sorted list, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
   - Similar to the previous step, if the gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans`.
   - If the gap is even, it adds the gap divided by 2 to the temporary list `tmp`.

5. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices**:
   - The temporary list `tmp` is sorted to prioritize smaller gaps.
   - The program iterates through `tmp` and checks if the remaining `y` vertices can be used to form additional triangles.
   - If `y` is sufficient to cover the gap, it adds the number of triangles that can be formed and decrements `y` accordingly.
   - If `y` is not sufficient, it breaks out of the loop.

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program adds any remaining `y` vertices to `ans` (since each additional vertex can form at least one more triangle).
   - It ensures the final answer does not exceed `n - 2`, which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed in a polygon with `n` sides.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, including the circular nature of the polygon and the limits on the number of additional vertices that can be chosen. No obvious edge cases or logical errors are present in the code that would cause it to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
