The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tmp`. For the loop to execute, `tmp` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take on the values of the elements in `tmp` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2.
- `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2.
- If the difference between the first element of `a` and `a[len(a) - 1]` plus `n` is exactly 2, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negation of the last element of `a` is even, `tmp` now includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
- The difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `tmp` to ensure it contains at least one element. The variable `i` will be adjusted by the loop itself, so we don't need to modify it.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` must have at least one element**
