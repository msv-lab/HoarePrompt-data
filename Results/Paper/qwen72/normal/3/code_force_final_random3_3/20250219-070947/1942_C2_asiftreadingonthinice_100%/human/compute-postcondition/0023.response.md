Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `ans` remains as defined in the previous iteration. If `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` now contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.***
