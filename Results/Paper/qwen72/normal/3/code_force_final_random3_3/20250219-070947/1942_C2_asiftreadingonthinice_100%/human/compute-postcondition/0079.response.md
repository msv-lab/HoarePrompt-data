Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition, `tmp` is a list containing the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` is greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. Additionally, the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negative of the last element of `a` is exactly 2.**
