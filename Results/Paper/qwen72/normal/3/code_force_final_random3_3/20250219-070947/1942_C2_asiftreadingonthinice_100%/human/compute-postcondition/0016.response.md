Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1, `tmp` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += 1` increases the value of `ans` by 1. The initial state specifies that `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. The condition about the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` being 2 is not checked in the provided code, so `ans` is increased by 1 regardless of the difference. Since the code does not define or modify `tmp`, `tmp` remains undefined. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
