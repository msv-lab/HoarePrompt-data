Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus the value of `i`, `y` is `y - (i - 1)`, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `tmp` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`.
- The value of `i` is the next element in `tmp`.
- All other conditions and variables (`a`, `ans`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.
