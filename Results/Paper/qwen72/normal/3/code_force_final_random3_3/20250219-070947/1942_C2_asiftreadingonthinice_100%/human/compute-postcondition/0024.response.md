Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 4 elements, and `i` is 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1 and `tmp` remains as defined in the previous iteration. Otherwise, `ans` remains as defined in the previous iteration, and if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` now contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.***
