Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` >= `i - 1`, `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y` < `i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `y` remains less than `i - 1`. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` must have at least 2 elements.***
