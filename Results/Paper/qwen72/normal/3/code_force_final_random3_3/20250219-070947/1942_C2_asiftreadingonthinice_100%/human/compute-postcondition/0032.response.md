Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. `tmp` is a list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2. If the difference between the first element of `a` and `a[len(a) - 1]` plus `n` is exactly 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negation of the last element of `a` is even, `tmp` now includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. The difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2.***
