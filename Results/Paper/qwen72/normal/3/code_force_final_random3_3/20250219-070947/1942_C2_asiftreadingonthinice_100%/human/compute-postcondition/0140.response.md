To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `tmp`.

1. **`i`**: This variable is not directly used in the loop head as an iterator, but rather as the loop variable that will take on the values from `tmp`. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` directly.

2. **`tmp`**: The loop will execute if `tmp` is not empty. The state of `tmp` is determined by the conditions provided in the task description. Specifically, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2. Additionally, if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] != 2`, the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute, `tmp` must contain at least one element.

State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] != 2`, the current value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`. `tmp` must contain at least one element.**
