Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition, `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` must be greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list.**
