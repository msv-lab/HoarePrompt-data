The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters that contains exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If it is not possible to generate such a string, the function should return "NO". Otherwise, it should return "YES" followed by a string of length at most 200 that satisfies the condition.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and returns "NO" if it is not possible to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If such a string can be generated, it returns "YES" followed by a string of length at most 200 that satisfies the condition.**
