The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and checks if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `t` and `n` are no longer in scope.
