Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer and `n` is even.
- `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables. It only prints the constant string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
