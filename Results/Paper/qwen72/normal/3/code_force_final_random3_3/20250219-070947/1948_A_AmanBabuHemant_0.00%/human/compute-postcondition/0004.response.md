The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an odd integer, but these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `t` and `n`.

Output: **NO**
