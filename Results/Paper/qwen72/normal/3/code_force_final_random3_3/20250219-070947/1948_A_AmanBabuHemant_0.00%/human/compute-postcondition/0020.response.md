Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`.
   - If `n` is even:
     - `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
     - The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200.
     - `t` is decremented by 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` (if `n` is even) do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the initial state or any conditions.

Output: **NO**
