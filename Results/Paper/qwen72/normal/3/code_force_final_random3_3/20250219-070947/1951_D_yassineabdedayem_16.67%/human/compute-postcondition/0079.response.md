To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head:
```
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
```
The variables in the loop head are `n`, `k`, and `rep`. We need to ensure that these conditions are met for the loop to execute again.

1. **`n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`**: This condition is already met at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **`k` is positive**: This condition is also met at the end of the previous iteration.
3. **`rep` is less than 60**: At the end of the previous iteration, `rep` is 2. Since 2 is less than 60, this condition is met.

Since all the conditions in the loop head are already met, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(number)`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `tab` contains `str(Min)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Max`, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `tab` contains `str(Max)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and `number` is `Max`. `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**
