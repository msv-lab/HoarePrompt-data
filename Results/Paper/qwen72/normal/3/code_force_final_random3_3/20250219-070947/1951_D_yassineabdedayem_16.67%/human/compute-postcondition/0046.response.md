The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` must have at least two elements, and `i` is the second element of `tab`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations, `k` is currently 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `tab`**
