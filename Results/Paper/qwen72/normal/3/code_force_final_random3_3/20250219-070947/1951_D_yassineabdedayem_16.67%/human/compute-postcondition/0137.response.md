Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 2, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, the string representation of the updated `number`, and the string representation of the final `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is updated to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is updated to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tab.append(str(number))` adds the string representation of the final `number` to the list `tab`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- The list `tab` now contains three elements: the initial string representation of `number`, the string representation of the updated `number`, and the string representation of the final `number`.
- The conditions and updates for `k` and `number` remain as specified in the initial state.
