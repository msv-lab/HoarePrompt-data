Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.***
