Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is updated to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is updated to `Max`.**
