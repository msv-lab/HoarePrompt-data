Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation:
- `number` is assigned the value of `Min`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero still holds.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` still holds.
- The condition that `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0 still holds.
- The condition that `rep` is 1 still holds.
- The condition that `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` still holds, but `number` is now `Min`.
- The condition that `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` still holds.
- The condition that `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` still holds.
