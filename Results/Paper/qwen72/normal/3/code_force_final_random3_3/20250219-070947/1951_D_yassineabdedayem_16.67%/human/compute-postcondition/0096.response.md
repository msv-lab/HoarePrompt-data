Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop and is currently 0.
   - `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string elements.
   - `i` is the second string element in `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `i` is defined as the second string element in the list `tab`.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is the second string element in `tab`, the output will be the second string element of `tab` followed by a space.

Output: **[second string element in tab] **

For example, if `tab` is `['first', 'second', 'third']`, the output will be:
Output: **second **
