Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is set to `Min` and `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is set to `Max` and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.**
