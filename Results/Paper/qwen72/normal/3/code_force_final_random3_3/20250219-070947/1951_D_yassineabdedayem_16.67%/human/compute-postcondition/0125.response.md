Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - Min` and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is updated to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are still updated based on the initial conditions.
- The value of `number` is still updated to `Max`.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representation of `number`.
- The variable `rep` remains 1.
- The variable `_` remains 2.
- The variable `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
