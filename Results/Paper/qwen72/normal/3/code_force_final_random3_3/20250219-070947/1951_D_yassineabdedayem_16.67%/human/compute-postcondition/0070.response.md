Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string element `str(number)`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min` if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- `Min` is now the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is now the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The value of `number` is still determined by the conditions: if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `number` is `Min`; otherwise, `number` is `Max`.
