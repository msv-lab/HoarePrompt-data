The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`. The function then performs a series of operations to determine if it is possible to reduce `n` to 0 by repeatedly subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`, where `Min` and `Max` are the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively. If `k` reaches 0 before `n` becomes 0, the function prints 'YES', followed by the number of operations performed and the sequence of numbers used in the operations. If `k` does not reach 0, the function prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the remaining values of `n` and `k` for the last test case, the total number of iterations `rep` (up to 60), and the list `tab` containing the string representations of the numbers used in the operations for the last test case.
