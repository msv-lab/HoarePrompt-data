To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of a `number` value.
   - `i` is the third element of `tab`.
   - `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop.

2. **Context:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement is printing the third element of the list `tab`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

3. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly defined as the third element of the list `tab`.
   - `tab` contains at least three string representations of the `number` value.

4. **Value of `number`:**
   - `number` is the last value generated in the loop, but the exact value of `number` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it as the last value of `number` generated in the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is the third element of `tab`, and `tab` contains string representations of `number`, the third element of `tab` will be a string representation of a `number` value.
   - The exact value of this `number` is not specified, but it is one of the values generated in the loop.

Given the above analysis, the output will be the third element of the list `tab`, which is a string representation of a `number` value.

Output: **[third element of tab] (where the third element of tab is a string representation of a number value generated in the loop)**
