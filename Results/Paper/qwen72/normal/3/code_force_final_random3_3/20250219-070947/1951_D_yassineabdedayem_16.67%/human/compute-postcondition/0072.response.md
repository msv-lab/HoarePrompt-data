Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is `k - Max`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string element `str(Min)`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- `Min` and `Max` are still defined as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively.
- `number` is still equal to `Min`.
