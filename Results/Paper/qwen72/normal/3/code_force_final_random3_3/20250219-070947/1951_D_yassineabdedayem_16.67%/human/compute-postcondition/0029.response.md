Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, `k` is updated to be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `k` are still subject to the conditions provided in the initial state.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated to the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `int(n / k)` respectively, which are the same as the initial values of `Min` and `Max` since the code snippet does not change the values of `n` or `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects the same values for `Min` and `Max` as in the initial state.
