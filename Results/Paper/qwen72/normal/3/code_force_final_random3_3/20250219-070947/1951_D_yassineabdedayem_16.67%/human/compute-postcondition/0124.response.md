Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, otherwise `k` is 0 and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is updated to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `number` is `Max`.
- The code snippet `number = Max` does not change the value of `number` because it is already set to `Max`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the explicit confirmation that `number` is still `Max`.
