Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(number)`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `tab` contains `str(Min)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Max`, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `tab` contains `str(Max)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and `number` is `Max`. `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- `Min` is assigned the value of `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` is assigned the value of `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- `number` is assigned the value of `Max`.
- `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then:
  - `tab` contains `str(Min)` as the second element.
  - `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
  - `number` is updated to `Min`.
- Otherwise:
  - `tab` contains `str(Max)` as the second element.
  - `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
  - `number` remains `Max`.
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
