Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(number)`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` remains 1.
- `n` remains non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` remains positive.
- `rep` remains 2.
- `tab` remains a list with two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(number)`.
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- `number` is now `Min`.
- `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
