Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing three string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(number)`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then the third element of `tab` is `str(Min)`. Otherwise, the third element of `tab` is `str(Max)`.**
