Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, otherwise `k` is 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.**

The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
