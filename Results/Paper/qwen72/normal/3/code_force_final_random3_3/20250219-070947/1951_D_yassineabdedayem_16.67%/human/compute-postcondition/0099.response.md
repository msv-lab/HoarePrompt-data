Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop and is currently 0, `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing `rep` string elements, `i` is the last string element in `tab`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The input integer `t` remains unchanged.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged and are still 0.
- The variable `rep` indicates the total number of iterations, which is the same as the number of string elements in the list `tab`.
- The list `tab` contains exactly `rep` string elements.
- The variable `i` holds the value of the last string element in the list `tab`.
