Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop and is currently 0.
   - `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string element.
   - `i` is the first string element in `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `i` with a space character as the end delimiter.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is the first string element in the list `tab`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is the first string element in `tab`, the `print` statement will output this string followed by a space.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **[i] (where [i] is the first string element in the list `tab`)**
