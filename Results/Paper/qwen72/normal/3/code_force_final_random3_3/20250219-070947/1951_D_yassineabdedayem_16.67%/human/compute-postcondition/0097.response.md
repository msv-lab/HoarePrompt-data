The only objects in the loop head are the list `tab` and the variable `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string elements, and `i` is the second string element in `tab`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least 3 string elements, and `i` will be the third string element in `tab`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop and is currently 0, `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing at least 3 string elements, `i` is the third string element in `tab`**
