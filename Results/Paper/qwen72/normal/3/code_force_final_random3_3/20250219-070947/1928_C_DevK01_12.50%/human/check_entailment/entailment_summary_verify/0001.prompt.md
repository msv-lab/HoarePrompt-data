You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, as well as their corresponding quotients `q // d` that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` from the input.

2. **Initial Check for Odd `y`:**
   - The program calculates `y` as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, it means `n + x` is odd, and there is no valid `k` that can satisfy the conditions of the problem.

3. **Function `func_1` for Finding Divisors:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `q` to find divisors of `q`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` and `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and adds them to the list `M`.

4. **Main Logic for Finding Valid `k` Values:**
   - The program calculates `L1` by calling `func_1` with `((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`. If this condition is true, it calls `func_1` again with `((n - x) // 2, x)` and adds the results to `L1`.
   - The program converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `3 * x - 2`, which means no additional valid `k` values can be found.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Odd `y` Check:**
  - If `y` is odd, the program correctly prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is because the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and `n + x` being odd means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy the pattern.

- **Finding Divisors:**
  - The function `func_1` is designed to find all valid `k` values by checking divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is a correct approach because the settling pattern involves numbers that are within the range of `1` to `k`.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines the results from two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set. This ensures that all unique valid `k` values are counted.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of valid `k` values based on the given problem description and constraints. There are no obvious logical errors or issues with the approach.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
