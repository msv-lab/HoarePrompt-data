Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 3, and `w` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[i]` appended to its previous content. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.***
