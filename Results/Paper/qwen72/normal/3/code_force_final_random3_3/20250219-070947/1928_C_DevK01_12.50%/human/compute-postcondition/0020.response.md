The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `w`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `int(w // 1) - 1` (since `range` is exclusive of the stop value).

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `w` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `w // 1` is simply `w` because integer division by 1 does not change the value.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 3.
- `w` must be greater than or equal to 3, because `i` must be less than `int(w // 1)` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 3, and `w` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[w, i, q // i, 2]`. If `q` is divisible by `i` but `q // i` is less than `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[2]`. If `q` is not divisible by `i`, `M` remains unchanged.**
