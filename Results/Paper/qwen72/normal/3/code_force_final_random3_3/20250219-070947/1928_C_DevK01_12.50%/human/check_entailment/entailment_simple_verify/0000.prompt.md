You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function and the main loop has some issues that can lead to incorrect results.

1. **Incorrect Handling of `w`**:
   - The line `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:` checks if `w` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, `w` is calculated as the square root of `q`, which is `(n + x - 2) // 2`. This approach is not correct for determining the valid values of `k`.
   - The square root check is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the value of `q` is 10, and `w` is approximately 3.16, which is not an integer. The program will not add 3 to the list `M`, even though `k = 3` is a valid solution.

2. **Incorrect Range in `func_1`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):` should iterate over all possible divisors of `q`, not just up to the integer part of the square root. This can miss valid divisors. For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 2`, `q` is 10, and the loop will only check divisors up to 3, missing the divisor 5.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Adding Divisors**:
   - The divisors are added to the list `M` if they meet certain conditions, but the conditions are not correctly formulated. For example, the condition `if i >= x - 1:` and `if q // i >= x - 1:` are not sufficient to ensure that `k` is a valid solution.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge case where `n` is very close to `x`. For example, if `n = 100` and `x = 99`, the program should output 0, but it does not handle this case correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate over possible values of `k` and check if the given `n` and `x` fit the described pattern.
- Ensure that the pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and that the number `x` is correctly assigned based on the position `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = []
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k - 1 and (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == x - 1:
            valid_ks.append(k)
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This version correctly checks all possible values of `k` and ensures that the given `n` and `x` fit the described pattern.
