Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < q â‰¤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 3, `w` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `M` now contains `[i]` appended to its previous content.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` (which is 3) is appended to the list `M`.
- The initial conditions for `q`, `x`, and `w` remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `M` are updated to reflect the new element added to the list.
