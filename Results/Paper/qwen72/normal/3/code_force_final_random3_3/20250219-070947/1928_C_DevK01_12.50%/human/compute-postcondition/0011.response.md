Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < q â‰¤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), the current value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` now contains `[w, i, q // i]` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` contains `[i, q // i]`.**
