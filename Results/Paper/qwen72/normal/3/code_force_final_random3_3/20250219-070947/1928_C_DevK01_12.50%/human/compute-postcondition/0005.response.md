The objects in the loop head are `i` and `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than or equal to 1, because the range function will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `int(w // 1) - 1`, and this sequence must contain at least one value for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9.
- `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- If `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[w]`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, `w` must be at least 1. Since `w` is the square root of `q`, and `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^9, `w` will always be at least 1. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to 1, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` contains `[w]` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than or equal to 1**
