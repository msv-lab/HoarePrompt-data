The value of `q // i` is calculated and appended to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 3 and `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, and `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `w` must be greater than or equal to 3. Since `i` is 3, it is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`, so `M` already contains `[i]`. The new value `q // i` is an integer division of `q` by 3, and this value is appended to `M`.

Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 3, `w` is greater than or equal to 3, `M` contains `[3, q // 3]`**.
