The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where both `q` and `x` are integers and must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `M` that contains all divisors of `q` which are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients `q // d` that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, as well as their corresponding quotients `q // d` that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
