Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the way the `func_1` function constructs the mapping for decoding. According to the problem, the decoding process should involve creating a string `r` of distinct characters from the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`. However, the current implementation in `func_1` does not follow this logic. Instead, it attempts to create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to a character that has not yet been mapped, which does not align with the symmetric replacement rule.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create the auxiliary string r with distinct characters in alphabetical order
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)
```

This corrected version correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` and then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart. It then uses this mapping to decode the input string `encoded`.
