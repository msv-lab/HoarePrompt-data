The only objects in the loop head are variables `c`, and the range defined by `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. The loop will execute if the range is valid, which it always is since it spans from the ASCII value of 'a' (97) to the ASCII value of 'z' (122) inclusive. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the loop head. However, we can specify the initial state of `c` and the range for clarity.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97 (the ASCII value of 'a')**
