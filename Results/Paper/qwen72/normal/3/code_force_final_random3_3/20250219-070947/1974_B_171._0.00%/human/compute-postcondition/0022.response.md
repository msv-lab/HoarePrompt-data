The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `encoded`. The loop iterates over each character in `encoded`, so the state of `char` needs to be adjusted to the next character in `encoded` for the loop to execute one more time. The state of `encoded` remains the same, as it is the iterable being looped over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, and `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. If `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the second character in `encoded` (assuming `encoded` has at least two characters). The state of `mapping` and `decoded` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. If `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
