Output State: **If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`. If `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `decoded` is a list containing the characters 'a' and `char`, and `mapping` contains the entry `{'a': char}`. The loop terminates after the first iteration if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`.** 

Explanation:
- If `char` is in `mapping`, the value of `mapping[char]` is appended to `decoded`, making `decoded` a list containing this value.
- If `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `decoded` is updated to be a list containing 'a' and `char`, and `mapping` is updated to include the entry `{'a': char}`.
- In all cases, if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, the loop terminates after the first iteration.
