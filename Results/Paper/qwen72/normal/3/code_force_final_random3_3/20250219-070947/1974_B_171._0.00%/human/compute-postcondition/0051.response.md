The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which is from 97 to 122 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 99, and it must still be within the range specified by the loop.

State: **`c` is 99, `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged except possibly for a new key-value pair where the key is 'b' and the value is `chr(98)`. If `chr(98)` is not in `mapping.values()`, the new key-value pair is added, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
