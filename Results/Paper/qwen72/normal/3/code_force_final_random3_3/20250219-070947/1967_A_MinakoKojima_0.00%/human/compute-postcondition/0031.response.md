Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is 0. `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, and they are updated to the values provided by the user.
- The placeholder `_` remains unchanged.
- The list `a` is now updated to the list of integers input by the user.
- `m` is still the smallest integer in the list `a`, but the specific value of `m` will depend on the new values in `a`.
- `ans` remains 0.
