The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function before the loop starts.

Given that `n` and `k` are already stated to be integers greater than 0, and the other variables (`_`, `a`, `m`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
