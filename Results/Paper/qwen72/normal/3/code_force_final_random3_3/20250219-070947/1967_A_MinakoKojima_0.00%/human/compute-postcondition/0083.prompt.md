Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are integers, both greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, `i` is set to `n-1`, and `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`. Additionally, each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `i` is `n-1`, `a[i]` for all `i` in the range `n` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, and `ans` is set to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1] - a[0]` to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
