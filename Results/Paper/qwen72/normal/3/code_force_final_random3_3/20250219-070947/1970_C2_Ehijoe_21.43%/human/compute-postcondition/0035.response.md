Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with all keys processed, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one neighbor, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If at least one element in `moves` is an odd number, the function behaves accordingly to the if part. If all elements in `moves` are even, the function behaves accordingly to the else part.***
