The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `t` is an integer and t = 1.
- `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.
- `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.

The function returns a list of integers representing the nodes that can be reached from the `start` node within `t` time units, where `t` is always 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. It returns a list of integers representing the nodes that can be reached from the `start` node within 1 time unit.**
