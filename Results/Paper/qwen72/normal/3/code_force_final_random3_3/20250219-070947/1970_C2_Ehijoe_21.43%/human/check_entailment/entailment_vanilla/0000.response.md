### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is activated.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The game is played optimally by both players.
   - The goal is to determine the winner for each round based on the starting node.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - The next `n-1` lines describe the edges of the tree.
   - The last line contains the starting node for the round.
   - The output should be either "Ron" or "Hermione" based on who wins the round.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function computes the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
     - It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and collect the distances.
     - If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor and that neighbor is the parent), it returns `[0]`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively computes the distances for all its children and adds 1 to each distance.
     - The function returns a list of distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the input and constructs the tree using a `defaultdict` of lists.
     - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a `deque`.
     - It then calls `func_1` to compute the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
     - Finally, it checks if any of the distances is odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - **Tree Construction:**
     - The tree is correctly constructed using the edges provided in the input.
     - Each node is added to the adjacency list of its connected nodes.

   - **Distance Calculation:**
     - The `func_1` function correctly computes the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
     - The recursive approach ensures that all paths are explored, and the distances are correctly incremented.

   - **Winner Determination:**
     - The logic to determine the winner is based on the parity of the distances.
     - If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins because he can always make the first move and force Hermione into a losing position.
     - If all distances are even, Hermione wins because she can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring that Ron is the one who cannot make a move.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the tree is a single edge (i.e., `n = 2`).
   - It also handles larger trees with multiple branches and leaf nodes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It constructs the tree, computes the distances, and determines the winner based on the parity of the distances.

**Correctness: True**
