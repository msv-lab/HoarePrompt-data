Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `t = 1`. It then reads `n - 1` pairs of integers representing edges between nodes and constructs a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node and each value is a list of its neighbors. The function identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. It reads another integer `start` from the input, where `1 <= start <= n`, and calls a function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments, which returns a list of integers `moves`. If any integer in `moves` is odd, the function prints 'Ron'. Otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. **
