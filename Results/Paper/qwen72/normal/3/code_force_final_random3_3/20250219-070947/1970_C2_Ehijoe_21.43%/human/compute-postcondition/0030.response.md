Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with all keys processed, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one neighbor, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`**. 

The value of `moves` is determined by the function `func_1` which takes `nodes` and `start` as arguments. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
