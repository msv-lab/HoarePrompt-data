Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated with the values provided by `input().split()`, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `empty` is now set to `True`.
