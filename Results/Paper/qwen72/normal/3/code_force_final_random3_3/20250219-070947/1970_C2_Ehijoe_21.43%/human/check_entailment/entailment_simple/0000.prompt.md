Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer and t = 1, nodes is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.

        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.

    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)

    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with all keys processed, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one neighbor, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If at least one element in `moves` is an odd number, the function behaves accordingly to the if part. If all elements in `moves` are even, the function behaves accordingly to the else part.
