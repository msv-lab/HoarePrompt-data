The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies that `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
