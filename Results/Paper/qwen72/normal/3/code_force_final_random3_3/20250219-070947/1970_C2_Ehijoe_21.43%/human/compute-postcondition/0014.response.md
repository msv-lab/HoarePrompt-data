Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` is a list that now includes `v` three times, `nodes[v]` is a list that includes `u` twice.** 

The value `v` is appended to the list `nodes[u]`, which already contained `v` twice, so `nodes[u]` now includes `v` three times. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
