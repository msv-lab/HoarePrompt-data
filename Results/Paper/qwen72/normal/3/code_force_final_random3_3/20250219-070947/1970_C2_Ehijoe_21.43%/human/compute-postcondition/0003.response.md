Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated with the values provided by `input().split()`, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is now a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, but `nodes` is now a `defaultdict` with `list` as its default factory, meaning that any key accessed in `nodes` that does not already exist will automatically be initialized to an empty list. The values of `n`, `t`, `start`, `edges`, and `empty` remain as they were initially described.
