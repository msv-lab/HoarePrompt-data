To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts from 1. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `n`, which means the loop will not execute as `i` is already at the end of the range. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to start from 1.

State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0.**
