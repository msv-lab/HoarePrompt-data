Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is a string input by the user, and `xx` now contains the list `x` as its last element. If the second character of `x` is 'F', `a[i]` is incremented by 1 and `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If the second character of `x` is not 'F', and the first character of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `b[1]` remains unchanged.***
