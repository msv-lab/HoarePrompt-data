Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is 3. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`), `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'S' at the end.**
