Output State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` for each iteration `i` from 1 to `n`. Each `nx` string is constructed based on the conditions in the loop: if the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended directly to `nx`. If the character is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- The variable `i` is now `n + 1`, indicating the loop has finished.
- The list `sa` remains unchanged, containing all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0.
- The variable `j` is `n + 1`, indicating the inner loop has also completed for each iteration of `i`.
- For each iteration `i` from 1 to `n`, a string `nx` of length `n` is constructed. The characters in `nx` are determined by the following rules:
  - If the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is directly appended to `nx`.
  - If the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`.
  - Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.
- The final output consists of `n` strings, each printed after its respective iteration of the loop.
