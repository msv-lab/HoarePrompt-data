Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 1, `nx` is an empty string, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.**
