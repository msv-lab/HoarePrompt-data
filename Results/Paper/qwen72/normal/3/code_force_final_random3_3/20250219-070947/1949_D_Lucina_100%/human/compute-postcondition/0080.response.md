Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is a string input by the user, `xx` now contains the list `x` as its last element, `a[i]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1 and `b[i]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then `a[j]`, `b[j]`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged.**
