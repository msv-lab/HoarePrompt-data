You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a symmetric matrix of characters ('F', 'S', '?', or '.') provided by the user. It reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 24) and `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters. The function then counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column of the matrix. It identifies indices where 'F' or 'S' are exclusively present and appends these indices to lists `sa` and `sb`, respectively. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to `sb`, the function appends indices where both 'F' and 'S' are absent to `sa` and updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'F' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements in `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise. If the length of `sa` is less than `sb`, it appends such indices to `sb` and updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'S' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements in `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise. The function prints the updated matrix.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of scenarios `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing the transition videos between scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary videos associated with each scenario, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input lines, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Funny and Scary Videos**:
   - The program iterates through each input line and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each scenario based on the characters 'F' and 'S'.
   - This ensures that the program knows how many funny and scary videos are already decided for each scenario.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only Funny or Only Scary Videos**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny videos (i.e., `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`) and only scary videos (i.e., `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] > 0`), respectively.
   - This helps in determining which scenarios have a fixed type and which are still undecided.

4. **Assigning Videos to Undecided Scenarios**:
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny videos (`len(sa)`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary videos (`len(sb)`), the program assigns the remaining videos to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown.
   - For scenarios that are still undecided, it assigns 'F' to the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - If the number of scenarios with only scary videos is greater, it does the opposite, assigning 'S' to the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) scenarios in `sb` and 'F' to the rest.

5. **Outputting the Final Transition Plan**:
   - The program constructs the final transition plan by iterating through each scenario and each other scenario.
   - If the transition video is already decided (i.e., not '?'), it keeps the original value.
   - If the transition video is undecided, it assigns 'F' or 'S' based on the logic described above.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed transition plan.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Handling of Input and Output**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and constructs the output in the required format.
  - It ensures that the diagonal elements are always '.' and that the matrix is symmetric.

- **Assignment of Undecided Videos**:
  - The program attempts to assign 'F' or 'S' to the undecided videos in a way that avoids having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
  - However, the logic for assigning videos to the undecided scenarios is not entirely correct. The program only considers the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) scenarios in `sa` or `sb`, which might not be sufficient to ensure the required constraint for all permutations.

- **Constraint Satisfaction**:
  - The program does not guarantee that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is satisfied for all permutations of scenarios.
  - The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided scenarios is too simplistic and might lead to violations of the constraint in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
