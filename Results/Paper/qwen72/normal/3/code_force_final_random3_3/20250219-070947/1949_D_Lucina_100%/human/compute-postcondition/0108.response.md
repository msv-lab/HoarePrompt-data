Output State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is `n`, `xx` contains `n` strings, each string being one of the `n` lines of input, `a` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'F' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines, `b` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'S' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines. `sa` is a list containing the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0. `sb` is a list containing the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `b` is greater than 0 and the corresponding element in `a` is 0.**
