The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `sb`. Given that `i` is 1, the value 1 is appended to `sb`. The values of `n`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is a list that now contains the value 1.**
