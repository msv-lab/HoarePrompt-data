The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 3. If `x[1]` is 'F', then `a[1]` and `a[2]` are both increased by 1. If `x[1]` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[2]` are both increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` remain unchanged.**
