Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is still a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is `mid - 1`, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, and `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variables `left` and `right` have not changed and still satisfy `left` < `right`.
- The variable `clique` remains a positive integer.
- The variable `small_element` is still `left + 1`.
- The variable `big_element` is still `right + 1`.
- The variable `mid` is still `(right - left) // 2`, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `not_mid` is still `right - left + 1 - mid`.
- The loop variable `i` has reached `mid - 1`, the last index of the loop.
- The elements in the array `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` have been set to values starting from `left + 1` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent index.
- The elements in the array `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` have all been set to the value of `clique`.
