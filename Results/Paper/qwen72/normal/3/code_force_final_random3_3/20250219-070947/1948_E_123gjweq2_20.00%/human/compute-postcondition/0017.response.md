The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `not_mid`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the value of `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 0)

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1
- `not_mid` must remain the same, so `not_mid` is still `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 0)

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 0), `i` is 1, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `clique`.**
