Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 0), `i` is 1, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `clique`.**

The code `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` reassigns the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i` for the specific value of `i` which is 1. The initial state already specifies that `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`, so the assignment does not change the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` for `i = 1`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
