Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is 1, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 2 + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` updates the value of `arr[left + i]`.
- Given that `i` is 1 and `small_element` is `left + 1`, the new value of `arr[left + i]` becomes `left + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `left + 2 + i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
