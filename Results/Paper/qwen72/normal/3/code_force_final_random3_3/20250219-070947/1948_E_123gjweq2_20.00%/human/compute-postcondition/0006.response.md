Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is 0, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i`. Since `i` is 0, the index `left + i` is simply `left`. Therefore, `cliquess[left]` is now equal to `clique`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
