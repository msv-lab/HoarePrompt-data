Functionality: ** The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function populates an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` with specific values. After the function concludes, `arr` contains a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern: the first half of the range from `left` to `left + mid - 1` is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half from `left + mid` to `right` is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1` and moving backwards. The `cliquess` array is filled with the value of `clique` for all indices from `left` to `right`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` in place. **
