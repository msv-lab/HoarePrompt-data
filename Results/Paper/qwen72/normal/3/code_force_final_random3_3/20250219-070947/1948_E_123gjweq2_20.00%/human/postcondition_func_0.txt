The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. The function then creates a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each block of `k` elements (or the remaining elements if less than `k`) is set to the corresponding `i + 1` value, where `i` is the index of the block. The function prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.
