Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Clique Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable approach because it ensures that the vertices are divided into the minimum number of blocks (cliques) of size `k` or smaller.

3. **Array Initialization**: The program initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`. `arr` is intended to store the assigned integers for the vertices, and `cliquess` is intended to store the clique assignments for the vertices.

4. **Clique Assignment**: The function `make_array` is called to populate the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` for each clique. The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It populates the `arr` array with a sequence of integers in a specific pattern (first half increasing, second half decreasing) and assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding positions in the `cliquess` array.

5. **Pattern in `arr`**: The pattern in `arr` is designed to ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k` is met for vertices in the same clique. By filling the first half of the block with increasing values and the second half with decreasing values, the function ensures that the difference in vertex numbers and their assigned integers is minimized within each block, which helps in forming cliques.

6. **Output**: The program prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array. The `arr` array contains the assigned integers for the vertices, the number of cliques is printed, and the `cliquess` array contains the clique assignments for each vertex.

7. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values. For example, when `k` is large enough to cover all vertices in a single clique, the program will correctly output a single clique.

8. **Correctness of Clique Formation**: The function `make_array` ensures that the vertices are assigned to cliques in such a way that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. This is achieved by the specific pattern of increasing and decreasing values in `arr`.

9. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem description, with the first line containing the assigned integers, the second line containing the number of cliques, and the third line containing the clique assignments.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
