Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without properly initializing them within the scope of each test case. This can lead to incorrect results when running multiple test cases, as the state of these variables will persist across different test cases.

2. **Incorrect Clique Calculation**: The calculation of the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)` is incorrect. The correct number of cliques should be based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \). The provided formula does not account for the specific structure of the graph and the assignment of integers to vertices.

3. **Incorrect Assignment of Elements**: The way elements are assigned to the array `arr` and the cliques `cliquess` in the `make_array` function is flawed. The logic for splitting the elements into smaller and larger parts and assigning them to the array is not correct and does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when \( k \) is very large or very small relative to \( n \).

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Initialize Variables**: Ensure that `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized for each test case.
2. **Correct Clique Calculation**: Use a more appropriate method to determine the number of cliques based on the given constraints.
3. **Assign Elements**: Assign the integers to vertices in a way that ensures the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / (k + 1))
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = (i + 1) % (k + 1) + 1
        cliquess[i] = (i + 1) // (k + 1) + 1

    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Clique Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / (k + 1))`. This is because each clique can contain up to \( k + 1 \) vertices.
2. **Element Assignment**: The elements are assigned in a cyclic manner to ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for vertices within the same clique.
3. **Clique Assignment**: The cliques are assigned based on the index of the vertices, ensuring that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
