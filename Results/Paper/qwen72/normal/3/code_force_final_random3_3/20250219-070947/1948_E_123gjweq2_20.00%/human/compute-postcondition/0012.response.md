Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is 2, `arr[left + 2]` is `left + 3`, `cliquess[left + 2]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**

The value of `cliquess[left + i]` is updated to `clique`. Since `i` is 2, `cliquess[left + 2]` is also updated to `clique`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
