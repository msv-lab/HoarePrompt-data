Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. According to the problem description, if `k >= n`, the graph can be partitioned into a single clique, as the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will always be satisfied for any pair of vertices. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this and will still try to partition the graph into multiple cliques, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8 16
```
The expected output should be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
However, the current program will output:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
2
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
```
This output is incorrect because the graph can be partitioned into a single clique, but the program partitions it into two cliques.
