Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2` = `(right - left) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
