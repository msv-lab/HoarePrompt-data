The objects in the loop head are `i`, `mid`, `left`, and `right`. To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions that must be true for the loop to continue.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0).
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop condition `i in range(mid)` must still be true.
- This means `i` must be less than `mid`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.
- `mid` remains the same, which is `(right - left) // 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is 1, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 2`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`**.
