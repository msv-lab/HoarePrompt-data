Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`, `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`, `_` is a placeholder, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is not equal to '02', '01', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', or '22'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.***
