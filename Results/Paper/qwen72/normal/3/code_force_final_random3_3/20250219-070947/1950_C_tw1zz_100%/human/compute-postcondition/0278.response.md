Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", and the loop has printed the time in 12-hour format for each input string `s` provided by the user. For each input string, `h` is the hour part, `m` is the minute part, `h1` is the hour part converted to 12-hour format, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part. The loop counter `_` has been incremented for each iteration, and the loop has executed `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the initial value of `s` (which is a string in the format "hh:mm") is used to determine the hour and minute parts for each iteration. The loop converts the hour part to 12-hour format and prints the time with either 'AM' or 'PM' as appropriate. The loop counter `_` is incremented for each iteration, and the loop runs exactly `t` times, printing the converted time for each input string provided by the user.
