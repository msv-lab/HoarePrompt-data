Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`, `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`, `_` is a placeholder, and `m1` is equal to `m`. If `h` is '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.***
