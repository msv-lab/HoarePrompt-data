You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of time conversion operations to perform. For each of the `t` operations, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" from the user, where `hh` is the hour and `mm` is the minute. The function then converts the hour part of the time string to a 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" accordingly. The converted time is printed in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" for each input. After all iterations, the function has printed the converted times for `t` inputs, and the state of the program remains as it was before the function call, except for the output produced.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is `12` and the time is in the AM period. According to the problem description, `12:00 AM` should be converted to `12:00 AM`, but the program incorrectly converts `12:00` to `12:00 PM`. This is a clear violation of the problem requirements, making the program incorrect.
