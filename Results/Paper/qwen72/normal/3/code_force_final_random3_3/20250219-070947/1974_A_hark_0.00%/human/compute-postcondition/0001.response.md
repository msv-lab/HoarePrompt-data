The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 to 10^4, it ensures that `t` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
