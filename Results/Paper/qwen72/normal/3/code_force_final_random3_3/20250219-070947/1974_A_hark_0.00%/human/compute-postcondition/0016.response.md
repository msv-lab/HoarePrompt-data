Postcondition: ***x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. If x > 0 and y > 0, `x` is updated to `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, and `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is 0. If x == 0 and y > 0, the current value of x is 0, and the current value of y is greater than 0. If x > 0 and y == 0, the current value of x is greater than 0, and the current value of y is 0. If x == 0 and y == 0, both x and y remain 0.***
