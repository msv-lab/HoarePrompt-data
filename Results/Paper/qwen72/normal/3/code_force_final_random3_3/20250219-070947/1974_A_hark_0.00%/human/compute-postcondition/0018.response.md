Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, from user input, where both `x` and `y` are in the range 0 to 99. The function then prints a value based on the following conditions:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, updates `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, and calculates `bxsfory1` as 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise as the ceiling of the updated `x / 15` plus 1. It then prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. **
