The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then calls the function `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `func_2` has been called `t` times, and the program state reflects that the loop has completed `t` iterations.
