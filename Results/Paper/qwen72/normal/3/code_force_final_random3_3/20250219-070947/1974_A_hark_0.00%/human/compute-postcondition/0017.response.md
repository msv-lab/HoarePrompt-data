The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function might internally use or generate non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. Since the output is not specified, it is unclear what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` cannot be fully described without additional information about its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unknown based on the provided information.**
