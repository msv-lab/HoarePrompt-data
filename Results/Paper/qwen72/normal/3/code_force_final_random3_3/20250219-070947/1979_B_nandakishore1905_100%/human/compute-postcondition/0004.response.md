To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - `k` is a power of 2.

2. **Understanding `k`:**
   - `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \( k = |n - m| \).
   - Additionally, `k` is specified to be a power of 2. Powers of 2 are numbers of the form \( 2^p \) where \( p \) is a non-negative integer.

3. **Possible Values of `k`:**
   - Since `k` is a power of 2 and `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` can be one of the following values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and so on.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is a power of 2.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical value of `k`. However, we know that `k` will be one of the powers of 2.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and k is a power of 2)**
