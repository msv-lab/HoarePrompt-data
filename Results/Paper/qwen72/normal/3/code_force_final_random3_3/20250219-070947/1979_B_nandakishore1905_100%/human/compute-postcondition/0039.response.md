Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).** 

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged, but a new variable `q` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of (the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` minus 1).
