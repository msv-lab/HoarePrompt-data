Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, and it represents the number of test cases. The list of lists containing the number of stones in each pile for each test case is still expected but not yet defined. Each inner list will contain integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of stones in each pile, with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of all `n` across all test cases should not exceed `2·10^5`.**
