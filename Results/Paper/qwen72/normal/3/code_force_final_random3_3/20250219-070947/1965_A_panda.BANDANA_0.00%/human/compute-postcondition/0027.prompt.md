Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, and it represents the number of test cases. The list of lists containing the number of stones in each pile for each test case is still expected but not yet defined. Each inner list will contain integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of stones in each pile, with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of all `n` across all test cases should not exceed `2·10^5`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    e = set(l)
    m = len(l)
    if 1 in l:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from `l`, `m` is the length of `l`. If `1` is in `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the new input, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the new `l`, `m` is the length of the new `l`. If `1` is in the new `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the new `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the new input, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the new `l`, `m` is the length of the new `l`. If `1` is in the new `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the new `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
