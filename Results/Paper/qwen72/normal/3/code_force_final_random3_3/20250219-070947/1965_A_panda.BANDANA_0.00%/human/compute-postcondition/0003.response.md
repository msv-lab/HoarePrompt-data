The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `l`. The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
