You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. t should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each n (the length of the inner lists) should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each a_i should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        e = set(l)
        
        m = len(l)
        
        if 1 in l:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the last input, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the last `l`, `m` is the length of the last `l`. If `1` is in the last `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the last `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. It returns a list of strings, where each string is "First" if the first player can win the game for the corresponding test case, and "Second" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
