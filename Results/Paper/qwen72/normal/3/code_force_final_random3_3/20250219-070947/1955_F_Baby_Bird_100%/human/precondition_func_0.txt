The function takes no input parameters, but the problem description implies that the function will be called multiple times with different inputs. Each input consists of four non-negative integers p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 (0 \le p_i \le 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The function should be designed to handle these inputs internally, possibly through a loop or a series of test cases.
