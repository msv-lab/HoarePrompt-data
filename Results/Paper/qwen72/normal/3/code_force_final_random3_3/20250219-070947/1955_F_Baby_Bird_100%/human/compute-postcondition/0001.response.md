The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple internal test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \le p_i \le 200 \)) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. The function returns a result based on these internal test cases.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple internal test cases, each with four non-negative integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. It returns a result based on these counts.**
