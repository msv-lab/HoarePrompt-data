Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence. It then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the formula `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3`, which is derived from the properties of the XOR operation and the specific constraints of the problem. The formula correctly handles the distribution of the numbers to maximize Bob's wins, and the program prints the results in the required format. After reviewing the logic and testing with various inputs, the program seems to work correctly for all potential cases.
