### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the set can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers or specific combinations that result in zero XOR.
   - For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, the XOR properties are:
     - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
     - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
     - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 1\)
     - \(2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 1\)

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as often as possible.
   - This can be achieved by removing numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers or specific combinations that result in zero XOR.

4. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum(3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - \( x // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of each number.
     - \( x \% 2 \) gives the remainder when \( x \) is divided by 2, which is 1 if \( x \) is odd and 0 if \( x \) is even.
     - \( 3 \times (x // 2) \) accounts for the pairs, as each pair can be removed without affecting the XOR.
     - \( x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) adds 1 for each odd count of 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4), as these can be used to balance the XOR to zero.
     - The division by 3 ensures that the result is the maximum number of times Bob can win, as each win requires a combination that results in zero XOR.

5. **Verification**:
   - The formula correctly accounts for the pairs and the odd counts of 1, 2, and 3.
   - The division by 3 ensures that the result is the maximum number of times Bob can win, as each win requires a combination that results in zero XOR.
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case correctly.
   - The output is printed in the correct format for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
