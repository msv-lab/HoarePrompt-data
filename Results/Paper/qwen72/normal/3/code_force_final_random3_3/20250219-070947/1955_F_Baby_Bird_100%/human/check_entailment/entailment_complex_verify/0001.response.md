### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - The game is played multiple times, and after each game, one number is removed from the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the set can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers.
   - For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, the XOR properties are:
     - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
     - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
     - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 1\)
     - \(2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 1\)

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as often as possible.
   - This can be achieved by removing numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers or specific combinations that result in zero XOR.

4. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum(3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - \( x // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of each number.
     - \( x \% 2 \) gives the remainder when \( x \) is divided by 2, which is 1 if \( x \) is odd and 0 if \( x \) is even.
     - \( 3 \times (x // 2) \) accounts for the pairs, as each pair can be removed without affecting the XOR.
     - \( x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) adds 1 for each odd count of 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4), as these can be used to balance the XOR to zero.

5. **Verification**:
   - The formula correctly accounts for the pairs and the odd counts of 1, 2, and 3.
   - The division by 3 ensures that the result is the maximum number of times Bob can win, as each win requires a combination that results in zero XOR.
   - However, the formula \( \sum(3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3)) \) needs to be verified to ensure it correctly calculates the maximum number of wins.

6. **Testing the Formula**:
   - For the test case \( 1, 1, 1, 0 \):
     - \( p_1 = 1 \), \( p_2 = 1 \), \( p_3 = 1 \), \( p_4 = 0 \)
     - Calculation: \( 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) + 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) + 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) + 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) \)
     - Simplified: \( 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3 \)
     - Final result: \( 3 // 3 = 1 \)
     - Correct output: 1

   - For the test case \( 1, 0, 1, 2 \):
     - \( p_1 = 1 \), \( p_2 = 0 \), \( p_3 = 1 \), \( p_4 = 2 \)
     - Calculation: \( 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) + 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) + 3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) + 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) \)
     - Simplified: \( 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 5 \)
     - Final result: \( 5 // 3 = 1 \)
     - Correct output: 1

   - For the test case \( 2, 2, 2, 0 \):
     - \( p_1 = 2 \), \( p_2 = 2 \), \( p_3 = 2 \), \( p_4 = 0 \)
     - Calculation: \( 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) + 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) + 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) + 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) \)
     - Simplified: \( 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9 \)
     - Final result: \( 9 // 3 = 3 \)
     - Correct output: 3

   - For the test case \( 3, 3, 2, 0 \):
     - \( p_1 = 3 \), \( p_2 = 3 \), \( p_3 = 2 \), \( p_4 = 0 \)
     - Calculation: \( 3 \times (3 // 2) + 3 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) + 3 \times (3 // 2) + 3 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) + 3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) + 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) \)
     - Simplified: \( 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 11 \)
     - Final result: \( 11 // 3 = 3 \)
     - Correct output: 3

   - For the test case \( 0, 9, 9, 9 \):
     - \( p_1 = 0 \), \( p_2 = 9 \), \( p_3 = 9 \), \( p_4 = 9 \)
     - Calculation: \( 3 \times (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) + 3 \times (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) + 3 \times (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) + 3 \times (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) \)
     - Simplified: \( 0 + 0 + 12 + 1 + 12 + 1 + 12 + 1 = 39 \)
     - Final result: \( 39 // 3 = 13 \)
     - Correct output: 12

   - The last test case \( 0, 9, 9, 9 \) produces an incorrect result. The correct output should be 12, but the program outputs 13. This indicates a potential issue with the formula.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a flaw in the formula for calculating the maximum number of wins. The formula should be adjusted to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases, particularly when the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are high.

Final: **False**
