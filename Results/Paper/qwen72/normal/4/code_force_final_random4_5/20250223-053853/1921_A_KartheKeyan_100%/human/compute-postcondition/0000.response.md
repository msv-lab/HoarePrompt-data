Output State: **The function takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The variable `n` is decreased by 1 for each iteration of the while loop. The variable `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2` and printed for each iteration. The value of `l` is taken as input for each iteration. After the loop, `n` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is initially set to an integer value taken from input.
- For each iteration of the while loop, `n` is decreased by 1.
- In each iteration, `l` is set to an integer value taken from input.
- The variable `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2` and printed.
- The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
- The initial state information about the test cases and their format remains unchanged.
- After the loop, `n` is 0.
