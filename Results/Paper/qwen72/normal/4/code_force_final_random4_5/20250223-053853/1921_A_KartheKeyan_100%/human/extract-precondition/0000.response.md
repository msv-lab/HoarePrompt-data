Precondition: **The function should take a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 to 1000, and it is guaranteed that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

To better match the provided function definition, let's adjust it to accept the input as described:

```python
def func(test_cases):
```

With this adjustment, the precondition now fits the function definition:

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 to 1000, and it is guaranteed that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**
