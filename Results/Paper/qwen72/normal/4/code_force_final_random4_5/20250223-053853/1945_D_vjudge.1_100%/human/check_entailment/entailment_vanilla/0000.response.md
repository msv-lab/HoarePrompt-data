### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people.
   - To move from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`), Kirill pays `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins to each person between `j` and `i` (i.e., for each `k` such that `j < k < i`).
   - The goal is to minimize the total number of coins Kirill spends.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of people `n`, the target position `k`, the list `a`, and the list `b` as input.
   - It creates a new list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. This list `c` represents the minimum cost Kirill would pay to bribe a person at any position.
   - It then computes a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of the elements in `c` from position `i` to the end of the list. This helps in quickly calculating the total cost of bribing all people from position `i` to the end.
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates over the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost. For each position `i` in the first `k` positions, it calculates the cost of moving to position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` if this cost is lower than the current `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The suffix sum array `suff` is correctly computed to store the cumulative cost of bribing people from position `i` to the end.
   - The program correctly iterates over the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost.
   - The cost calculation `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` is correct because it accounts for the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the cumulative cost of bribing all people from position `i + 1` to the end.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly. In this case, the only possible position for Kirill is the first position, and the cost is simply `a[0] + suff[1]`.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly. In this case, Kirill can move to any position, and the minimum cost will be the smallest possible value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

5. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
