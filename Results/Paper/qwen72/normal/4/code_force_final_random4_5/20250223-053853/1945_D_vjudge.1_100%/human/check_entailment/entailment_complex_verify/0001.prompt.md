You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k, a, b)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of integers of length n where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` contains the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is 0. The lists `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `ans` is the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`. The lists `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `suff` remains the same as in the initial state.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `a_i` and `b_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9. The function computes the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This minimum value is then printed. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people.
   - To move from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`), Kirill pays `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins to each person between `j` and `i` (i.e., for each `k` such that `j < k < i`).
   - The goal is to minimize the total number of coins Kirill spends.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of people `n`, the target position `k`, the list `a`, and the list `b` as input.
   - It creates a new list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. This list `c` represents the minimum cost Kirill would pay to bribe a person at any position.
   - It then computes a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of the elements in `c` from position `i` to the end of the list. This helps in quickly calculating the total cost of bribing all people from position `i` to the end.
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates over the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost. For each position `i` in the first `k` positions, it calculates the cost of moving to position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` if this cost is lower than the current `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The suffix sum array `suff` is correctly computed to store the cumulative cost of bribing people from position `i` to the end.
   - The program correctly iterates over the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost.
   - The cost calculation `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` is correct because it accounts for the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the cumulative cost of bribing all people from position `i + 1` to the end.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly. In this case, the only possible position for Kirill is the first position, and the cost is simply `a[0] + suff[1]`.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly. In this case, Kirill can move to any position, and the minimum cost will be the smallest possible value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

5. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
