Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` computes a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is correct because Kirill can choose to pay either `a[i]` or `b[i]` when bribing the i-th person.
   - It then computes a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. This is correct and efficiently computed in O(n) time.
   - The function initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates over the first `k` positions to find the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This is the correct approach because it considers the cost of moving Kirill to each of the first `k` positions and the cost of bribing all people between the current position and the target position.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value found, which is the correct output for the problem.

3. **Algorithm and Logic**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `k` positions.
   - The use of the suffix sum array `suff` ensures that the cost of bribing people between the current position and the target position is efficiently computed.
   - The logic of iterating over the first `k` positions and updating `ans` with the minimum cost is sound.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when `n` is equal to `k`.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should work within the given limits.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
