### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order, which is a good first step as it allows us to consider the smallest elements for removal and the largest elements for negation.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the optimal sum after Alice's and Bob's moves.
   - The initial sum `s` of the array is calculated.
   - The function then considers the sum of the last `negatives` elements (`s2`), which are the candidates for Bob to multiply by -1.
   - The function iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `removals`), updating the sum `s` and `s2` accordingly.
   - For each possible number of removals, it calculates the potential sum after Bob's negations and stores it in the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimality:**
   - Alice will remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob will multiply the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The function correctly calculates the sum after each possible number of removals and negations, ensuring that both players play optimally.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` or `x` is equal to `n` by considering all possible removals and negations.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` or `x` is 0 by not performing any removals or negations, respectively.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal sum for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for both Alice and Bob to play optimally and calculates the final sum of the array after their moves. The reasoning and the implementation are sound, and the program should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
