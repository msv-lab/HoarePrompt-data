The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calculates the product of the first `k` elements in the sorted list that are less than or equal to `x` using the function `func_2`. The product is printed for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function has no return value, but the variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` retain the values from the last test case.
