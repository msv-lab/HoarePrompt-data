To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`. The loop will execute if `removals` is at least 1, and `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `removals`.

Given the initial state:
- `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`).
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.
- `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.

For the loop to execute, `removals` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 1.

State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`**
