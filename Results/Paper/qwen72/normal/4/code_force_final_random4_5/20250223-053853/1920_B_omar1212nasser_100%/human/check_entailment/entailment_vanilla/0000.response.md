### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which are the least beneficial to the sum) and Bob to multiply the smallest elements by -1 (which minimizes the sum).

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum `s` of the array is calculated.
   - The sum of the last `x` elements `s2` is also calculated. This is used to determine the effect of Bob's operation.

4. **Alice's Removals:**
   - The program iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).
   - For each possible number of removals, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the smallest elements that Alice removes.
   - It also updates `s2` to reflect the changes in the sum of the last `x` elements after Alice's removals.

5. **Bob's Negations:**
   - For each possible number of removals, the program calculates the sum after Bob multiplies the smallest `x` elements by -1.
   - The effect of Bob's negations is calculated by subtracting twice the sum of the last `x` elements from the current sum `s`.

6. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum possible sum after considering all possible removals by Alice and negations by Bob.
   - It returns the maximum sum from the list `pos`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Alice's Strategy:**
  - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. The program correctly identifies these elements by sorting the array and removing the smallest elements.
  
- **Correctness of Bob's Strategy:**
  - Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The program correctly identifies these elements by considering the last `x` elements of the sorted array.
  
- **Combining Strategies:**
  - The program correctly combines both strategies by iterating over all possible removals and calculating the resulting sum after Bob's negations.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - If the array has only one element, the program correctly handles it by considering the removal of the element if `k` is 1.
  
- **Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by using a loop.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for both Alice's and Bob's optimal strategies. It handles the input and output correctly and processes each test case as described in the problem.
