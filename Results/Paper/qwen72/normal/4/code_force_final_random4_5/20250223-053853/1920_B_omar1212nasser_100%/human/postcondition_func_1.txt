The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns the maximum value from a list `pos` of `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` represents the sum of the integers in `elements` up to the point where `removals` elements have been removed from the end, minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements (also adjusted for the removed elements). The final state of the program is such that `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged, `elements` is not modified, and `pos` contains `removals + 1` elements, with the last element being the result of the final adjustment.
