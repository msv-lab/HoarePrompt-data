### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the integer `n` for the current test case.
   - It creates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a` using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces using `print(*a)`.

3. **Permutation Validity**:
   - The problem requires a permutation of length `n` such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.
   - The program generates a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices. This means that the first, third, fifth, etc., elements of the list are reversed while the second, fourth, sixth, etc., elements remain in their original positions.

4. **Verification**:
   - Let's consider the permutation generated by the program:
     - For `n = 4`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - Reversing the elements at even indices results in `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
     - For `n = 3`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Reversing the elements at even indices results in `[3, 2, 1]`.
   - We need to check if these permutations satisfy the condition:
     - For `n = 4`, the permutation `[3, 2, 1, 4]`:
       - `p[1] = 3` does not divide `p[3] = 1`.
       - `p[2] = 2` does not divide `p[4] = 4`.
       - `p[3] = 1` does not divide `p[1] = 3`.
       - `p[4] = 4` does not divide `p[2] = 2`.
     - For `n = 3`, the permutation `[3, 2, 1]`:
       - `p[1] = 3` does not divide `p[3] = 1`.
       - `p[2] = 2` does not divide `p[1] = 3`.
       - `p[3] = 1` does not divide `p[2] = 2`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program's approach of reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the elements at even indices are not in their original positions, which helps in breaking the divisibility condition.
   - For any `n`, the permutation generated by this method will ensure that no two elements at even indices and their subsequent elements will satisfy the divisibility condition.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program reads `n` inside the `func_1()` function, which means it will read `n` for each test case. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.
- The permutation generated by reversing the elements at even indices is a valid approach to ensure the divisibility condition is not met. This is because reversing the even indices disrupts the natural order of the sequence, making it less likely for the divisibility condition to hold.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**
