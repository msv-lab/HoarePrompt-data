Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of generating a permutation of length `n` such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. 

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads an integer `n` from the user input, which is the length of the permutation to be generated. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Permutation Creation**: The function creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`. This is a valid permutation of length `n`.

3. **Reversing Elements at Even Indices**: The function reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `a`. This step is intended to ensure that the permutation does not have the property where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct indices `i` and `j`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the modified list `a`.

To determine if the program is correct, we need to check if the permutation generated by the function satisfies the given condition. 

### Analysis of the Permutation:
- **Reversing Even Indices**: By reversing the elements at even indices, the function ensures that the elements at these positions are not in their natural order. This helps in breaking the divisibility pattern that might exist in the original list.

- **Divisibility Condition**: The key is to ensure that no two adjacent elements in the list can form a pair that satisfies the divisibility condition. By reversing the elements at even indices, the function effectively disrupts any potential divisibility patterns that might exist in the original list.

### Example Verification:
- For `n = 4`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`. This permutation does not have any pairs `(i, j)` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
- For `n = 3`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list remains `[1, 2, 3]` because there is only one even index. This permutation is valid as all permutations of length 3 are valid.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given condition. The approach of reversing elements at even indices is effective in breaking the divisibility pattern.
