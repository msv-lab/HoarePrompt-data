Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), with the elements at even indices reversed.

### Explanation:
1. **List `a` Construction**:
   - The list `a` is initially constructed as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed. This means the elements at these indices are swapped with the elements at the corresponding even indices from the end of the list.

2. **Reversing Even Indices**:
   - For example, if `n = 5`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The even indices are 0 and 2.
   - The elements at these indices are 1 and 3.
   - The elements at the corresponding even indices from the end are 5 and 3.
   - After reversing, the list `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

3. **General Case**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will have the elements at even indices reversed.
   - The first element (index 0) will be swapped with the last element (index `n-1`).
   - The third element (index 2) will be swapped with the third-to-last element (index `n-3`).
   - This pattern continues until all even indices are processed.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*a)
```
- The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the list `a` with elements at even indices reversed.

### Example:
- If `n = 5`, the list `a` will be `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- If `n = 6`, the list `a` will be `[6, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1]`.

### General Description:
- The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) will be reversed, meaning the first element will be swapped with the last, the third element with the third-to-last, and so on.

Output: **[n, 2, n-2, 3, n-4, 4, ..., 1] (where the elements at even indices are reversed in the list `a` from 1 to `n`)**
