### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case within a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` from input, and then reads the list `a` of cube values.
   - The index `f` is adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert it from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
   - The index `k` is also adjusted by subtracting 1 for the same reason.

2. **Sorting and Value Comparison:**
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored before sorting the list `a` in non-increasing order.
   - After sorting, the program checks if the value at position `k` in the sorted list `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `x`.

3. **Output Conditions:**
   - If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, it means the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes, so the output is "NO".
   - If `a[k]` is less than `x`, it means the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, so the output is "YES".
   - If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, the program checks if `k` is the last index of the sorted list or if the next element `a[k + 1]` is less than `x`. If either condition is true, the output is "YES". Otherwise, the output is "MAYBE".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is the last index of the sorted list correctly by checking `k == n - 1`.
   - It also handles the case where `a[k]` is equal to `x` and the next element `a[k + 1]` is less than `x` correctly.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of the program matches the problem description and handles all the given examples correctly.
