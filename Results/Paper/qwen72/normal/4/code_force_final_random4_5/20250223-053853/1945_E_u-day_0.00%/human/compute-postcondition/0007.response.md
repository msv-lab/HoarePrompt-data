To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables involved in this condition are `low` and `high`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. Substituting the values of `low` and `high` into the condition, we get:
- `0 + 1 < n - 1`
- `1 < n - 1`
- `2 < n`

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set, and `n` must be greater than 2**
