### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Variable `m` is Ignored**:
   - The problem description clearly states that the function should consider two integers `n` and `m`. However, the function `func_1` only reads `n` and `k` from the input, and `k` is not used in the computation. This means the program is not considering the second integer `m` at all, which is a critical part of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from 2 to the square root of `n`. This logic does not correspond to the problem's conditions. The problem requires finding pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but the function does not perform any such calculation.

3. **Test Case Failure**:
   - The specific test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     2 3

     Expected Output:
     3

     Actual Output:
     5
     ```
     - The valid pairs are indeed (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2), which satisfy the conditions. However, the program outputs 5, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the variable `m` and the logic inside the function does not match the problem requirements. The provided function `func_1` calculates a value that is unrelated to the problem's conditions, leading to incorrect outputs.
