The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, but only uses `n` for computation. It calculates a value `ans` which is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` in the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive, rounded up). The function then prints this calculated value `ans`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` is printed, and the variables `n`, `k`, and `root` are unchanged.
