Reasoning:

The program is incorrect based on the problem description. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided program does not implement this logic. Instead, it performs a different calculation that does not align with the problem's requirements.

Here are the specific issues:
1. **Function Signature and Parameters**: The function `func_1` should take two parameters, `n` and `m`, but it only reads `n` and `k` from input and uses `n` for computation. This is a mismatch with the problem's requirements.
2. **Calculation Logic**: The function calculates `ans` as the initial value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers `i` in the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive, rounded up). This calculation does not correspond to the problem's requirement of finding pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
