Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the program does not handle the variable `m` at all, and the logic inside the function does not match the problem requirements. For example, the program calculates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // cnt` for each `i` from 2 to the square root of `n`, which does not correspond to the problem's conditions.

A specific test case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
1
2 3

Expected Output:
3

Actual Output:
5
```

The expected output is 3 because the valid pairs are (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2). However, the program outputs 5, which is incorrect.
