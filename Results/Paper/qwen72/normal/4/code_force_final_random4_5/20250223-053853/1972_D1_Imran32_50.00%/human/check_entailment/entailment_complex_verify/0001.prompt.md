You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and m, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the initial value of n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i in the range from 2 to root (inclusive))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, but only uses `n` for computation. It calculates a value `ans` which is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` in the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive, rounded up). The function then prints this calculated value `ans`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` is printed, and the variables `n`, `k`, and `root` are unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \( 1 \le a \le n \)
     - \( 1 \le b \le m \)
     - \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (which should be \( m \) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \( n \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( n \) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \( i \) in the iteration, it calculates `cnt` as \( i \times i \).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Variable Naming**: The variable \( k \) in the function `func_1()` should be \( m \) to match the problem statement.
   - **Logic for Counting Pairs**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The expression \((n + i) // cnt\) does not correspond to the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - To correctly count the pairs, we need to iterate over all possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) and check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - A more efficient approach would be to use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) to reduce the number of iterations.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The variable naming issue and the incorrect logic for counting pairs make the program incorrect.
