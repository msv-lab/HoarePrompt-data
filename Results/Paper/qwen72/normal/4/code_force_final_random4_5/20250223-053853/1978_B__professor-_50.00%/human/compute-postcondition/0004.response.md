Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a`. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. Otherwise, it prints `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. The function does not return any value. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not stored or modified outside the loop, and the variable `t` remains unchanged after the loop execution. **
