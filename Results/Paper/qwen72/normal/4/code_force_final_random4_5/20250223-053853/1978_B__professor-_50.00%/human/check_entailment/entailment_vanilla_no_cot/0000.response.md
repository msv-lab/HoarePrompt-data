Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum profit when `b - a < n`. The formula used in the `else` block is incorrect. Let's break down the correct logic for this case:

1. **When `b <= a`:** The optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `n * a`.

2. **When `b > a` and `b - a >= n`:** The optimal strategy is to sell the first `n` buns at the modified price, which forms an arithmetic sequence from `b` to `b - n + 1`. The sum of this sequence can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **When `b > a` and `b - a < n`:** The optimal strategy is to sell the first `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price, and the remaining `n - (b - a + 1)` buns at the usual price `a`. The profit calculation should be:
   - Sum of the first `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price: \(\frac{(b - a + 1) \times (2b - (b - a + 1) + 1)}{2}\)
   - Sum of the remaining `n - (b - a + 1)` buns at the usual price: \((n - (b - a + 1)) \times a\)
   - Total profit: \(\frac{(b - a + 1) \times (b + a)}{2} + (n - (b - a + 1)) \times a\)

The provided program uses the incorrect formula in the `else` block:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```
This formula does not correctly account for the sum of the modified prices and the usual prices.

The correct formula should be:
```python
print(int((b - a + 1) * (b + a) / 2 + (n - (b - a + 1)) * a))
```

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a + 1) * (b + a) / 2 + (n - (b - a + 1)) * a))
```

This corrected program will correctly calculate the maximum profit for all test cases.
