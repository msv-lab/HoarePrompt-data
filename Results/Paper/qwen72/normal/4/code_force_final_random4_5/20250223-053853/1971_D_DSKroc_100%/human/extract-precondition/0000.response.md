Precondition: **The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is between 1 and 500 inclusive.** 

However, the function definition provided is:
```
def func():
```
This function definition does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function should be defined as:
```
def func(s):
```
With the precondition:
**s is a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1', and its length is between 1 and 500 inclusive.**
