You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    0

Output

    2
    2

    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a and b, which are binary strings consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the lengths of a and b (n and m respectively) are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function should return the maximum k for each test case, where k is the length of the longest prefix of a that is a subsequence of b.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `k` is the number of characters in `b` that match a character in `a` in the same order, and `j` is the index of the next character in `b` that has not been matched or `m` if all characters in `b` have been matched.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `b` that match a character in `a` in the same order)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates and prints the maximum length `k` of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes \( k \) (the length of the prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \)) and \( j \) (the index in \( b \) being checked) to 0.
3. **Loop Through \( a \)**: It iterates through each character in \( a \) (using the variable \( i \)).
4. **Find Matching Character in \( b \)**: For each character in \( a \), it searches for a matching character in \( b \) starting from the current index \( j \). If a match is found, it increments \( k \) and moves to the next character in \( b \) (by incrementing \( j \)).
5. **Break Condition**: If the end of \( b \) is reached without finding a match, it breaks out of the loop.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of \( k \), which represents the maximum length of the prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- When \( a \) is empty.
- When \( b \) is empty.
- When \( a \) and \( b \) are of different lengths.
- When \( a \) is a subsequence of \( b \) but not a prefix.
- When \( a \) is a prefix of \( b \).

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program works correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
