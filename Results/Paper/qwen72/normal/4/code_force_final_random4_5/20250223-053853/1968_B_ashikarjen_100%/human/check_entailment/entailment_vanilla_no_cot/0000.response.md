Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases and processes each case by determining the maximum length \( k \) such that the first \( k \) characters of string \( a \) form a subsequence of string \( b \). The logic in the `func_1` function iterates through each character of string \( a \) and finds the corresponding character in string \( b \) (if it exists), updating the index \( j \) in \( b \) and the count \( k \) accordingly. If the character is not found in \( b \), the loop breaks, and the function prints the value of \( k \). This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the maximum prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).
