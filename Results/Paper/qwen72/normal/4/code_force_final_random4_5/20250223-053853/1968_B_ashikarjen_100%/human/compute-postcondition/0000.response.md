Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input, each representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b` respectively, and `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5`. The function should still take two parameters: `a` and `b`, which are binary strings consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. The function should return the maximum `k` for each test case, where `k` is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.**
