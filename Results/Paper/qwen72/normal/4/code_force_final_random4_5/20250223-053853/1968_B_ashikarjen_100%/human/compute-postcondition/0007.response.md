To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to understand the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

- `k` is the number of characters in `b` that match a character in `a` in the same order.
- `j` is the index of the next character in `b` that has not been matched or `m` if all characters in `b` have been matched.

Given this information, the `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the count of characters in `b` that match characters in `a` in the same order.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the precondition, we can describe the value of `k` as follows:

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters in `b` that match a character in `a` in the same order)**
