Output State: **`t` is an input integer, h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w), and it is guaranteed that the initial positions do not coincide (x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b). Additionally, the function should be able to handle up to 10^4 test cases.**
