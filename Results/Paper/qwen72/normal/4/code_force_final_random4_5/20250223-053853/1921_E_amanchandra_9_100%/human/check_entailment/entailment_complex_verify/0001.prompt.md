You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description suggests that the function should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. The function should be modified to accept these parameters, and the precondition for these parameters is: h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w), and it is guaranteed that the initial positions do not coincide (x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b). Additionally, the function should be able to handle up to 10^4 test cases.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads a new set of inputs (r, w, a, b, c, d) and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of six integers: `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of two chips. The function determines the winner of a game based on the positions of the chips and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input values and the state of the program remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice starts at \((x_a, y_a)\) and can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob starts at \((x_b, y_b)\) and can move up, up-left, or up-right.
   - The game ends in a draw if either Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row.
   - The game ends in a win for Alice if she can place her chip on Bob's chip.
   - The game ends in a win for Bob if he can place his chip on Alice's chip.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - If \(x_a > x_b\), Alice is already below Bob, and Bob can move up to Alice's row. This means Bob can always force a draw or win by moving up to Alice's row and then moving horizontally to match Alice's column. Therefore, the game is a draw in this case.

3. **Optimal Moves:**
   - If \(x_a \le x_b\), we need to determine if Alice can force a win or if the game will end in a draw.
   - The key is to calculate the number of moves \(x\) it takes for Alice and Bob to potentially meet in the same row. This is given by \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{|x_a - x_b|}{2} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Horizontal Position Check:**
   - After \(x\) moves, Alice will be at \((x_a + x, y_a)\) and Bob will be at \((x_b - x, y_b)\).
   - We need to check if Alice can move to Bob's column in the next move. This means checking if \(y_a\) can be within the range \([y_b - (x + 1), y_b + (x + 1)]\) for Alice's move.
   - Similarly, we need to check if Bob can move to Alice's column in the next move. This means checking if \(y_b\) can be within the range \([y_a - x, y_a + x]\) for Bob's move.

5. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - If \(x_a + x = h\) (Alice is in the last row), the game is a draw.
   - If \(x_b - x = 1\) (Bob is in the first row), the game is a draw.
   - If \(x_a + x < h\) and \(x_b - x > 1\), we need to check the horizontal positions.

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the initial position check where \(x_a > x_b\) and outputs "Draw".
   - The program calculates \(x\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{|x_a - x_b|}{2} \right\rfloor\).
   - For odd \(|x_a - x_b|\), it calculates the range for Alice's possible moves and checks if Alice can win.
   - For even \(|x_a - x_b|\), it calculates the range for Bob's possible moves and checks if Bob can win.
   - The program uses the `print` function with a ternary operator to output the result based on the conditions.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial position check.
- The program correctly calculates the number of moves \(x\).
- The program correctly checks the horizontal positions for both Alice and Bob.
- The program correctly handles the boundary conditions for a draw.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
