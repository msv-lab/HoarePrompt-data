You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description suggests that the function should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. The function should be modified to accept these parameters, and the precondition for these parameters is: h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w), and it is guaranteed that the initial positions do not coincide (x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b). Additionally, the function should be able to handle up to 10^4 test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads a new set of inputs (r, w, a, b, c, d) and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts six parameters: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It returns "Alice" if Alice wins the game, and "Bob" if Bob wins the game, based on the initial positions and the rules of the game.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
