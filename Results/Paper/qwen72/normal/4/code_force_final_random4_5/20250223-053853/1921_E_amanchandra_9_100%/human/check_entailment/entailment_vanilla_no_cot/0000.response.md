Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Variable Naming and Logic**: The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not clearly named, which can lead to confusion. However, the main issue is in the logic used to determine the outcome of the game.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Draw Conditions**: The program incorrectly checks for draw conditions. Specifically, the logic for determining if Alice or Bob can win should be more precise. The current logic for `x = abs(a - c) // 2` and the subsequent checks are not correct.

3. **Incorrect Outcome Determination**: The program uses a complex and incorrect method to determine if Alice or Bob can win. The correct approach should consider the relative positions of the chips and the possible moves they can make.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If Alice's chip is already in the last row or Bob's chip is in the first row, it's a draw
        if x_a == h or x_b == 1:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            # Calculate the number of moves until Alice and Bob are in the same row
            moves = (x_b - x_a) // 2
            
            # Check if Alice can win
            if (x_b - x_a) % 2 == 1:
                # Alice can win if she can move to Bob's current column in the next move
                if abs(y_a - y_b) <= 1:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
            else:
                # Bob can win if he can move to Alice's current column in the next move
                if abs(y_a - y_b) <= 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial Draw Check**: If Alice's chip is in the last row (`x_a == h`) or Bob's chip is in the first row (`x_b == 1`), the game ends in a draw because neither can make a move that would result in a win.
2. **Moves Calculation**: Calculate the number of moves until Alice and Bob are in the same row. This is done by `(x_b - x_a) // 2`.
3. **Odd Number of Moves**: If the number of moves is odd, Alice will be the one to move into the same row as Bob. Alice can win if she can move to Bob's current column in the next move, which is checked by `abs(y_a - y_b) <= 1`.
4. **Even Number of Moves**: If the number of moves is even, Bob will be the one to move into the same row as Alice. Bob can win if he can move to Alice's current column in the next move, which is checked by `abs(y_a - y_b) <= 1`.

This corrected program should correctly determine the outcome of the game based on the given problem description.
