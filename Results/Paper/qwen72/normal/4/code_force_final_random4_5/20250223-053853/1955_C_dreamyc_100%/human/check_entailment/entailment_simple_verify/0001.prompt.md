You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have `n` ships, each with a durability `a_i`.
   - The Kraken attacks the ships in a specific pattern: first the first ship, then the last ship, and it repeats this pattern `k` times.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - A ship sinks when its durability reaches 0.
   - We need to determine how many ships sink after `k` attacks.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` (number of ships and number of attacks).
   - It reads the durability of each ship into a list `nums`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with `n`, `k`, and `nums` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of ships that sink.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Initial Check:**
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all `nums`, it means the Kraken will attack enough times to sink all ships. Therefore, the function returns `n`.
   - **Attack Pattern:**
     - The Kraken attacks the first ship and the last ship alternately.
     - The number of attacks on the first ship is `math.ceil(k / 2)` (let's call this `a`).
     - The number of attacks on the last ship is `k // 2` (let's call this `b`).
   - **Loop to Count Sunk Ships:**
     - The function iterates over each ship.
     - It accumulates the total durability of the first `i` ships in `s_a` and the total durability of the last `i` ships in `s_b`.
     - If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the first `i` ships have been attacked enough times to potentially sink, so `ans` is incremented.
     - If `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, it means the last `i` ships have been attacked enough times to potentially sink, so `ans` is incremented.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The logic in the loop is incorrect. The program is not correctly simulating the attack pattern.
   - The variables `s_a` and `s_b` are used to accumulate the total durability of the first and last `i` ships, but this does not accurately reflect the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The function should simulate the attacks one by one and check the durability of each ship after each attack.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - Use a queue (deque) to simulate the attack pattern.
   - Remove a ship from the queue when its durability reaches 0.
   - Keep track of the number of ships that sink.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly simulate the attack pattern and does not accurately count the number of ships that sink. It needs to be revised to correctly handle the alternating attacks and the removal of ships when they sink.
