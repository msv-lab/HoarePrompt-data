Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2, and `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `nums`.**

Explanation: The variables `a` and `b` are assigned new values based on the operations `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`, respectively. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`) remain unchanged, and the precondition that `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `nums` still holds.
