Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not properly account for the alternating nature of the attacks (first ship, then last ship, and so on) and the removal of ships that have sunk. Instead, it incorrectly sums the durability of the ships from the start and end, and checks if these sums are less than or equal to the number of attacks divided by 2 (for the first and last ship attacks). This approach does not accurately reflect the sequence of attacks and the state of the ships after each attack.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ships = deque(nums)
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and ships:
        # Attack the first ship
        if ships[0] <= k:
            k -= ships[0]
            ships.popleft()
            sunk += 1
        else:
            ships[0] -= k
            k = 0
        
        # If no more attacks or no more ships, break
        if k == 0 or not ships:
            break
        
        # Attack the last ship
        if ships[-1] <= k:
            k -= ships[-1]
            ships.pop()
            sunk += 1
        else:
            ships[-1] -= k
            k = 0
    
    return sunk
```

This corrected version uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships, simulating the Kraken's attacks by reducing the durability of the first and last ships in an alternating manner. It correctly handles the sinking of ships and the reduction of the number of attacks until either all ships have sunk or the Kraken has no more attacks left.
