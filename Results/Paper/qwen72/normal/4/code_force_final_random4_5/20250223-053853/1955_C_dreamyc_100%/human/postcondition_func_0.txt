The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`, which is the number of elements in `nums`. Otherwise, the function returns the sum of the count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` (where `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` (where `b` is `k // 2`) when counted from the end of the list. The final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, and the list `nums` remains unmodified.
