### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Total Durability**:
   - The function first checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities `sum(nums)`. If this is the case, all ships will sink, and the function correctly returns `n` (the total number of ships).

2. **Calculating Attack Cycles**:
   - The function then calculates `a` and `b`:
     - `a` is the number of attacks on the first ship in each cycle, which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
     - `b` is the number of attacks on the last ship in each cycle, which is `k // 2`.

3. **Iterating Over Ships**:
   - The function iterates over the list `nums` from the beginning and the end simultaneously.
   - For each ship `i`:
     - It adds the durability of the ship to `s_a` (sum of attacks on the first ship).
     - It adds the durability of the ship to `s_b` (sum of attacks on the last ship).
     - If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, it increments `ans` (number of ships sunk).
     - If `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, it increments `ans`.

4. **Final Return**:
   - The function returns `ans`, which is intended to be the number of ships sunk.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of `s_a` and `s_b`**:
  - The variables `s_a` and `s_b` are intended to keep track of the cumulative durability of the ships from the beginning and the end, respectively. However, the logic for determining when a ship sinks is flawed.
  - The current logic increments `ans` for each ship if the cumulative sum of attacks on the first or last ship is less than or equal to `a` or `b`, respectively. This does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern.

- **Correct Simulation of Kraken Attacks**:
  - The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last, and repeats. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1. When a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is no longer considered in subsequent attacks.
  - The current logic does not account for the fact that a ship can only be attacked once per cycle (first or last), and it does not correctly handle the removal of sunk ships from the list.

### Correct Approach:
- **Use a Deque for Efficient Removal**:
  - Use a deque to efficiently remove ships from the front and back.
  - Simulate the Kraken's attacks by alternating between the first and last ships until `k` attacks are made or all ships have sunk.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and the sinking of ships. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
