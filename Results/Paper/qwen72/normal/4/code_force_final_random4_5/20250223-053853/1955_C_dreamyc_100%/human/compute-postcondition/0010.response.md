The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`. `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. 

Case_1: The function returns the positive integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the list `nums`.

Case_2: The function returns the sum of the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` and the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. If the function returns based on Case_1, it returns the number of elements in the list `nums`. If the function returns based on Case_2, it returns the sum of the count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` and the count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list.**
