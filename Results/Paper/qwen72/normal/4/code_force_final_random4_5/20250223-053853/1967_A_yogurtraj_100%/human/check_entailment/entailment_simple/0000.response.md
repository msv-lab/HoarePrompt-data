### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` types of cards, and for each type `i`, we have `a_i` cards.
   - We can buy up to `k` new cards, and each new card can be of any type from 1 to `n`.
   - The goal is to rearrange the cards to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program sorts the list `a` to handle the cards in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list to determine how many cards of each type can be increased to form the maximum number of permutations.
   - The variable `r` is used to keep track of the minimum number of cards of any type after buying new cards.
   - The variable `rem` is used to store the remainder of coins after the last update.
   - The variable `y` is used to count the number of types that have more cards than the current minimum `r`.

3. **Key Steps:**
   - **Initial Setup:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - **Reading Input:** For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of card counts.
   - **Sorting:** The list `a` is sorted to facilitate the calculation of the minimum number of cards required.
   - **Iterative Update:** The program iterates through the sorted list to determine the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by spending `k` coins.
   - **Final Calculation:** If `k` is not exhausted, it updates `r` and calculates the final score. If `k` is exhausted, it calculates the score using the remaining variables.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the sorting and iterative updates to find the minimum number of cards that can be made equal.
   - The logic for updating `r`, `rem`, and `y` is correct and ensures that the maximum number of permutations is achieved.
   - The final score calculation is correct and takes into account the remaining coins and the number of types with more cards than the current minimum.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero correctly by not making any changes to the card counts.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is large enough to make all card counts equal to the maximum possible value.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The state comments and the final output state are consistent with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
