The function should take an integer X as input, where 2 <= X <= 10^18, and return either -1 if no such array exists, or a tuple (n, array) where n is the length of the array (1 <= n <= 200) and array is a list of integers of length n, with each element in the range [-10^9, 10^9], such that the array has exactly X increasing subsequences.
