Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three integers a, b, and c, each ranging from 0 to 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `q` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The variable `mn` remains unchanged at 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, which specifies the number of iterations to perform. For each of the `q` iterations, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The variable `mn` is initialized to 100 but remains unchanged throughout the function. The function does not return any value.
