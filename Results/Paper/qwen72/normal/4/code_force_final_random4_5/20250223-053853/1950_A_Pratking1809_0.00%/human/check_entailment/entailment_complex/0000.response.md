Reasoning:

1. **Function Structure and Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then iterates `q` times to process each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Reading Input for Each Test Case**: Inside the loop, the function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This is appropriate for the problem, as it ensures that the input is split into three integers.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The function checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is true. This correctly identifies a stair.
   - The function checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is true. This correctly identifies a peak.
   - If neither condition is true, the function prints 'NONE'. This correctly handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Variable `mn`**: The variable `mn` is initialized to 100 but is not used in the function. While it is unnecessary, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

5. **Output**: The function prints the correct output for each test case, which matches the problem description.

Given the above points, the function `func` correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
