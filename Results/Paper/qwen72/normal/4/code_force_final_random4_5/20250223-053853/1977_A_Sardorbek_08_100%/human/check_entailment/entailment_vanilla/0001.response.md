### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **If `b == c`**:
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes. If so, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. The program correctly prints "YES" in this case.
   - **If `b < c`**:
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If so, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes using only `b` moves. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - **If `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - This condition checks if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). This is a key insight because:
       - If `b` and `c` are both even, Nikita can alternate between adding and removing cubes to end up with `c` cubes.
       - If `b` and `c` are both odd, Nikita can also alternate between adding and removing cubes to end up with `c` cubes.
     - The program correctly prints "Yes" in this case.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it means that `b` and `c` have different parities, making it impossible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves. The program correctly prints "No" in this case.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct results for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
