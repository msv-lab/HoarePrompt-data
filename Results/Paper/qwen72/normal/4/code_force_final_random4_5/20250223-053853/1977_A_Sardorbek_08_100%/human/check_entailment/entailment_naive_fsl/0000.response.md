Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the case where `n` is greater than `m` and both `n` and `m` have the same parity (odd or even). According to the problem, if `n` is greater than `m` and both are of the same parity, it should be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the program prints "No" for such cases, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 3
```
The program should output "Yes" because after 5 moves, it is possible to have exactly 3 cubes in the tower (e.g., by adding 3 cubes and then removing 2 cubes). However, the program incorrectly outputs "No" for this case.
