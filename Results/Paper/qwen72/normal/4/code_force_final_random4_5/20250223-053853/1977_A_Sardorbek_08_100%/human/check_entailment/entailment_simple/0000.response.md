### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, then it is possible to build a tower with exactly `c` cubes by simply adding one cube per move. This condition is correctly handled.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. This condition is also correctly handled.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If the parity of `b` and `c` is the same (both are even or both are odd), then it is possible to build a tower with exactly `c` cubes. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the total number of cubes added or removed must have the same parity as the number of moves.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If the parity of `b` and `c` is different, it is impossible to build a tower with exactly `c` cubes. This is because the difference in the number of cubes added and removed must be even, but if `b` and `c` have different parities, this difference cannot be even.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if `b == c`, "NO" if `b < c`, "Yes" if `b % 2 == c % 2`, and "No" otherwise. The output is case-insensitive, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
