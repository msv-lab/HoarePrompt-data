### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and processes each test case by reading two integers `b` and `c`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: If `b` is equal to `c`, the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves `n` is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height.
   - **Case 2**: If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves made.
   - **Case 3**: If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1 per move, so the parity of the number of cubes will always match the parity of the number of moves. Therefore, if `b` and `c` have the same parity, it is possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.
   - **Case 4**: If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because if the parities are different, it is impossible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct results for each test case as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles all the given conditions and produces the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
