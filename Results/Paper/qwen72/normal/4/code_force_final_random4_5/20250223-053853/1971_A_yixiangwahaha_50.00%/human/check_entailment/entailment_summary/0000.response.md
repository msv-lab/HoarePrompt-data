Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases `t` but then proceeds to always process exactly 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This is a discrepancy from the problem description, which specifies that the number of test cases should be determined by the input `t`. The program will fail if `t` is not 10, as it will either read too many or too few test cases. Additionally, the program prints the integers with an extra space between them, which is not strictly necessary but does not affect the correctness of the output values.

Correctness: **False**
