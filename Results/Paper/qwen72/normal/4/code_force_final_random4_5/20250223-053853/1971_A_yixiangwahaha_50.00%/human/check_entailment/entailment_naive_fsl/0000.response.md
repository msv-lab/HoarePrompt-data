Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input specification. The problem description states that the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. However, the program always reads exactly 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will still attempt to read 10 test cases, which will result in an error. Conversely, if `t` is greater than 10, the program will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore the rest.

To correct this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` and then use a loop to read and process `t` test cases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, ' ', y)
        else:
            print(y, ' ', x)
```

This version will correctly handle any number of test cases within the specified range.
