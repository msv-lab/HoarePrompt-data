You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes 10 test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 9. It reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it in the function. For each test case, it prints the two integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value, and the lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input specification. The problem description states that the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. However, the program always reads exactly 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will still attempt to read 10 test cases, which will result in an error. Conversely, if `t` is greater than 10, the program will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore the rest.

To correct this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` and then use a loop to read and process `t` test cases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, ' ', y)
        else:
            print(y, ' ', x)
```

This version will correctly handle any number of test cases within the specified range.
