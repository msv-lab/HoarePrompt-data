Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `input()`. However, it does not use `t` in the subsequent loop, which is a mistake. The loop should iterate `t` times, not a fixed 10 times.

2. **Storing Inputs**: The program creates two lists `x` and `y` to store the inputs for each test case. This is unnecessary because the program can directly process each test case as it reads the inputs.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The program reads the inputs for each test case and splits them into two integers, `x[i]` and `y[i]`. It then appends these values to the lists `x` and `y`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum and maximum of `x[i]` and `y[i]` for each test case. This part of the logic is correct, but it should be done inside the loop that reads the inputs to avoid storing all inputs in lists.

5. **Fixed Loop Count**: The program uses a fixed loop count of 10, which is incorrect. The number of test cases can vary from 1 to 100, and the program should handle this dynamically based on the value of `t`.

6. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for printing the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` is correct, but the overall structure of the program is flawed due to the fixed loop count and unnecessary storage of inputs.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
