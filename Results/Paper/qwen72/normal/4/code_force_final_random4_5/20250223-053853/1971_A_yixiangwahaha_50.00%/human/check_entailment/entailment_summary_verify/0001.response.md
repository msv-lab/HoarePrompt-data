Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `input()`. However, it does not use this value `t` in the subsequent loop. Instead, it always iterates 10 times, which is a mistake. The loop should iterate `t` times to handle the correct number of test cases.

2. **Storing Inputs**: The program creates two lists `x` and `y` to store the inputs for each test case. While this is not strictly necessary for the problem, it does not inherently make the program incorrect. However, it is inefficient and can be simplified.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The program reads the inputs for each test case, splits them into two integers, and appends these values to the lists `x` and `y`. This part is correct but can be optimized by processing each test case immediately after reading it.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum and maximum of `x[i]` and `y[i]` for each test case. This part of the logic is correct and works as intended.

5. **Fixed Loop Count**: The program uses a fixed loop count of 10, which is incorrect. The number of test cases can vary from 1 to 100, and the program should handle this dynamically based on the value of `t`.

6. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for printing the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` is correct, but the overall structure of the program is flawed due to the fixed loop count and unnecessary storage of inputs.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The fixed loop count of 10 will cause the program to either process too many or too few test cases depending on the input value of `t`.

Final: **False**
