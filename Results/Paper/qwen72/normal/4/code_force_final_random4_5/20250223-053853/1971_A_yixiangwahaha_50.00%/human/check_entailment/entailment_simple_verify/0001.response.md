Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `input()`. However, it does not use this value `t` to determine the number of iterations in the subsequent loop. Instead, the loop always runs 10 times, which is incorrect. The loop should iterate `t` times to handle the variable number of test cases.

2. **Storing Inputs**: The program creates two lists `x` and `y` to store the inputs for each test case. While this is not strictly necessary, it does not inherently make the program incorrect. However, it does add unnecessary complexity and memory usage, which could be optimized.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The program reads the inputs for each test case and splits them into two integers, `x[i]` and `y[i]`. It then appends these values to the lists `x` and `y`. This part is correct, but it could be simplified by processing each test case immediately after reading it.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum and maximum of `x[i]` and `y[i]` for each test case. This part of the logic is correct. However, because the loop is fixed at 10 iterations, it will either process too many or too few test cases depending on the value of `t`.

5. **Fixed Loop Count**: The program uses a fixed loop count of 10, which is incorrect. The number of test cases can vary from 1 to 100, and the program should handle this dynamically based on the value of `t`.

6. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for printing the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` is correct, but the overall structure of the program is flawed due to the fixed loop count and unnecessary storage of inputs.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The fixed loop count of 10 will cause the program to fail for any input where `t` is not exactly 10. For `t < 10`, the program will read and process additional inputs that are not part of the test cases, and for `t > 10`, the program will terminate early without processing all test cases.

Final: **False**
