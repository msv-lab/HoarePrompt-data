Functionality: ** The function `func` processes 10 test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 9. It reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it in the function. For each test case, it prints the two integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value, and the lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
