The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. 

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and will start at 0**
