### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the list of ticket prices `a` from the second line.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The function sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the number of tickets bought per day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.
   - This is a valid step because if `m` is greater than `k`, you can only buy up to `k` tickets in a single day.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The function sorts the list of ticket prices `M` (which is a copy of `a`).
   - Sorting the prices is a crucial step because it allows the function to minimize the cost by buying tickets on the days with the lowest prices first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The function calculates `q` as the number of days needed to buy `k` tickets, using `math.ceil(k / m)`.
   - This is correct because it ensures that the number of days is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`.
   - This is correct because it ensures that the function is considering the days with the lowest prices.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, the function calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - This formula is correct because it accounts for the total cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days and the additional cost due to the price increase for each subsequent day.
   - If `n * m != k`, the function calculates the cost as follows:
     - It pops the last element from `N` and stores it in `w`.
     - It calculates the remaining tickets `mu` as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - It calculates the cost as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.
     - This formula is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the price increases for the remaining days. Specifically, the term `n * m * mu` is not necessary and can lead to an overestimation of the cost.

### Correctness:
- The function is mostly correct in its approach, but the cost calculation in the `else` block is flawed. The term `n * m * mu` is incorrect and should be removed.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)
        
        print(cost)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the variable `cost` has been calculated and printed, representing the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, with the maximum of `m` tickets purchasable each day. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` (the list of prices) retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop. The intermediate variables `L`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `w`, and `mu` are recalculated for each test case and do not persist outside the loop.
```

### Final Correctness:
- Correctness: **False**

The function is incorrect due to the flawed cost calculation in the `else` block. The term `n * m * mu` should be removed to correctly calculate the minimum cost.
