Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost by first sorting the ticket prices and then selecting the first `q` days to purchase tickets. However, the logic for calculating the cost is flawed.
   - The program assumes that the cost can be calculated by summing the prices of the selected days and then adding an adjustment based on the number of tickets purchased. This approach does not correctly account for the increase in ticket prices after each purchase.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Ticket Purchases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`).
   - The logic for popping the last element and adjusting the cost is incorrect and does not follow the problem's constraints.

3. **Incorrect Adjustment for Price Increases**:
   - The program's approach to adjusting the cost for the increase in ticket prices is incorrect. The increase in price should be applied to the remaining days, but the program does not correctly implement this.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Sort the Ticket Prices**:
   - Sort the ticket prices in ascending order to minimize the cost of purchasing tickets.

2. **Determine the Number of Days to Purchase Tickets**:
   - Calculate the number of days you need to purchase tickets to meet the total requirement of `k` tickets. This can be done using the formula `q = math.ceil(k / m)`.

3. **Calculate the Cost**:
   - For each of the `q` days, purchase as many tickets as possible (up to `m` tickets) and adjust the cost accordingly.
   - After each purchase, update the ticket prices for the remaining days by adding the number of tickets purchased to the price of each subsequent day.

4. **Handle the Remaining Tickets**:
   - If the number of tickets to be purchased is not a multiple of `m`, handle the remaining tickets separately by purchasing them on the last day.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def min_cost_to_buy_tickets():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the prices in ascending order
        prices.sort()
        
        # Calculate the number of days needed to purchase k tickets
        q = math.ceil(k / m)
        
        # Initialize the total cost
        total_cost = 0
        
        # Initialize the number of tickets purchased so far
        tickets_purchased = 0
        
        # Initialize the index for the prices list
        index = 0
        
        # Purchase tickets for each of the q days
        for day in range(q):
            # Determine the number of tickets to purchase on this day
            tickets_to_purchase = min(m, k - tickets_purchased)
            
            # Calculate the cost for this day
            total_cost += tickets_to_purchase * prices[index]
            
            # Update the number of tickets purchased
            tickets_purchased += tickets_to_purchase
            
            # Update the prices for the remaining days
            for i in range(index + 1, n):
                prices[i] += tickets_to_purchase
            
            # Move to the next day
            index += 1
        
        print(total_cost)

min_cost_to_buy_tickets()
```

This corrected program correctly handles the purchase of tickets and the adjustment of prices for subsequent days, ensuring that the total cost is minimized.
