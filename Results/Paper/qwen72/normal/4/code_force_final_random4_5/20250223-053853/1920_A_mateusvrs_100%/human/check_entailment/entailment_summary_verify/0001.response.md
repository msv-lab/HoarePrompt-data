### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `cx` is a set to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000000 + 7) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the function reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Values:**
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the function initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates over the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid values for `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Type 1 Constraints (k >= x):**
  - The function correctly updates `bx` to the maximum of the given `x` values. This ensures that `k` must be at least as large as the largest type 1 constraint.

- **Type 2 Constraints (k <= x):**
  - The function correctly updates `ax` to the minimum of the given `x` values. This ensures that `k` must be at most as large as the smallest type 2 constraint.

- **Type 3 Constraints (k != x):**
  - The function correctly adds these values to the set `cx`. This ensures that `k` must not be equal to any of the values in `cx`.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The function correctly checks if the range `[bx, ax]` is valid by comparing `bx` and `ax`. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it appends 0 to the result list `r`, indicating that no valid `k` exists.

- **Counting Valid Values:**
  - The function correctly calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1`.
  - It then subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range from the total count to get the number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound, and the function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

### Correctness:

Final: **True**
