The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints. The function accepts an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, with `a` indicating the type of constraint and `x` the value involved. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided, but the specific output for each case is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of test cases, each with a set of constraints, and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each with a set of constraints, and returns a result for each test case.**
