Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Frequencies**: It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of problems needed to be created.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. For each difficulty level `i`:
     - If `i` is not in the `Counter` `hmp`, it means there are no problems of that difficulty level, so it adds `m` to `ans` (since `m` rounds are needed and each round requires one problem of each difficulty level).
     - If `i` is in `hmp` but the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to account for the missing problems of that difficulty level.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of problems needed to be created for each test case.

The logic and implementation are correct and match the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
