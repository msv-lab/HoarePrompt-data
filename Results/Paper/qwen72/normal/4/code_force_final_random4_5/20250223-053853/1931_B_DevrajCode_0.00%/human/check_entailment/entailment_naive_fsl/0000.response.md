Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The input format expects multiple test cases, but the program only processes a single test case. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the input format, as it should read each test case separately and output the result for each test case.

For example, if the input is:
```
6
1
43
2
1 3
5
4 5 2 1 3
3
1 2 3
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```

The program will only process the first test case and will not correctly handle the subsequent test cases. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to handle multiple test cases and output the result for each one.
