Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The problem specifies that the input will contain multiple test cases, but the program only reads and processes a single test case.

Additionally, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in each container and the target amount of water ever becomes negative. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. The correct approach is to check if the maximum amount of water in any container is less than or equal to the target amount plus the total amount of water that can be poured from the containers with more water than the target to the containers with less water.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of containers and the amounts of water in each container.
3. Calculate the target amount of water (which is the total water divided by the number of containers).
4. Check if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring that the maximum amount of water in any container does not exceed the target amount plus the total excess water that can be distributed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    max_water = max(a)
    if max_water > target * 2:
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input data at once and splits it into a list.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: It processes each test case by reading the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
3. **Calculating Target**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have.
4. **Checking Feasibility**: It checks if the maximum amount of water in any container is less than or equal to twice the target amount. This is because the maximum amount of water any container can have after pouring is the target amount plus the excess water from other containers.
5. **Storing Results**: It stores the result for each test case in a list.
6. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
