### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the specified pouring operation.
   - The total amount of water is divisible by `n`, ensuring a target amount of water per container can be calculated.
   - The operation can only pour water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - To achieve the target amount in all containers, the cumulative difference in water amounts from the target should remain non-negative as we move from left to right. This is because if the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means we need more water to reach the target, which is not possible with the given constraints.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total water and the target amount of water per container.
   - It iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference (`container`).
   - For each container, it updates the cumulative difference by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It assumes the first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The function `func_1` is logically correct for a single test case.
   - The issue lies in the input handling, which only processes the first test case and does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest.

Final: **False**
