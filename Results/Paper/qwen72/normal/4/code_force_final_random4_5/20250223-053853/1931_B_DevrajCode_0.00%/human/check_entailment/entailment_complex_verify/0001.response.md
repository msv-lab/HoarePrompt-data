### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`, ensuring that a target value `target = total_water // n` can be calculated.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water per container is `total_water // n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from a container with more water to a container with less water, but only in the direction from left to right (`i < j`).
   - To achieve the target amount in all containers, the cumulative difference in water amounts from the target must remain non-negative as we move from left to right. If it becomes negative, it means we need more water to reach the target, which is not possible given the constraints.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total water and the target amount of water per container.
   - It iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference (`container`).
   - For each container, it updates the cumulative difference by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.
   - The algorithm is logically sound and correctly implements the necessary checks for a single test case.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It assumes the first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - However, the program only processes the first test case and ignores the rest. This is a significant issue because the problem statement clearly requires handling multiple test cases.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm itself is correct for a single test case. It correctly checks if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring the cumulative difference remains non-negative.
   - The issue lies in the input handling, which only processes the first test case and ignores the rest. This means the program will not produce the correct output for multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest. This is a critical flaw that affects the overall correctness of the program.

Final: **False**
