Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any container to a container with a higher index. The key observation here is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, the average amount of water per container can be achieved. However, the operation constraint (i < j) means that water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

The function `func_1` calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total water divided by the number of containers. It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative sum (`container`) of the differences between the current water amount and the target amount. If at any point this cumulative sum becomes negative, it means that more water has been poured out than can be compensated by the remaining containers, making it impossible to achieve the target amount in all containers. If the cumulative sum remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it indicates that the target amount can be achieved.

However, there is a logical error in the function. The function assumes that if the cumulative sum becomes negative at any point, it is impossible to balance the water. This is not always correct. For example, consider the case where the first few containers have less water than the target, but the later containers have significantly more water that can compensate for the earlier deficit. The function should instead check if the final cumulative sum is zero, which would indicate that the water can be balanced across all containers.

Given the current implementation, the function will incorrectly return 'No' in some cases where it is actually possible to balance the water. Therefore, the function is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
