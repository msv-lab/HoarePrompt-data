Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The function then processes these strings to find the smallest index `k` such that the substring `a[:k+1]` is a subsequence of `b`. It prints this index `k` for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged for each test case. The input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are consumed and reset for each iteration of the outer loop. **
