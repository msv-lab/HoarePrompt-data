The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns different outputs based on the input values:
- Case_1: If `t` is outside the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function returns an error message.
- Case_2: For each test case, if `n` is outside the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, the function returns an error message.
- Case_3: For each test case, if any `a_j` is outside the range 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, the function returns an error message.
- Case_4: If all inputs are within their valid ranges, the function processes the list `a` and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. If `t` is outside the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it returns an error message. For each test case, if `n` is outside the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 or any `a_j` is outside the range 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it processes the list `a` and returns a result for each test case.**
