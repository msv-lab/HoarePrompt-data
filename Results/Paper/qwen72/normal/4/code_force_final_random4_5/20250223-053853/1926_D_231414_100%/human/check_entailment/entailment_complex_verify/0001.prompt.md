You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    #State: The variable `times` is decremented to 0. The variable `check` is reset to 2147483647 at the start of each iteration. The variable `ans` is printed after each iteration and is reset to 0 for the next iteration. The dictionary `dic` is cleared at the end of each iteration. The variables `n` and `data` are updated with new input values in each iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). The function then computes the number of unique integers in the list `a` after applying a specific transformation (XOR with `2^31 - 1`) and prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no remaining state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to group integers such that no two integers in the same group have the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.
   - This means that for any two integers \( x \) and \( y \) in the same group, \( x_2(i) \neq y_2(i) \) for all \( 1 \leq i < 32 \).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If two integers \( x \) and \( y \) have the same bit value in all 31 bits, they cannot be in the same group.
   - The maximum number of such unique bit patterns is \( 2^{31} \), but since we are only considering the 31 least significant bits, the maximum number of unique patterns is \( 2^{31} \).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \( n \) and the list of integers \( data \).
   - It initializes a dictionary \( dic \) to keep track of the bit patterns and a variable \( ans \) to count the number of groups.
   - The variable \( check \) is set to \( 2^{31} - 1 \), which is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.
   - For each integer \( i \) in \( data \):
     - It computes \( s = i \oplus check \). This operation flips all the bits of \( i \) because \( check \) is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.
     - If \( i \) is already in the dictionary, it decreases the count of \( i \) in the dictionary. If the count reaches zero, it removes \( i \) from the dictionary.
     - If \( i \) is not in the dictionary, it checks if \( s \) is in the dictionary. If \( s \) is not in the dictionary, it adds \( s \) to the dictionary and increments the group count \( ans \).

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies the bit patterns by using the XOR operation with \( check \).
   - However, the logic for updating the dictionary and counting the groups is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the condition where two integers should not have the same bit value in any of the 31 bits.
   - The program assumes that if \( i \) is already in the dictionary, it can be removed and the group count should not be incremented. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the remaining integers in the dictionary do not have the same bit value in any of the 31 bits.
   - The program also does not handle the case where multiple integers with the same bit pattern are present in the input.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that no two integers in the same group have the same bit value in any of the 31 bits.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
