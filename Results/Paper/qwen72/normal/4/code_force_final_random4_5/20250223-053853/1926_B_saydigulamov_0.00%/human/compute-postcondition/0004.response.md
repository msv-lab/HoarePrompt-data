Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, it prints the list `k`. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variable `a` retains its initial value, which is the number of test cases, and the list `k` is reset for each test case. **
