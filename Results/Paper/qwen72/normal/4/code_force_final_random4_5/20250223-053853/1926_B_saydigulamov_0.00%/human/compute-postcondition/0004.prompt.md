You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines of n characters each, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: The variable `a` retains its initial value, which is the number of test cases. The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and appends these counts to the list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, `k` is printed. After all iterations, `a` remains unchanged, and `k` is reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's. It outputs the shape (either "triangle" or "square") that includes all the '1's in the grid for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
