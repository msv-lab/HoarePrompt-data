#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines of n characters each, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: The variable `a` retains its initial value, which is the number of test cases. The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and appends these counts to the list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, `k` is printed. After all iterations, `a` remains unchanged, and `k` is reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, it prints the list `k`. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variable `a` retains its initial value, which is the number of test cases, and the list `k` is reset for each test case.
