Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square. It only checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows are the same, which is insufficient to determine the shape. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2
11
11
3
111
111
111
```

For the first test case, the program should output "SQUARE" because the grid contains a 2x2 square. However, the program will print the list `[2, 2]` instead of the correct output.

For the second test case, the program should output "SQUARE" because the grid contains a 3x3 square. However, the program will print the list `[3, 3, 3]` instead of the correct output.

The program fails to handle these cases correctly and does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
