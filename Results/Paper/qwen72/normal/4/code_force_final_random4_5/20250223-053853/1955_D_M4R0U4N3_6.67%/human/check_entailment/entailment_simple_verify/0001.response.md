### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b` and initializes the necessary sets and counters.
   - The initialization of `todo` with the elements of array `b` is correct.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` and checks if each element is in `todo`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - After this initial check, it determines if the first subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` starting from the second subsegment.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It removes the element `a[r - m]` from the previous window.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `extra`, it is simply removed.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
   - It then checks if the new element `a[r]` is in `todo`.
     - If it is, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
     - If it is not, it is added to `extra`.
   - The program checks if the current subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Initial Subsegment Check:**
  - The program correctly initializes `todo` with the elements of `b`.
  - It then iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
  - The initial check to see if the first subsegment is good by comparing the length of `done` to `k` is correct.

- **Correctness of Sliding Window Updates:**
  - The sliding window approach is implemented correctly.
  - When the window slides, the program correctly removes the element that is no longer in the window.
  - If the removed element was in `extra`, it is simply removed.
  - If the removed element was in `done`, it is moved back to `todo`.
  - The program then adds the new element to the window and updates `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
  - The check to see if the current subsegment is good by comparing the length of `done` to `k` is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where `k` is 1 or `m` correctly.
  - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` have duplicate elements correctly.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` ensures that the operations (addition, removal, and membership check) are efficient (O(1) on average).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. The sliding window approach is implemented correctly, and the program efficiently counts the number of good subsegments.
