The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range defined by the input. For the loop to execute, the input provided to the `range` function must be a positive integer. This integer corresponds to the number of test cases `t` that the function should process. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer, and the loop variable `_` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4)**
