### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b` and initializes the necessary sets and counters.
   - The initialization of `todo` with the elements of array `b` is correct.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` and checks if each element is in `todo`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - After this initial check, it determines if the first subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` starting from the second subsegment.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It removes the element `a[r - m]` from the previous window.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `extra`, it is simply removed.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
   - It then checks if the new element `a[r]` is in `todo`.
     - If it is, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
     - If it is not, it is added to `extra`.
   - The program checks if the current subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial Subsegment Check:**
  - The initial subsegment check is correct. It correctly identifies the elements of the first subsegment of length `m` and updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
  - The initial count `ans` is set to 1 if the first subsegment is good, otherwise 0.

- **Sliding Window Approach:**
  - The sliding window approach is implemented correctly. It efficiently updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as the window slides through the array `a`.
  - The removal of the old element `a[r - m]` and the addition of the new element `a[r]` are handled correctly.
  - The program correctly checks if the current subsegment is good by verifying if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when `k` is equal to `m` correctly.
  - It also handles cases where there are duplicate elements in `a` and `b` correctly.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. It correctly implements the sliding window approach and maintains the necessary sets to count the number of good subsegments.
