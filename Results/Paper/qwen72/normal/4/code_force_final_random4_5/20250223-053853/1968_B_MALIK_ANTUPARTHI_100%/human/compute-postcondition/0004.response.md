Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` and two binary strings `d` and `e` from the input. It then calculates the smallest index `k` such that the substring of `d` up to index `k` can be found in `e` starting from the current position `k`. If the substring is not found, `k` is set to the current index `j`. The function prints the value of `k` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the value of `a` is decremented to 0, and `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are undefined. The function does not return any values. **
