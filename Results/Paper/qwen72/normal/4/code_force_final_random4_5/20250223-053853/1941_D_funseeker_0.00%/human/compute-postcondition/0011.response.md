Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts no parameters but uses the integers `n`, `m`, and `x` (where `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`) provided by the function `func_3`. It computes a set `ans` containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`, where `r` and `c` are values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration. If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the length of the set `ans` and the elements of the set `ans`. **
