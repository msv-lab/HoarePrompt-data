### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This is a common utility function for reading input.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line from standard input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_4` processes each test case. It reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw. This is done by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise movements if the direction is unknown (`?`), and only the specified direction if it is known (`0` or `1`).

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the ball could be with player `0` (which should be interpreted as player `n` in a 1-indexed circle). This is done by checking if `0` is in the set `ans` and replacing it with `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

### Analysis of the Functions:

- **`func_1`**: Reads a line from standard input and strips it. This is correct for reading input.
- **`func_2`**: Reads the number of test cases. This is correct.
- **`func_3`**: Reads and parses the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`. This is correct.
- **`func_4`**: Processes each test case. The logic for updating the set `ans` is correct. It considers all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw, and it correctly handles the edge case where the ball could be with player `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the given constraints and edge cases. The functions work together to read the input, process the throws, and output the correct results.

### Correctness:
**True**
