Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration, but `0` is no longer in the set, and `n` is added to the set.**
