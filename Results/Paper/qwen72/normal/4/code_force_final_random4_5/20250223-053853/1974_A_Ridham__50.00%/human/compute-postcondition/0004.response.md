To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- The `result` list contains the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop.
- The length of the `result` list is equal to `n`, the number of iterations.
- The variables `x` and `y` will have the values of the last input provided.
- `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` will be calculated based on the last values of `x` and `y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`result` List**: The `result` list contains the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop. Each element in this list is an integer representing the number of screens needed for that particular iteration.
2. **`map(str, result)`**: This function converts each element in the `result` list to a string.
3. **`'\n'.join(...)`**: This function joins all the string elements of the `result` list with a newline character (`\n`), effectively creating a single string where each element of the `result` list is on a new line.
4. **`print(...)`**: This function prints the resulting string to the console.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list on a new line. Since the exact values of `result` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `result`.

Output: **[result[0]]
[result[1]]
...
[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is the number of screens required for the i-th iteration of the loop)**

This means that the output will be a series of numbers, each on a new line, representing the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop. The exact values of these numbers depend on the calculations performed during the loop based on the values of `x` and `y` provided in the input.
