Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect due to a few logical errors in how it calculates the number of screens required. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `screen_require_for_y`**:
   - The program calculates `screen_require_for_y` as `y // 2` if `y` is even, and `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. This is incorrect because a 2x2 icon can be placed on a single screen, and it should take up 4 cells, not half a screen or more.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `remaining_cells`**:
   - The program calculates `remaining_cells` as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is incorrect because it assumes that each 2x2 icon requires a full screen, which is not the case. A 2x2 icon can be placed on a single screen, and the remaining cells on that screen can be used for 1x1 icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `extra_screen`**:
   - The program calculates `extra_screen` as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons can be utilized for 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons**:
   - Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `ceil(y * 4 / 15)`, where `ceil` is the ceiling function.

2. **Calculate the remaining cells on these screens**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on these screens can be used for 1x1 icons. The remaining cells are `15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4`.

3. **Calculate the number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons**:
   - The remaining 1x1 icons can be placed on the remaining cells of the screens used for 2x2 icons. If there are still 1x1 icons left, additional screens are needed. The number of additional screens required is `ceil(remaining_1x1_icons / 15)`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y * 4 / 15)
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        remaining_1x1_icons = max(0, x - remaining_cells)
        extra_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1_icons / 15)
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + extra_screens_for_1x1
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program should correctly determine the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
