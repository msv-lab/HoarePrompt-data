The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function may interact with or process a set of test cases where each test case contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200). The function's output is not specified, so it is unclear what the function returns. 

Given the lack of explicit parameters and the unclear output, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be fully determined from the provided information. However, based on the constraints, it is reasonable to infer that the function processes these integers in some way, but the exact return value is unknown.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), but the exact return value is not specified.**
