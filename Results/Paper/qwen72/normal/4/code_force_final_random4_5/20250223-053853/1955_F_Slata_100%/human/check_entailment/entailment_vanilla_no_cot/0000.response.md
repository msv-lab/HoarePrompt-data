Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading four integers (counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).

2. **Winning Condition**: The program aims to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The key to this is understanding the bitwise XOR properties:
   - XOR of an even number of 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s results in 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s results in a non-zero value.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - Removing pairs of the same number (1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s) will not change the XOR result because the XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - If there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s combined, Bob can win by ensuring that the sequence has an even number of these numbers after each removal.

4. **Calculation**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the number of pairs that can be removed without changing the XOR result.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s combined. If there are, it adds 1 to the count, indicating that Bob can win one more time by removing one of these numbers to make the total even.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
