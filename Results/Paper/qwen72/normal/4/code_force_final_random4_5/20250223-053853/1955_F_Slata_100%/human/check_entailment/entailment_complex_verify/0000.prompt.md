You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each of the four integers p_i in the test cases is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input, then print the result of the expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`. The value of `t` will remain unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be read from the input for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. It then calculates the sum of the integer division of each of these four integers by 2, and adds 1 to the sum if exactly three of the first three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) are odd. The result of this calculation is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are no longer relevant as they are read and processed for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed. The program calculates the number of times Bob can win by summing the half of the counts of each type of number and adding a condition based on the parity of the counts. However, this approach does not always yield the correct result.

Consider the following counterexample:
Input:
```
1
0 2 0 0
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Actual Output:
```
1
```
However, for another input:
Input:
```
1
0 3 0 0
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Actual Output:
```
0
```
In the second example, the program incorrectly outputs 0 instead of 1. Bob can win once if Eve removes one of the twos, leaving the sequence with two twos, which results in a bitwise XOR of 0 (since 2 XOR 2 = 0). This shows that the program does not handle all cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
