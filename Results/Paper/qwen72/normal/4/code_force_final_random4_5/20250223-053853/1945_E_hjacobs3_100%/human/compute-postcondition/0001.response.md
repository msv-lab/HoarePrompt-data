Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.**

The initial state remains unchanged, except that the variables `l` and `r` have been assigned specific values. `l` is now 0, and `r` is now equal to the length of `array`, which is `n`.
