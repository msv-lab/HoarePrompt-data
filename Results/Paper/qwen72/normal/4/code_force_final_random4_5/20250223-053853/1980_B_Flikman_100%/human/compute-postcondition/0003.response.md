The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the length of the list `a`. `f` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n, representing specific indices or values within the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the input data for each test case. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `f` and `k` are integers within the range of `a`. The function returns a result based on the provided test cases and the specific values or indices `f` and `k` within the list `a`.**
