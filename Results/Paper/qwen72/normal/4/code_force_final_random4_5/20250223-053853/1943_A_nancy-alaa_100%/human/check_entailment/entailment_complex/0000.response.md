### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns picking elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which she builds by picking elements from `a`), while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the final score is the MEX of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX, but he cannot pick the same integer that Alice has just picked.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` or the smallest integer `i` that appears exactly once in `arr` after the first such integer has been found.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `n` is read for each test case.
     - `arr` is read as a list of integers.
     - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
     - `first` is a boolean flag initialized to `False`.

   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - The loop iterates through integers from 0 to `n`.
     - If `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and the MEX is `i`. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `True`, it means this is the second unique integer found, and the MEX is `i`. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True` to track the first unique integer found.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` and prints it.
   - If all integers from 0 to `n` are present, it correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that appears exactly once in `arr` after the first such integer has been found.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by resetting the variables for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr` and the MEX is `n`.
   - The program handles the case where there are multiple unique integers in `arr` and correctly prints the smallest one after the first unique integer has been found.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It processes each test case correctly and prints the expected output.

**Correctness: True**
