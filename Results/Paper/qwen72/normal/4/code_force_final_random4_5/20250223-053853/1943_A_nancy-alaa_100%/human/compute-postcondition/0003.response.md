The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the processed result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns the result of processing each test case.**
