### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing integer by removing it from `a` if it is present.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from `0` to `n` to find the MEX of `c`.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The program checks if an integer `i` is not in the `Counter` `mpp`. If it is not, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, which is the correct MEX.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is `1`, the program checks if `first` is `True`. If `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The `first` flag is used to track if Alice has already picked an element that is unique in `arr`.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice will always pick the smallest unique element first to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will always pick the smallest unique element if it is available to minimize the MEX.
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest missing integer or the smallest unique integer that Alice can pick, ensuring the optimal play for both players.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are unique and the case where some elements are repeated.
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the final MEX of the array `c`. It efficiently finds the smallest missing integer or the smallest unique integer that Alice can pick, ensuring the correct final score.

### Correctness:
**True**
