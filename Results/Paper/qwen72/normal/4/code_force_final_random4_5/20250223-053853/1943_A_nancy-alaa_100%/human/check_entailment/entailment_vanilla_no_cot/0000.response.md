Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. The optimal strategy involves both players trying to influence the MEX of the array `c` in their favor. However, the provided program does not fully capture this strategy.

### Issues:
1. **Handling of `first` Variable:**
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether an element with a count of 1 has been encountered. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. The game should be played in turns, and the decision of which element to pick should be based on the current state of the array and the optimal strategy for both players.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The correct approach is to consider the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` and to ensure that Alice and Bob make moves that align with their goals. The program does not correctly simulate this turn-based optimal strategy.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game in a way that both players play optimally. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        # Alice and Bob will play optimally
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if mpp[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                if (n - i) % 2 == 1:
                    mex = i
                    break
        print(mex)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
1. **Count the Elements:**
   - We use a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

2. **Determine the MEX:**
   - We iterate through the range from 0 to `n` to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in the array `arr` (i.e., `mpp[i] == 0`).
   - If `i` is not in the array, it becomes the MEX.
   - If `i` is in the array but has a count of 1, we check if the number of remaining elements (i.e., `n - i`) is odd. If it is odd, Alice will have the last turn and can ensure that `i` is not in the final array `c`, making `i` the MEX.

This approach correctly simulates the optimal strategy for both players and ensures that the MEX is calculated based on their actions.
