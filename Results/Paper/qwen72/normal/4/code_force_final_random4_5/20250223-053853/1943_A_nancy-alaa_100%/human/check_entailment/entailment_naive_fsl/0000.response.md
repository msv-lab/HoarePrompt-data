Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` contains multiple elements that are not present in the array `c` and where the MEX is not the first missing element. Specifically, the program only checks for the first missing element and the first element that appears exactly once, but it does not consider the optimal strategy for both players to maximize or minimize the MEX.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6
0 1 2 2 3 3
```
The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 2. Now `a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 3]` and `c = [2]`.
2. Bob picks 0. Now `a = [1, 2, 3, 3]` and `c = [2]`.
3. Alice picks 1. Now `a = [2, 3, 3]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
4. Bob picks 2. Now `a = [3, 3]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
5. Alice picks 3. Now `a = [3]` and `c = [2, 1, 3]`.
6. Bob picks 3. Now `a = []` and `c = [2, 1, 3]`.

At the end, `c = [2, 1, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` is 0. However, the program will output 2, which is incorrect. This is because the program does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both Alice and Bob.
