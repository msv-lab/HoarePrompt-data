The only objects in the loop head are the variables `itest` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `itest` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `itest` is 0**
