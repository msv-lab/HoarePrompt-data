You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:

- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with no arguments, and it is expected to handle input and output internally. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of parts of the ribbon, the number of colors available, and the number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each test case, the output will either be 'NO' or 'Yes' based on the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` will not be directly modified by the loop, but `itest` will have the value `t` after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters and handles input and output internally. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of parts of a ribbon (`n`), the number of colors available (`m`), and the number of parts Bob can repaint (`k`). For each test case, it checks if it is possible to repaint up to `k` parts of the ribbon such that the number of contiguous parts of the same color can be maximized. If the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` are met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer relevant.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice uses all `m` colors to paint the ribbon, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. This is because `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that must be the same color if Alice uses all `m` colors optimally. If Bob can repaint more than `n - math.ceil(n / m)` parts, he can always achieve his goal.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The condition `n <= k` is correct because if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is also correct. This condition ensures that Bob can always repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, even if Alice uses all `m` colors optimally.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and `k = 1`.
   - It also handles cases where `n` is much larger than `k` and `m`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and the logic are sound and cover all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
