### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice uses all `m` colors to paint the ribbon, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. This is because `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that must be the same color if Alice uses all `m` colors optimally. If Bob can repaint more than `n - math.ceil(n / m)` parts, he can always achieve his goal.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The condition `n <= k` is correct because if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is also correct. This condition ensures that Bob can always repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, even if Alice uses all `m` colors optimally.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and `k = 1`.
   - It also handles cases where `n` is much larger than `k` and `m`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and the logic are sound and cover all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
