Precondition: **The function should be called with no arguments, and it is expected to handle input and output internally. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of parts of the ribbon, the number of colors available, and the number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.**
