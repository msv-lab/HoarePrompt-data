### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.

2. **Logic for Determining the Output:**
   - The program uses two conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color:
     - `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that are not the most frequent color is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this is true, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, the answer is `Yes`.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - The condition `n <= k` is straightforward and correct.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is more complex but can be understood as follows:
     - `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the same color if Alice uses all `m` colors equally.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` gives the number of parts that are not the most frequent color.
     - If this number is less than `k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or `m` is 1.
   - For `n = 1`, the answer is always `NO` because Bob can repaint the single part.
   - For `m = 1`, the answer is always `NO` because Alice can only use one color, and Bob can always repaint all parts to that color.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case, either `NO` or `Yes`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The conditions used are mathematically sound and handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
