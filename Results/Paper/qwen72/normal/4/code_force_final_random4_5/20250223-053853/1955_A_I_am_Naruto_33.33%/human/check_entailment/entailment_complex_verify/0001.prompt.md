You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the output is the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n > 1`, or simply `a` if `n == 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. For each test case, if `n > 1`, it calculates the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` and prints this minimum value. If `n == 1`, it simply prints `a`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were provided in the input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading the inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program directly prints the price `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price. This is correct.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buys any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

4. **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
   - `ans1` is straightforward and correct.
   - `ans2` is calculated by:
     - `b * (n // 2)`: This is the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - `a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost for buying the remaining `n % 2` yogurts at the regular price. If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so this term is 0. If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so this term is `a`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - `min(10, 9) = 9` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
     - `min(15, 14) = 14` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
     - `min(15, 16) = 15` (Correct)
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
     - `min(20, 22) = 20` (Correct)

Based on the above reasoning and verification, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
