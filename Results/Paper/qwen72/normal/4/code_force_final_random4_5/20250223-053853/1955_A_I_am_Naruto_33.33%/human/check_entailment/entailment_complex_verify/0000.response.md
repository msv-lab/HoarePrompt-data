### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - This is consistent with the problem description and the annotated code.

2. **Single Yogurt Case**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints `a`, which is the correct price for one yogurt.
   - This is handled correctly in the code with the `else` block.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
   - The program calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`).
   - It calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price (`ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is even, `n % 2` will be 0, and the formula `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` will correctly calculate the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs.
   - When `n` is odd, `n % 2` will be 1, and the formula will correctly add the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price.
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 1, as it directly prints `a`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `2 5 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - `min(10, 9) = 9`
   - For the test case `3 5 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
     - `min(15, 14) = 14`
   - For the test case `3 5 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
     - `min(15, 16) = 15`
   - For the test case `4 5 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
     - `min(20, 22) = 20`

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description and constraints. It correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, whether `n` is 1 or greater than 1, and whether `n` is even or odd.

Final: **True**
