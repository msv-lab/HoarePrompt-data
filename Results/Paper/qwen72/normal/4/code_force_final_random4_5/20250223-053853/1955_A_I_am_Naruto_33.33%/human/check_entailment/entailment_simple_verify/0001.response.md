Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading the inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program directly prints the price `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price. This is correct.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price. This is correct.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buys any remaining yogurts at the regular price. This is also correct.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

4. **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
   - `ans1` is straightforward and correct.
   - `ans2` is calculated by:
     - `b * (n // 2)`: This is the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - `a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost for buying the remaining `n % 2` yogurts at the regular price. If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so this term is 0. If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so this term is `a`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - `min(10, 9) = 9` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
     - `min(15, 14) = 14` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
     - `min(15, 16) = 15` (Correct)
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
     - `min(20, 22) = 20` (Correct)

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound.

Final: **True**
