### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

2. **Base Case (n == 1)**: 
   - If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price.
   - This is handled by the `else` block, which prints `a` when `n == 1`.

3. **General Case (n > 1)**:
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - For `n > 1`, the program correctly calculates the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

5. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The formula `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` ensures that Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - This formula is mathematically correct and aligns with the problem statement.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the correct output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically and mathematically correct and handles all edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
