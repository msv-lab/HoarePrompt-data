The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function may interact with or use external variables or inputs (such as `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) that are defined elsewhere in the code. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with specific ranges. The function's output is not clearly specified, but it is expected to produce some result based on these inputs.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function definition, we can infer that the function's primary role is to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function should return a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not provided.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
