### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and then reads and sorts the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Truncation:**
   - The list `a` is sorted and truncated to the first `n` elements.
   - The list `b` is sorted in reverse order and truncated to the first `m` elements. This is a bit redundant since `b` is already of length `m`.

3. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted list `a` and the first `n` elements of the sorted list `b` (in reverse order).
   - It calculates the absolute difference between each corresponding pair of elements and appends the result to the list `ans`.
   - If at any point, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `temp` to the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Adjustment for Maximum Difference:**
   - If `temp` is set to a non-negative value, it means that for some index `i`, the difference `|a[i] - b[-(n - i)]|` is greater than `|a[i] - b[i]|`.
   - In this case, the function continues to calculate the differences using `b[-(n - i)]` for the remaining elements starting from index `temp`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \).
- Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
- The function checks if using the reverse order of `b` for some elements can yield a larger difference, and if so, it switches to using the reverse order for the remaining elements.

### Potential Issues:
- The function sorts `b` in reverse order and then truncates it to the first `m` elements, which is unnecessary since `b` is already of length `m`.
- The function could be more efficient by directly using the reverse order of `b` without truncation.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor inefficiency in sorting and truncating `b`, the logic of the function is correct and should produce the maximum total difference \( D \) as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
