Output State: **The loop executes for each test case, and for each test case, it prints the sum of the absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and elements of the sorted list `b` (in reverse order if necessary). The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged, but the lists `a` and `b` are sorted and possibly truncated to the lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The list `ans` is populated with the absolute differences and then cleared for the next test case. The variable `temp` is used to determine the point at which the loop should switch to using elements from the end of `b` instead of the beginning.**
