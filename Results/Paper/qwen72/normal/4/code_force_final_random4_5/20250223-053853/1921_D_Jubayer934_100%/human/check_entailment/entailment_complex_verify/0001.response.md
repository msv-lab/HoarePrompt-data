### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and then reads and processes the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order, which is correct.
   - The array `b` is sorted in descending order and then truncated to the first `m` elements. However, the truncation to `m` elements is redundant because `m` is always at least `n`, and we only use the first `n` elements of `b` in the subsequent calculations. This step can be simplified to just sorting `b` in descending order and taking the first `n` elements.

3. **Initial Difference Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It also initializes a variable `temp` to -1, which is used to track the point where the difference calculation should switch from using the largest elements of `b` to the smallest elements of `b`.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The function iterates over the first `n` elements of `a` and `b`.
   - For each element `i` in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` and `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
   - If the difference with `b[-(n - i)]` is greater, it sets `temp` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it appends the difference with `b[i]` to the `ans` list.

5. **Switching Difference Calculation:**
   - If `temp` is not -1, it means that at some point, the difference with the smallest elements of `b` became larger.
   - The function then iterates from `temp` to `n` and appends the differences with `b[-(n - i)]` to the `ans` list.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the function prints the sum of all differences in the `ans` list.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the differences.
  - This ensures that the largest possible values in `b` are used to maximize the differences with the smallest values in `a`, and vice versa.

- **Difference Calculation:**
  - The function correctly calculates the differences and checks if switching to the smallest elements of `b` would yield a larger difference.
  - The use of `temp` to track the switching point is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same as `a` (e.g., the second test case where all elements are 1).
  - It also handles the case where `m` is exactly equal to `n` (e.g., the third test case).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting operations are efficient given the constraints (`n` and `m` are up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).
  - The overall complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\) due to the sorting, which is acceptable for the given constraints.

### Verification with Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are correctly described and remain unchanged.

- **State After Sorting:**
  - `a` is sorted in ascending order.
  - `b` is sorted in descending order and truncated to the first `n` elements (since `m` is always at least `n`).

- **State During Difference Calculation:**
  - The differences are calculated correctly, and the switching point is determined appropriately.

- **State After Difference Calculation:**
  - The `ans` list is populated with the correct differences, and the sum is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). The steps are well-justified, and the edge cases are handled appropriately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
