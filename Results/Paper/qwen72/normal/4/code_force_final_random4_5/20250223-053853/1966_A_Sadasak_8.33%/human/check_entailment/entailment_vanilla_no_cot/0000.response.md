Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Case When `k > n`:**
   - The program prints `n` when `k > n`. This is correct because no operations can be performed if `k` is greater than `n`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of the Case When `k == n`:**
   - The program prints `k - 1` when `k == n`. This is incorrect. If `k == n`, you can perform the operation exactly once, exchanging all `n` cards for `k-1` cards, so the result should be `k - 1`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of the General Case:**
   - The program prints `k - 1` if any frequency in the `freq` dictionary is exactly `k`. This is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
   - The program prints `n` if none of the frequencies are exactly `k`. This is also incorrect. The correct approach should be to determine the minimum number of cards left by considering the frequencies of the cards.

4. **Incorrect Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` limits the frequency of any number to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because it does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach should be to count the actual frequencies and use them to determine the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- For each card number, determine how many full operations can be performed and how many cards will be left after these operations.
- Sum the remaining cards to get the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        min_cards_left = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards_left += count % k
        
        print(max(1, min_cards_left))
```

### Explanation:
- **Frequency Calculation:** We count the frequency of each card number using a dictionary.
- **Minimum Cards Left:** For each card number, we calculate the remainder when the frequency is divided by `k`. This remainder represents the number of cards that cannot be part of a full operation.
- **Final Output:** We sum these remainders to get the total number of cards left. If the sum is zero, we return 1 because at least one card must be left.

This corrected program should correctly determine the minimum number of cards left for each test case.
