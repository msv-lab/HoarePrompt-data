Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible. If there are multiple such strings, any one of them can be returned.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The resulting string `s` is then printed.

3. **Evaluating the Solution**:
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` lowercase alphabets `n` times. This means `s` will be of length `k * n`.
   - The string `s` will indeed contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets because every possible combination of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets will appear in `s` due to the repetition.
   - However, the solution does not necessarily produce the shortest possible string. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `baab` is shorter than `aabb` and still contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the solution generates a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - The original assessment also correctly identifies that the solution does not always produce the shortest possible string, which is a requirement of the problem.
   - The function `func_1` should accept `n` and `k` as parameters, but it currently reads them from input inside the function, which is not ideal for testing and modularity.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not always generate the shortest possible string that satisfies the problem's requirements. The requirement is to find the shortest string, and the current implementation does not guarantee this.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect** because it does not always generate the shortest possible string that satisfies the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
