The function `func_1` accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the string `b`, starting from index `j`. If the character `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from index `j`, the function returns -1.
