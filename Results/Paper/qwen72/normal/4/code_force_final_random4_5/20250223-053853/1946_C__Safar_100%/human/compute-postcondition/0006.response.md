To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the variables `l` and `r` that are part of the loop condition `l <= r`.

- The state right before the loop is: `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to node `i` in the tree. `n` and `k` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is equal to `n // k`.

- The loop condition is `l <= r`. For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.

- Currently, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n // k`. For the loop to execute, `r` must be at least 1 (since `l` is 1).

- Therefore, `n // k` must be greater than or equal to 1. This implies that `n` must be at least `k` (since integer division of `n` by `k` should result in a value of 1 or more).

- Since `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `l` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `l`.

- The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `r` is at least 1, which is already satisfied if `n` is at least `k`.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, given that `n` is at least `k`.

State: **`g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to node `i` in the tree. `n` and `k` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is equal to `n // k` and `n` must be at least `k`**
