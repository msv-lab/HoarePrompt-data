To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the conditions `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i` are both satisfied when the loop starts. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Condition 1: `i <= m`**
   - `i` is 1.
   - For the condition to be true, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Condition 2: `i * i <= n + i`**
   - `i` is 1, so `i * i` is 1.
   - The condition becomes `1 <= n + 1`.
   - Simplifying, this means `0 <= n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is 0.

We need to adjust `n` and `m` to ensure the loop can execute at least once. Specifically:
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Since `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, we can assume that `func_7()` can return values that satisfy these conditions. However, for the purpose of this task, we need to explicitly state the conditions that must be met.

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
