Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`.** 

Explanation: The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_7()`. The initial constraint that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 remains valid, but the specific values of `n` and `m` are now determined by the function `func_7()`.
