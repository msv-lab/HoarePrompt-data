The function `func_2` reads a line of input from stdin, which is expected to contain space-separated integers, and returns a map object that contains these integers converted to integer type. The function does not take any input parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the map object is ready to be used, for example, by converting it to a list or iterating over it to access the integers.
