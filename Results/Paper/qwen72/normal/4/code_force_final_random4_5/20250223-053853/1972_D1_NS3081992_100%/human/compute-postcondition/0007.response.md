Functionality: ** The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` such that `0 <= n <= len(a)`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference `(m - a[i])`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The list `a`, integer `n`, and integer `m` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
