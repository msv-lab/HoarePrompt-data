Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the n×n matrix using no more than 2n operations. The program's output for the maximum sum is incorrect, and the operations it performs do not achieve the desired maximum sum.

### Explanation:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum sum as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an n×n matrix, where each row and column can be filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to n, is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`. This is because each permutation of 1 to n has a sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and there are n rows and n columns, so the total sum is `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program performs 2n operations, where for each row and column, it assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`. This is not the optimal way to maximize the sum.
   - The correct approach is to use the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row and column, which will ensure that each element in the matrix is a distinct integer from 1 to n, and the sum is maximized.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
  - The correct maximum sum is calculated as `n * n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- **Operations**:
  - The program performs 2n operations, where for each row and column, it assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This ensures that each element in the matrix is a distinct integer from 1 to n, and the sum is maximized.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described.
