Reasoning:

1. **Formula for Maximum Sum**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used to calculate the maximum sum, `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, is incorrect.
   - The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). This is because each row and column will contain the numbers from 1 to \( n \), and there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, so the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The correct maximum sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
     - The program calculates the maximum sum as \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 7 \), which is indeed incorrect.

3. **Operations**:
   - The operations performed by the program are correct. For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) and a Type 2 operation on column \( i \), both using the permutation from \( n \) down to 1.
   - This ensures that each row and each column will contain the numbers from 1 to \( n \), which is a valid way to fill the matrix.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct. It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves in the required format.

5. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit of \( 2n \).

Given the above points, the primary issue with the program is the incorrect formula for calculating the maximum sum. The operations themselves are correct and will fill the matrix as required, but the sum calculation is flawed.

Final: **False**
