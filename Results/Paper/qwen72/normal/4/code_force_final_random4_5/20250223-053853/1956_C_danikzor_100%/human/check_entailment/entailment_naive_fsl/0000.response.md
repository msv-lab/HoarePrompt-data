Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix for every potential case. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the maximum sum, `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

For example, consider the case where \( n = 2 \):
- The correct maximum sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
- However, the program calculates the maximum sum as \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 7 \), which is incorrect.

Additionally, the operations performed by the program are correct in terms of filling the matrix with permutations, but the sum calculation is flawed, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
