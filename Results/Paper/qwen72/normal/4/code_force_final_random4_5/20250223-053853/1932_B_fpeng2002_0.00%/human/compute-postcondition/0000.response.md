The code snippet `num_tests = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `num_tests`. The input is expected to be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, as per the precondition. The list of lists for the test cases is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, the list of lists for the test cases remains unchanged.**
