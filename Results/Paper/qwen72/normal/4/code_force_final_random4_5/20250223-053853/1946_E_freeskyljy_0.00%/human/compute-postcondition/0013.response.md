Output State: **`N` is an integer, `M1` is an integer, `M2` is an integer, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers provided by the input, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, either `M1` is less than or equal to 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` taken `L[-1] - 1` at a time, `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**
