Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input, where `N` is an integer, `M1` is an integer, and `M2` is an integer; `L` is a list of integers.** 

The initial state indicates that `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned values from the input, and the code snippet `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input and converts it into a list of integers. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged, and `L` is now a list of integers.
