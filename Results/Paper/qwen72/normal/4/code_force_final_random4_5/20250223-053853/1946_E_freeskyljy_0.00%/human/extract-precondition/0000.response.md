Precondition: **The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, the number of suffix maximums, and the lists of indices for the prefix and suffix maximums.**

However, based on the problem description, the correct function definition should be:
```
def count_permutations(t, cases):
```
Where `cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `prefix_max_indices`, and `suffix_max_indices`.

For the sake of the precondition, let's assume the function is defined correctly as:
```
def count_permutations(t, cases):
```

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains five elements: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), m_1 (1 ≤ m_1 ≤ n), m_2 (1 ≤ m_2 ≤ n), prefix_max_indices (a list of m_1 integers in increasing order, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and suffix_max_indices (a list of m_2 integers in increasing order, 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
