The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, the function checks if the string `c` is either identical to `a` or `b`, or contains any character that is not present in both `a` and `b`. If `c` is identical to `a` or `b`, or if it contains a character not found in both `a` and `b`, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variable `i` holding the value `tests - 1`, `slength` holding the last `n` value, and `a`, `b`, and `c` retaining the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any test case resulted in a 'YES' or 'NO' being printed, otherwise it will be `True`.
