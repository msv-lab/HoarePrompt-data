The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it should handle an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function should return the result of processing these test cases, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It processes these test cases and returns the result of the processing, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
