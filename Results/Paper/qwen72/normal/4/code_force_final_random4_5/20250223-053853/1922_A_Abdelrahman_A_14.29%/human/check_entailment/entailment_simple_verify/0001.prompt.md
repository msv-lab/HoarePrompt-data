You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the actual implementation should handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The variable `i` will have the value `tests - 1` after the loop finishes executing all iterations. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' or 'NO' being printed, otherwise it will be `True`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `slength` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If it is, it immediately prints "NO" and sets `no` to `False`. This is correct because if `c` is identical to `a` or `b`, it is impossible to find a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

3. **Template Matching**:
   - The program then iterates through each character `x` in `c`.
   - It checks if `x` is not present in `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" and sets `no` to `False`, breaking out of the loop.
   - This logic is incorrect. The presence of a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b` does not guarantee that a valid template exists. The template must ensure that for each position `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` match the template, and the character in `c` does not match the template.

4. **Correct Template Matching**:
   - To determine if a valid template exists, we need to check each position `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must have this character in lowercase.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template must have an uppercase character that is not the lowercase version of `c[i]`.
   - The program does not perform this detailed check.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - For each position `i`, we need to ensure:
     - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`.
     - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, and there exists an uppercase character that is not the lowercase version of `c[i]`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly determine the existence of a valid template. It only checks if there is any character in `c` that is not present in `a` or `b`, which is not sufficient to ensure the template conditions are met. A more detailed position-wise check is required to determine the correctness of the template.
