Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers representing the number of ships and the number of Kraken attacks (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `a` is a list of integers representing the durability of each ship (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
