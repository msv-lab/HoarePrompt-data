#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of the 2 × n grid. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        ans = ''
        
        i = 0
        
        work = True
        
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        counter = 1
        
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(counter)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations for the given number of test cases `t`. For each test case, the variable `ans` contains a string that is a result of alternating characters from the two input strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `counter` contains the length of the longest contiguous sequence of characters in `a` and `b` where each character in `a` (starting from the second character) is either equal to the previous character in `b` or follows the pattern '0' in `a` and '1' in `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `work`, and `j` are reset or updated as necessary for each test case, and the final values of `ans` and `counter` are printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also calculates and prints the length of the longest contiguous sequence of characters in `a` and `b` where each character in `a` (starting from the second character) is either equal to the previous character in `b` or follows the pattern '0' in `a` and '1' in `b`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
