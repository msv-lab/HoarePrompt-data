Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `s` of `n` integers. For each integer in `s`, the function maps it to a corresponding character in the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and constructs a string `r`. The function then prints the string `r` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the list `b` contains the count of how many times each character in the alphabet string was used in the output strings `r`. The function does not return any value. **
