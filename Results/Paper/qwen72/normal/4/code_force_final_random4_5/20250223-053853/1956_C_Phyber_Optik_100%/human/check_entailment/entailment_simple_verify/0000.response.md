### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i
     \]
   - Simplifying the term inside the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the formula becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
     \]
   - Expanding the sum:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - The sum of squares of the first \( n \) integers is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
     \]
   - The sum of the first \( n \) integers is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Substituting back:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1 - 3)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n-2)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)2(n-1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(n-1)}{3}
     \]
   - This formula is incorrect for the maximum sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations. The correct maximum sum should be:
     \[
     \text{sum} = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     \[
     \text{sum} = 2 \times \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 6
     \]
   - The program outputs 7, which is incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program generates \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation fills a row or a column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), the operations are:
     \[
     1 2 1 2
     2 2 1 2
     1 1 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     \]
   - These operations do not fill the matrix with the maximum possible values. The correct configuration to achieve the maximum sum of 6 would be:
     \[
     2 2
     2 2
     \]
   - The current operations do not achieve this configuration.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum for all potential cases, and the operations generated do not always result in the maximum sum.

Final: **False**
