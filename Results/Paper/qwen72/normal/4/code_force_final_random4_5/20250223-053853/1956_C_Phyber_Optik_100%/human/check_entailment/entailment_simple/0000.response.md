Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve either assigning a permutation to a row or a column.

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \).
   - Simplifying the formula inside the sum: \( i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1 \).
   - Therefore, the formula becomes \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \).
   - This can be further simplified to \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \).
   - The sum of \( 2i^2 \) from \( i=2 \) to \( n \) is \( 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 \), and the sum of \( i \) from \( i=2 \) to \( n \) is \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \).
   - The sum of squares \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \), and the sum of integers \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \) and \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \).
   - Substituting these into the formula gives:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n+2 - 3)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n - 1)}{6}
     \]

2. **Operations**:
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations for each test case.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - Each Type 1 operation assigns the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to a row.
   - Each Type 2 operation assigns the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to a column.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is set to a value between 1 and \( n \), and each value appears exactly once in each row and column.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated sum and \( 2n \) as the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations, which are valid and within the limit of \( 2n \).

The sum calculation and the operations are both correct and meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
