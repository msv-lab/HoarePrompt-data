### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`.
   - If `a >= b`, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` is more profitable. Therefore, it prints `n * a`.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - The formula `k = min(b - a + 1, n)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a modified price without making the modified price less than the usual price `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total profit for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Arithmetic Series Sum:**
  - The formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
  - This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S = \frac{k}{2} \times (a_1 + a_k) \), where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( a_k \) is the last term.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When `a >= b`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price.
  - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the optimal `k` and the corresponding profit.

- **Large Inputs:**
  - The program handles large inputs (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently. The arithmetic operations and the use of `int` for division ensure that the results are accurate and within the integer range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering both the usual price and the modified price promotion. It handles all edge cases and large inputs efficiently.
