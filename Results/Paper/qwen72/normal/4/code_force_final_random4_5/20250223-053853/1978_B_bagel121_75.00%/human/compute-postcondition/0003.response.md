The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are integers, and they must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the specified range and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9 and returns a value based on these inputs.**
