You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: n, a, and b, where n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated based on the input provided for each iteration of the loop. The variable `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. The loop will print a result for each iteration, but the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be reset to the next input values for the next iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the values provided in the last input, and `t` will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. It then calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` and a value `p2`, and prints their sum. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the values provided in the last test case, while `t` will be 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`.
   - If `a >= b`, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` is more profitable. Therefore, it prints `n * a`.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - The formula `k = min(b - a + 1, n)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a modified price without making the modified price less than the usual price `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total profit for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Arithmetic Series Sum:**
  - The formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
  - This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S = \frac{k}{2} \times (a_1 + a_k) \), where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( a_k \) is the last term.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When `a >= b`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price.
  - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the optimal `k` and the corresponding profit.

- **Large Inputs:**
  - The program handles large inputs (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently. The arithmetic operations and the use of `int` for division ensure that the results are accurate and within the integer range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering both the usual price and the modified price promotion. It handles all edge cases and large inputs efficiently.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
