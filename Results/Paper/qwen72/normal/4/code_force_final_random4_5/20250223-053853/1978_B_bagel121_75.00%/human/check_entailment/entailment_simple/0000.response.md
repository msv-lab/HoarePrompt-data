### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. It then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, reading three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Condition Check**: The function checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If this condition is true, it means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is more profitable than using the modified price. In this case, the function prints `n * a`, which is the total profit from selling all buns at the usual price. This is correct based on the problem description.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation**: If `a` is less than `b`, the function calculates the optimal value of `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This is because the modified price can only be applied up to `b - a + 1` times (since the price of the buns decreases from `b` to `a`), and it cannot exceed the total number of buns `n`. This ensures that the modified price is used as much as possible without going below the usual price `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`. The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series is given by `k * (first_term + last_term) / 2`.
   - The function then calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns as `(n - k) * a`.
   - Finally, it prints the total profit, which is the sum of the two calculated profits.

5. **Output**: The function prints the total profit for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, calculates the optimal `k`, and computes the maximum profit for each test case. The logic and arithmetic used are correct and align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
