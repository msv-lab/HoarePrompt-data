### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Cases Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is more profitable than using the promotion. Therefore, the function prints `n * a`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the function calculates the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is chosen to be `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which ensures that the modified prices are used as much as possible without exceeding the number of buns `n`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\). This formula correctly calculates the sum of the prices from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as \((n - k) * a\).
   - The total profit is the sum of the two parts and is printed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` correctly by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - The function also handles the case where `b` is much larger than `a` by using the modified price for as many buns as possible.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to `b - a + 1` by setting `k` to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct profit for each test case, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset for the next test case.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the given program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
