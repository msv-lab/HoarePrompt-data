### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices, which is appropriate for Python lists.

3. **Initial Score Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct as per the problem description.

4. **Score and Position Update:**
   - The function iterates `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - On each turn, it updates the positions `b` and `s` based on the permutation `p`.
   - It also updates the scores `bp` and `sp` by adding the corresponding values from `a`.

5. **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
   - The lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     are incorrect. The scores `bm` and `sm` should be updated by adding the value of `a` at the current position, not by using a complex `max` function. The `max` function here does not align with the problem's rules, which state that the score increases by `a_x` and then the player either stays or moves to `p_x`.

6. **Correct Score Calculation:**
   - The correct way to update the scores should be:
     ```python
     bm += a[b]
     sm += a[s]
     ```

7. **Final Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the function correctly compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner and prints the result.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        
        bm = a[b]  # Initial score for Bodya
        sm = a[s]  # Initial score for Sasha
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1  # Update Bodya's position
            s = p[s] - 1  # Update Sasha's position
            bm += a[b]  # Update Bodya's score
            sm += a[s]  # Update Sasha's score
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- **False**

The original program contains a logical error in the score calculation, which affects the final outcome. The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct behavior.
