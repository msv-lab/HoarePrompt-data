To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `p` is a permutation of length n with elements 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n.
- `a` is an array of length n with elements 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
