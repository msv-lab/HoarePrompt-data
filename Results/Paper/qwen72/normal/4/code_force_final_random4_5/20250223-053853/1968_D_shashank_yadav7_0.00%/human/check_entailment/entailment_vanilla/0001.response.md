### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from each.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes the scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) based on their starting positions.
   - It also initializes the maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) as the initial scores multiplied by `k`.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by moving them to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively.
   - It updates the scores by adding the value at the current position in `a` to the respective player's score.
   - The program then updates the maximum possible scores for each player. However, this part of the code is incorrect because it uses a formula that does not accurately reflect the game rules. The formula `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is not correct for the game's score calculation.

4. **Score Comparison:**
   - After the simulation, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
  - The program incorrectly updates the maximum possible scores using a formula that does not match the game rules. The correct approach should be to simply add the value at the current position in `a` to the respective player's score for each turn.
  - The use of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is not necessary and does not align with the game's rules.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for j in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        # Compare the final scores
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** due to the flawed score calculation logic.
- The corrected program accurately simulates the game and correctly determines the winner based on the provided rules.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
