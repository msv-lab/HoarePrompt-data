You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (number of cards and number of cards exchanged during each operation) and a list of integers `l` (the numbers on the cards). The function then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are not stored or used after the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - You need to find the minimum number of cards left in your hand after performing the operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` cards with any number.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of cards left.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `l`.
   - It then prints `k - 1` for each test case.

3. **Identifying the Issue**:
   - The program does not actually process the list of card numbers `l` to determine the minimum number of cards left.
   - It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, you need to count the frequency of each card number.
   - For each unique card number, determine how many full operations can be performed and how many cards will be left after those operations.
   - The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of the remainders of the card counts when divided by `k`.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case: `n = 5`, `k = 3`, `l = [4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`
     - Frequency of 4: 3 (can perform 1 operation, 0 cards left)
     - Frequency of 1: 2 (cannot perform any operation, 2 cards left)
     - Total cards left: 2
   - For the second test case: `n = 1`, `k = 10`, `l = [7]`
     - Frequency of 7: 1 (cannot perform any operation, 1 card left)
   - For the third test case: `n = 7`, `k = 2`, `l = [4, 2, 1, 100, 5, 2, 3]`
     - Frequency of 4: 1 (cannot perform any operation, 1 card left)
     - Frequency of 2: 2 (can perform 1 operation, 0 cards left)
     - Frequency of 1: 1 (cannot perform any operation, 1 card left)
     - Frequency of 100: 1 (cannot perform any operation, 1 card left)
     - Frequency of 5: 1 (cannot perform any operation, 1 card left)
     - Frequency of 3: 1 (cannot perform any operation, 1 card left)
     - Total cards left: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 (but the correct answer is 1, as shown in the example)

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the frequencies of the card numbers and the operations that can be performed.
