Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations described.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the frequency of each card number and determine how many cards can be exchanged to minimize the number of cards left. The correct approach involves:

1. Counting the frequency of each card number.
2. Determining the minimum number of cards that cannot be fully exchanged for each card number.
3. Summing up these minimum numbers to get the final answer.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        from collections import Counter
        freq = Counter(l)
        
        min_cards_left = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards_left += count % (k - 1)
        
        if min_cards_left == 0 and n % (k - 1) == 0:
            min_cards_left = k - 1
        
        print(min_cards_left)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each card number and then computes the minimum number of cards that cannot be fully exchanged. If the total number of cards is a multiple of `k-1` and no cards are left, it ensures that at least `k-1` cards are left as the final answer.
