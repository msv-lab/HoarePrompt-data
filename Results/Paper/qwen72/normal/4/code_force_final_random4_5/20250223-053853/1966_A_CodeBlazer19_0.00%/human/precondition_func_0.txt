The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, k)` where `n` is the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the number of cards exchanged during each operation (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and the second element is a list of integers `[c_1, c_2, ..., c_n]` representing the numbers on the cards (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).
