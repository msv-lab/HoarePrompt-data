Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it should accept the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as described in the problem.
   - The function reads input directly from `input()`, which is not ideal for a function that should be reusable with different inputs. It should accept the inputs as parameters.

2. **Logic for Solving the Problem**:
   - The program prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations.
   - The program does not perform any operations or calculations to determine the minimum number of cards left. It simply prints `k - 1`, which is not the correct solution for any of the test cases provided in the example.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program does not store or use the values of `n`, `k`, and `l` after reading them. It should process these values to compute the correct result.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- Use these frequencies to determine how many operations can be performed and how many cards will be left after all possible operations.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
