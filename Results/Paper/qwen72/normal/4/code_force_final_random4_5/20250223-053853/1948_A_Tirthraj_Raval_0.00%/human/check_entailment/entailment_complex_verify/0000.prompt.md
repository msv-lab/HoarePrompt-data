You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, if `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed followed by a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` is not retained after each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from the input, representing the number of special characters required in the string. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the given problem for every potential case. It checks if the number of special characters `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If `n` is even, it constructs a string of length `n` where each pair of characters alternates between 'A' and 'B', ensuring that each character is special. The string is constructed such that it is of length `n` and each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, meeting the problem requirements. The program also correctly handles the input format and outputs the results as specified.
