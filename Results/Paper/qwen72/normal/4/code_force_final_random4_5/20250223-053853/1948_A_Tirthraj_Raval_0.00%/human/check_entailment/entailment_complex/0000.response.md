Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the integer `n` representing the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters (since special characters must come in pairs to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one of their neighbors). In such cases, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: If `n` is even, the function constructs a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. This is done by appending 'A' and 'B' in pairs to the `pattern` list. This approach ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, thus making all `n` characters special.

4. **Output Format**: The function correctly prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string for each test case where `n` is even. The length of the string is exactly `n`, which is within the allowed limit of 200 characters.

5. **Example Validation**:
   - For `n = 6`, the function constructs the string 'ABABAB' which has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6).
   - For `n = 1`, the function correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly 1 special character.
   - For `n = 2`, the function constructs the string 'AB' which has 2 special characters (positions 1 and 2).

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and produce the correct output format.

Correctness: **True**
