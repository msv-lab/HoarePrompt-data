The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop will execute. Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this means `t` is already guaranteed to be non-zero and within the specified range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves (r_i, c_i) is a valid move on an n × n chessboard, meaning 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and no two rooks share the same row or column. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
