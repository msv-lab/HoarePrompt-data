Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) but still significant enough to isolate more than one island. For example, consider the test case \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \). According to the problem description, Dominater can destroy up to 3 bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can visit. The optimal strategy would be to isolate one island by destroying 3 bridges, leaving Everule with only 2 islands to visit (including island 1). However, the program will output \( n - 1 = 4 \), which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2.

Here is the test case that fails:

5 3

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
4
