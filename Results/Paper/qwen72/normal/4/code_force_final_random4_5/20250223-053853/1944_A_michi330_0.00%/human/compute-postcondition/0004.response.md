Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n - 1`. The function does not return any value, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not retained after the function execution. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each case. **
