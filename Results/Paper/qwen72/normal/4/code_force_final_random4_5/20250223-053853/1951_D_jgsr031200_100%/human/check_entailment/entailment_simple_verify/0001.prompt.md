You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check (n == k):**
   - If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, then the solution is straightforward. Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels and be left with 0 coins.
   - This part of the code is correct.

2. **Insufficient Coins (n < k):**
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels.
   - This part of the code is also correct.

3. **Setting Up Stalls:**
   - The code attempts to set up two stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The first stall's price is set to `n - k + 1`, which ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from this stall. This is because the price is set such that Alice can only afford one jewel (since `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1`).
   - The second stall's price is set to 1, which ensures that Alice can buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels from this stall.
   - The code then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls and checks if it equals `k`.

4. **Calculation of `h`:**
   - The variable `h` is used to keep track of the total number of jewels Alice can buy.
   - The code calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updates `h` accordingly.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES" and the prices of the two stalls.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct. If the solution is possible, it prints "YES", the number of stalls (2), and the prices of the stalls.
   - If the solution is not possible, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
The provided program is **not** correct. Here’s why:

- **Incorrect Stalls Setup:**
  - The program always sets up exactly two stalls, which is not always necessary. For example, if `n` is much larger than `k`, Bob can set up more than two stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - The logic for setting up the stalls and calculating the number of jewels Alice can buy is flawed. The prices `n - k + 1` and `1` are not always the optimal or correct prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `k` is 1 and `n` is any value, the program should always print "YES" and set up a single stall with a price of `n` coins. However, the current logic does not account for this.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve setting up the minimum number of stalls required to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here’s a revised version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            print(n)
        else:
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Initial Check (n < k):**
  - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
- **Single Stall (k == 1):**
  - If `k` is 1, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of `n` coins. Alice will buy exactly one jewel.
- **Two Stalls (k > 1):**
  - If `k` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls:
    - The first stall's price is `n - k + 1`, ensuring Alice buys one jewel.
    - The second stall's price is 1, ensuring Alice buys the remaining `k - 1` jewels.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
