Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine if Bob can set up the store in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The function `func_1` is responsible for this task. Let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - If `n == k`, the function prints 'YES', followed by `1` and `1`. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `1` coin each.
   - If `n < k`, the function prints 'NO' and returns. This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over `costs` and calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall, reducing `n` accordingly.
   - The variable `h` is used to keep track of the total number of jewels Alice buys.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if `h` (the total number of jewels Alice buys) is less than `k`.
   - If `h < k`, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `h >= k`, it prints 'YES', followed by `2` and the elements of `costs`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `costs`:**
  - The `costs` list is initialized with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is intended to ensure that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels, but it doesn't always work as intended.
  - For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, `costs` will be `[5, 1]`. The function will then calculate:
    - `curr = 7 // 5 = 1` (Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall, `n` becomes `2`).
    - `curr = 2 // 1 = 2` (Alice buys 2 jewels from the second stall, `n` becomes `0`).
    - `h` will be `1 + 2 = 3`, which is correct, but the output `5 1` is not a valid solution because Alice cannot buy exactly 3 jewels with 7 coins if the prices are 5 and 1.

- **Incorrect Handling of `n` and `k`:**
  - The function reduces `n` to 0, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
  - The function should ensure that the total number of jewels Alice buys is exactly `k`, not just that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that the prices are set in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One simple and effective way to do this is to set the prices of the first `k` stalls to `1` coin each, and the remaining stalls to a price that Alice cannot afford. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(k)
    print(' '.join(['1'] * k))
```

This version correctly handles the problem by ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when `n >= k`.

Given the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**

The original program does not always produce the correct output for all valid inputs, as demonstrated by the example where `n = 7` and `k = 3`. The output `5 1` is not a valid solution.
