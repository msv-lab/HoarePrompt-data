Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Setting Up Stalls:**
   - The program attempts to set up stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program only considers two stalls, which is not sufficient to handle all cases where `k` can be up to 60.

2. **Handling of `n` and `k`:**
   - The program checks if `n == k` and prints `YES` with a single stall price of 1. This is correct for the specific case where Alice has exactly `k` coins and each jewel costs 1 coin.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle cases where `n` is greater than `k` and `k` is greater than 1. The logic for distributing the remaining coins and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is incorrect.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of stalls as 2, which is not always correct. The number of stalls should be determined based on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem, Bob can set up stalls with prices in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One effective approach is to use a binary representation of `k` to determine the stall prices. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels by distributing the prices in a way that matches the binary representation of `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        # Determine the number of stalls needed
        stalls = []
        remaining_coins = n
        for i in range(60):
            if k & (1 << i):
                price = 1 << i
                if price <= remaining_coins:
                    stalls.append(price)
                    remaining_coins -= price
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break
        else:
            print(len(stalls))
            print(*stalls)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - If `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels, so the program prints `NO`.

3. **Stall Setup:**
   - The program uses a loop to determine the stall prices based on the binary representation of `k`.
   - For each bit position `i` (from 0 to 59), if the `i`-th bit of `k` is set, the program adds a stall with a price of `2^i` (i.e., `1 << i`).
   - The program ensures that the total cost of the jewels does not exceed `n` by subtracting the price from `remaining_coins`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the loop completes without breaking, the program prints `YES`, the number of stalls, and the stall prices.
   - If the loop breaks (i.e., the total cost exceeds `n`), the program prints `NO`.

This approach ensures that Bob can set up the stalls correctly and Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
