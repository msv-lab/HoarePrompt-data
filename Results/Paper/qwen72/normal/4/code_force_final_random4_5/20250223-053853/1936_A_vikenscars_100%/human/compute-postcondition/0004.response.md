The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item in the range [0, n-1] as determined by the comparison function `func_1`, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
