Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is responsible for making a query to the interactor and receiving the result.
   - It correctly formats the query and prints it, ensuring the output is flushed.
   - It then reads the response from the interactor and returns it.
   - The function is used to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i \oplus p_j` is maximized.
   - The first loop in `func_2` is intended to find the index of the maximum element in the permutation. It does this by comparing each element with the current maximum using the bitwise OR operation. If `p_i \mid p_i` (which is just `p_i`) is greater than `p_max_item_idx \mid p_max_item_idx` (which is `p_max_item_idx`), then `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - The second loop in `func_2` is intended to find the second index `pair_idx` that, when XORed with `max_item_idx`, gives the maximum possible value. It does this by comparing `p_max_item_idx \mid p_pair_idx` with `p_max_item_idx \mid p_i`. If `p_i` is greater, `pair_idx` is updated to `i`. If they are equal, it further checks `p_pair_idx \mid p_pair_idx` with `p_i \mid p_i` to ensure the correct `pair_idx` is chosen.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the required format.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach in `func_2` is not entirely correct. The first loop finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation, but the second loop does not guarantee that the XOR of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` is maximized.
   - The XOR operation is not directly related to the bitwise OR operation used in the queries. The maximum XOR value might not involve the maximum element in the permutation.
   - The second loop should be designed to find the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR, not just the pair that maximizes the bitwise OR.

4. **Number of Queries**:
   - The function `func_2` uses `2n - 2` queries in the worst case (one for each element in the first loop and one for each element in the second loop, excluding the initial values).
   - This is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The approach to finding the maximum XOR pair is flawed because it relies on the maximum element and bitwise OR comparisons, which do not necessarily lead to the maximum XOR value.

Correctness: **False**
