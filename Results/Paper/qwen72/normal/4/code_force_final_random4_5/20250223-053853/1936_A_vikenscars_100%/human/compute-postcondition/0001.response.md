The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` starts at 1 and will iterate up to `n-1`. The other variables (`max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is 0, `pair_idx` is an integer in the range [0, n-1]**
