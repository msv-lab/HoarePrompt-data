The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each of which must be between 0 and n-1, where n is the length of the permutation p. It prints a query string formatted as '? a b c d' to the console and then returns the user's input as a string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input values `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the function returns a string that represents the user's response to the printed query.
