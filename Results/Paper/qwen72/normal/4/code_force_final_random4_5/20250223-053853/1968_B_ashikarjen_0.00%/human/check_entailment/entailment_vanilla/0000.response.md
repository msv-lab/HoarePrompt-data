### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.

3. **Loop through `a`:**
   - The function iterates over each character in string `a` using the index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a nested while loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from position `j`.

4. **Subsequence Check:**
   - If `b[j]` matches `a[i]`, it increments `k` by 1 and moves `j` to the next position in `b` to continue the search for the next character in `a`.
   - If `j` reaches the end of `b` without finding a match for `a[i]`, the loop breaks, as it means the current prefix of `a` cannot be extended further as a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the problem by iterating through `a` and checking if each character can be found in `b` in the correct order.
- The use of the nested while loop ensures that the function finds the next matching character in `b` efficiently.
- The function breaks out of the loop as soon as it cannot find a match, which is the correct behavior for determining the maximum prefix length that is a subsequence.
- The function does not handle multiple test cases, but the problem description indicates that the function should be called for each test case, which is a common pattern in competitive programming.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct for the given problem description. It correctly determines the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.

### Correctness:
**True**
