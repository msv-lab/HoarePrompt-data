Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input for multiple test cases. According to the problem description, the first line of input should contain the number of test cases `t`, and the program should process each test case accordingly. However, the provided program only processes a single test case and does not handle the loop for multiple test cases. This means that for any input with more than one test case, the program will not work correctly.

To fix this, the program should include a loop to handle multiple test cases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        k = 0
        j = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
                j += 1
            if j < m:
                k += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                break
        print(k)
```

This version of the program will correctly handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
