### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If both are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and thus Bob cannot form a different rectangle. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
   - The second condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`). If this is true, the resulting rectangles will be of the same size as the original or a 90-degree rotation of the original, which means Bob cannot form a different rectangle. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where both dimensions are 1 (e.g., `1 1`), which is an odd-odd case and thus prints 'NO'.
   - The program also correctly handles cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other (e.g., `2 1`), which prints 'NO'.
   - The program correctly handles cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd (e.g., `2 6`), which prints 'YES'.
   - The program correctly handles cases where both dimensions are even (e.g., `2 2`), which prints 'YES'.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, which matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given dimensions. It handles all the edge cases and conditions as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
