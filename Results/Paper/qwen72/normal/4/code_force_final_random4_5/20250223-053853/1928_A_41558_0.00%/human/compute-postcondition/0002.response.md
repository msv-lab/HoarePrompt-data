Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, reading pairs of integers `a` and `b` from the input. For each pair, it will check if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly half of the other. If either condition is true, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES'. The values of `a` and `b` will be updated with each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be the last pair read from the input. The value of `n` will remain unchanged.**
