Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input where the scores are `3 3 3`. According to the problem description, the output should be `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with any combination of wins, losses, and draws. However, the program incorrectly outputs `3` for this case. This indicates that the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly identify all invalid score combinations.
