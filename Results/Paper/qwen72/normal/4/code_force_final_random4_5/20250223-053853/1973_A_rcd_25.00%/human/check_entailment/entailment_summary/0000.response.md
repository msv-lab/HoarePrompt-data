Reasoning:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total points in a set of chess games must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

2. **High Score Check**: If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `(p1 + p2)`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because in this case, the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2`, and the remaining points can be distributed as wins/losses. For example, if `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 1`, the only way to achieve this is with one draw and one loss for the third player.

3. **Balancing Scores**: If the above conditions are not met, the program enters a loop to find a balanced number of draws. It calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores. It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that the remaining points can be balanced. If it finds such a value, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`. If it doesn't find a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the input `(0, 0, 0)`, the sum is 0 (even), and the highest score is not greater than the sum of the other two scores, so the program correctly prints `0`.
   - For the input `(0, 1, 1)`, the sum is 2 (even), and the highest score is equal to the sum of the other two scores, so the program correctly prints `1`.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 1)`, the sum is 3 (odd), so the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 2)`, the sum is 4 (even), and the highest score is not greater than the sum of the other two scores, so the program correctly prints `2`.
   - For the input `(3, 3, 3)`, the sum is 9 (odd), so the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `(3, 4, 5)`, the sum is 12 (even), and the highest score is not greater than the sum of the other two scores, so the program correctly prints `6`.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 10)`, the sum is 12 (even), and the highest score is greater than the sum of the other two scores, so the program correctly prints `2`.

5. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program correctly handles the sum of scores being odd.
   - It correctly handles the case where the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores.
   - The loop to balance the scores is a bit complex but seems to handle the cases where the scores are not trivially balanced.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly handle all the test cases provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
