### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - This check is correct because the sum of points in any valid set of games must be even.

3. **Handling the Case Where the Highest Score is Greater Than or Equal to the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws that can occur is when the two players with the lowest scores play against each other and all their games end in draws.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the remaining points can be distributed in a way that all games between `p1` and `p2` are draws.

4. **Handling the Case Where the Highest Score is Less Than the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores (`p1` and `p2`).
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to check if the current number of draws is valid.
   - If a valid number of draws is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no valid number of draws is found, it prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where the scores are not consistent (e.g., `1 1 10`) correctly by printing `-1`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The program correctly identifies that the total score must be even.
- It correctly handles the case where the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores.
- The iterative approach to find the maximum number of draws when `p3 < p1 + p2` is logically sound, but it can be simplified. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game.

### Simplification:
- The iterative approach can be simplified to a direct calculation. The maximum number of draws can be determined by the formula `min((p1 + p2 + p3) // 2, p1 + p2)`.
- However, the given program's logic is correct and will produce the right results for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
