### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases Loop**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity**:
   - The program first checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, either 2 for a win or 1 for each player in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.

3. **Checking for Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. This condition ensures that the highest score can be achieved by wins and draws.
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum number of draws is when the highest score is the sum of the other two scores, and all games are draws.

4. **Handling Complex Cases**:
   - If the above condition is not met, the program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores (`p1` and `p2`).
   - It then uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws. The variable `cur` is initialized to `low`, and the loop continues while `high >= cur`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current configuration of draws is valid by ensuring that the remaining points for `p1` and `p2` after subtracting `cur` and `p3 - cur` respectively, satisfy the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, it prints `p3`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where the total sum of scores is odd, which is invalid.
- The program correctly handles the case where the highest score is the sum of the other two scores, which means all games were draws.
- The binary search-like approach in the else block is intended to find the maximum number of draws, but it seems overly complex and may not always produce the correct result.

### Simplified Approach:
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated more straightforwardly. If the sum of the scores is even, the maximum number of draws is the sum of the minimum scores of the two players with the lowest scores, as long as the highest score is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is mostly correct, but the binary search-like approach in the else block is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
- The program is not entirely correct due to the overly complex and potentially incorrect logic in the else block.

### Correctness: **False**
