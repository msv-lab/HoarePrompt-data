You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input. The loop will print a value based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be updated for each iteration, but the initial input values `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (which are not used inside the loop) will remain unchanged. After `t` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will end.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It then prints a value based on the following conditions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it calculates a value that balances the scores and prints it. After processing all `t` test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - This check is correct because the sum of points in any valid set of games must be even.

3. **Handling the Case Where the Highest Score is Greater Than or Equal to the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws that can occur is when the two players with the lowest scores play against each other and all their games end in draws.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the remaining points can be distributed in a way that all games between `p1` and `p2` are draws.

4. **Handling the Case Where the Highest Score is Less Than the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores (`p1` and `p2`).
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to check if the current number of draws is valid.
   - If a valid number of draws is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no valid number of draws is found, it prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where the scores are not consistent (e.g., `1 1 10`) correctly by printing `-1`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The program correctly identifies that the total score must be even.
- It correctly handles the case where the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores.
- The iterative approach to find the maximum number of draws when `p3 < p1 + p2` is logically sound, but it can be simplified. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game.

### Simplification:
- The iterative approach can be simplified to a direct calculation. The maximum number of draws can be determined by the formula `min((p1 + p2 + p3) // 2, p1 + p2)`.
- However, the given program's logic is correct and will produce the right results for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
