Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same. However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The problem requires ensuring that no operation can be applied to the array to make all elements the same, which is a more complex condition than just finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**:
   - The program processes each test case correctly in terms of input, but the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as arrays of length 1 or arrays where all elements are the same.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to:
1. Identify if the array is already non-beautiful (e.g., if it has only one element or if all elements are different).
2. If the array is beautiful, find the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful. This involves checking if there are any elements that can be removed to break the condition where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for some `i`.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def min_elements_to_remove():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If the array has only one element, it is already non-beautiful
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # If all elements are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Count the number of elements that can be removed to break the beautiful condition
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                count += 1
        
        # If no elements can be removed to break the condition, it is impossible
        if count == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(1)

min_elements_to_remove()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, it is already non-beautiful, so the output is -1.
- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, so the output is -1.
- **Counting Elements to Remove**: For arrays with more than one element, the program counts the number of elements that can be removed to break the condition where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. If such elements exist, the minimum number of elements to remove is 1. If no such elements exist, the output is -1.
