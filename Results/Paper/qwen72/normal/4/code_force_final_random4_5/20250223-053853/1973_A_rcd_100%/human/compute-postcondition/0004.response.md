Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then prints a result for each test case: -1 if the sum of the scores is odd, `p1 + p2` if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, or a calculated value based on the scores if neither of the above conditions are met. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes the last values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` used in the last iteration of the loop. **
