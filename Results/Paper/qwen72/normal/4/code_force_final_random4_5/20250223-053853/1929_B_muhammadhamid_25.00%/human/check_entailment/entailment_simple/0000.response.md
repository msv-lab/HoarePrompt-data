### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The output for each test case is a single integer representing the minimum number of cells to color.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell to satisfy the condition. This is handled correctly by the program.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal). This is also handled correctly by the program.

4. **General Case:**
   - If \( k > 2n \), the program uses the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because:
     - For \( k \leq 2n \), the formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) works.
     - For \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more than \( 2n \) diagonals. The program correctly calculates the number of cells needed by dividing \( k \) by 2 and adding 1. This is because each additional cell can cover at most 2 new diagonals, and we need to ensure that all \( k \) diagonals are covered.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 2n \) correctly.
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k \) is greater than \( 2n \).

6. **Mathematical Verification:**
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) is correct because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.
   - For \( k > 2n \), the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) is correct because:
     - \( k // 2 \) cells can cover \( 2 \times (k // 2) \) diagonals.
     - The remaining \( k \% 2 \) (which is 1 if \( k \) is odd) requires an additional cell.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given cases and edge conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
