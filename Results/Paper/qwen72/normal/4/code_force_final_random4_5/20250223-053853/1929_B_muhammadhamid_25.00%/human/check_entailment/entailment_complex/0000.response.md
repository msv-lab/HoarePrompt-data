Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each one. This matches the problem description.

2. **Edge Case for k == 1**: The function correctly handles the case where `k` is 1 by printing 1. This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to be colored, one cell is sufficient.

3. **Case for k <= 2 * n**: The function prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because:
   - Each cell in the grid can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   - To cover `k` diagonals, the minimum number of cells required is `k / 2` if `k` is even, or `(k + 1) / 2` if `k` is odd. This is equivalent to `math.ceil(k / 2)`.

4. **Case for k > 2 * n**: The function prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is correct because:
   - If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, it means we need to cover more than the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by the cells on the main and anti-diagonals.
   - The remaining diagonals can be covered by placing cells in the interior of the grid. The formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that the minimum number of cells is used to cover the required diagonals.

5. **Output**: The function correctly prints the result for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not retained after the loop, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the function prints `2`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the function prints `2`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the function prints `6`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 9`, the function prints `5`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 7`, the function prints `4`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 11`, the function prints `6`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function prints `2`, which is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for all given test cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
