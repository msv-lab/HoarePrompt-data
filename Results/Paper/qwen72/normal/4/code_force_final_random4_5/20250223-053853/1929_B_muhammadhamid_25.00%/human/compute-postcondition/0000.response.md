The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop's execution is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations the loop should perform. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
