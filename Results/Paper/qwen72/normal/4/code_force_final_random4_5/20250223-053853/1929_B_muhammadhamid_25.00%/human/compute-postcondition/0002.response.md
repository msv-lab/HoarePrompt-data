The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with parameters `t`, `n`, and `k` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2. The function should return a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and for each test case, integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). It returns a result based on these parameters.**
