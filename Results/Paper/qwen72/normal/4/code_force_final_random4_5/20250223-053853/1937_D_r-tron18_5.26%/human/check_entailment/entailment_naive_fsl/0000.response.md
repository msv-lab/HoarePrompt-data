Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball according to the rules specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not simulate the pinball's movement step by step, which is necessary to accurately determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
>><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 4 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program's output for this input is incorrect. The program does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters in the grid.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should simulate the pinball's movement for each cell, taking into account the inversion of the characters after each move. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.
