### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a 1D grid of length `n` where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - We need to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that calculates the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific position.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time for each starting position.

3. **Breaking Down `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `suffZero` is a list used to keep track of the cumulative sum of indices where the character is '<'.
     - `ans` is the list to store the results for each starting position.

   - **Loop through the grid from right to left:**
     - For each cell `i`:
       - If the cell contains '>', it means the pinball will move right.
       - The program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by considering the cumulative sums of '>' and '<' indices.
       - The program updates the cumulative sums and the result list accordingly.
       - If the cell contains '<', it means the pinball will move left.
       - The program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by considering the cumulative sums of '<' and '>' indices.
       - The program updates the cumulative sums and the result list accordingly.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is based on the cumulative sums of indices where the characters are '>' and '<'.
   - The program correctly handles the inversion of the characters after the pinball moves.
   - The program correctly updates the cumulative sums and the result list for each starting position.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where the grid is entirely '<' or entirely '>'.
   - The program should handle cases where the grid is a mix of '<' and '>'.
   - The program should handle the boundary conditions where the pinball leaves the grid from the left or right border.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses cumulative sums to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times, which is efficient.
   - The overall complexity is O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of cumulative sums and the handling of character inversions are appropriate and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
