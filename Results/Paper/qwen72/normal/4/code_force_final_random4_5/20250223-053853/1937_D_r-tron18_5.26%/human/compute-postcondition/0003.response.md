Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where the character in `s1` is '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of the indices in `pre` starting with 0, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new list `suffZero` which is initialized to contain a single element, 0.
