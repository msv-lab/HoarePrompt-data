### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.

2. **Bitmasking for Subsequence Check:**
   - The program uses a bitmask `cur` to track the presence of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets in the current subsequence.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character.
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` alphabets are present in the current subsequence, and the program increments the count `cnt` and resets `cur`.

3. **Count Check:**
   - The program checks if the count `cnt` of complete subsequences is at least `n`.
   - If `cnt >= n`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `cnt < n`, it prints 'NO' and then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

4. **String Construction for 'NO' Case:**
   - The program constructs a string `ans` that represents the incomplete set and the remaining characters needed to complete `n` sets.
   - It initializes `ans` with `cnt` occurrences of the last character in the first `k` alphabets.
   - It then finds the first character that is missing from the current bitmask `cur` and adds it to `ans`.
   - Finally, it appends `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`.

5. **Issues:**
   - The program incorrectly constructs the string `ans` in the 'NO' case. The logic for constructing `ans` is flawed.
   - The program should generate a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`. However, the current logic does not ensure this.
   - The program should generate a string that is not a subsequence of `s`, but the current approach might not always produce such a string.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program's logic for constructing the string `ans` in the 'NO' case is incorrect. Specifically, the way it constructs `ans` does not guarantee that the resulting string is not a subsequence of `s`. The program should generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`, but the current approach might produce a string that is still a subsequence.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly handle the 'NO' case, the program should generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`. One way to do this is to generate a string that is the lexicographically smallest string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
        possible_strings = set()
        for i in range(k ** n):
            tmp = ''
            for j in range(n):
                tmp += chr(ord('a') + (i // (k ** j)) % k)
            possible_strings.add(tmp)
        
        # Check if all possible strings are subsequences of s
        for possible_string in possible_strings:
            j = 0
            for char in s:
                if j < n and possible_string[j] == char:
                    j += 1
            if j < n:
                print('NO')
                print(possible_string)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and checks if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints 'NO' followed by that string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints 'YES'.
