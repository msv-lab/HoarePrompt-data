You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from input, and a string `s` of length `m`. After processing the string `s`, it either prints 'YES' if the count of complete sets of the first `k` alphabets is at least `n`, or prints 'NO' followed by a string that represents the incomplete set and the remaining characters needed to complete `n` sets. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are reset for each iteration, and the loop does not modify any variables outside its scope.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` containing only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then processes the string `s` to determine if it contains at least `n` complete sets of the first `k` alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that represents the incomplete set and the remaining characters needed to complete `n` sets. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide one such string that is not a subsequence.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the string `s`.

3. **Subsequence Checking:**
   - The program uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters in `s`.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which is used to keep track of the characters seen in the current subsequence.
   - For each character `ss` in `s`, it calculates `cur_ss` as the index of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
   - It checks if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur` using `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`.
   - If the bit is not set, it sets the bit using `cur += 1 << cur_ss`.
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence, so it increments `cnt` and resets `cur` to 0.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it means there are at least `n` subsequences of length `k` in `s`, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that is not a subsequence of `s`:
     - It initializes `ans` with `cnt` occurrences of the last character in the first `k` alphabets.
     - It then finds the first character in the first `k` alphabets that is not present in the current subsequence and appends it to `ans`.
     - Finally, it appends `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The logic for constructing the string that is not a subsequence is flawed.
   - The program constructs `ans` by adding `cnt` occurrences of the last character, which is incorrect because `cnt` represents the number of complete subsequences of length `k`, not the length of the string to be constructed.
   - The program should construct a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence, but the current logic does not ensure this.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` does not contain all `k` characters, leading to incorrect construction of the non-subsequence string.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program's logic for constructing the string that is not a subsequence is incorrect. It should construct a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`, but the current logic does not ensure this. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` does not contain all `k` characters, which can lead to incorrect results.
