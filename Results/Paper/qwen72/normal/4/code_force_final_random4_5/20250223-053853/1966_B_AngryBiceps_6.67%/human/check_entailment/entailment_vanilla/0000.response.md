### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations.
   - An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in a list \( a \).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If the first and last rows are not the same and the first row is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first row cannot influence the last row if they are different.
   - Similarly, if the first and last columns are not the same and the first column is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first column cannot influence the last column if they are different.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
     - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
     - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.
   - It checks if the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row. If so, it prints "NO".
   - It checks if the first column (constructed from the first characters of each row) is entirely one color and different from the last column (constructed from the last characters of each row). If so, it prints "NO".
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the grid is \( 1 \times 1 \) correctly by printing "YES" if the single square is the same color.
   - It also handles cases where the grid is already the same color by printing "YES".

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of the program is sound. It correctly identifies situations where the grid cannot be made uniform due to the constraints of the operations.
   - The conditions it checks are sufficient to determine if the grid can be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
