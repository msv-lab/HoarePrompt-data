The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer represents a vertex number from 1 to n, and the list can contain duplicates. It returns a dictionary `d` where the keys are the unique integers from the list `l`, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears in `l`. The function does not modify the input list `l`. After the function concludes, the dictionary `d` contains the frequency of each unique integer in `l`.
