The only variables in the loop head are `p` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `p <= num`. Right before the loop, `p` is 2, and `num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2. Given this, the condition `p <= num` is already satisfied, so no adjustments are needed.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2; `prime` is a list of `num` + 1 elements, where `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num` + 1 elements, all of which are 0; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num` + 1 elements, all of which are 0; `p` is 2**
