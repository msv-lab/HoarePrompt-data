#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element of the input string, split by spaces, into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, and returns an iterator that converts each split element into an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has an iterator of integers derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the space-separated list of integers provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input and returns a list of integers. It does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers that were provided as input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, v is a value of any type.
def func_3(n, v):
    return [v for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing `n` elements, where each element is the value of `v`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a value `v` of any type. It returns a list containing `n` elements, where each element is the value `v`. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers, and v is a value of any type.
def func_4(n, m, v):
    return [[v for i in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains `m` copies of the value `v`, and there are `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`, where `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, and `v` is a value of any type. It returns a list of `n` inner lists, each containing `m` copies of the value `v`. After the function concludes, the program state includes a new list of lists, with the specified dimensions and values, and no changes are made to the input parameters.

    return l
    #The program returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` lists. Each list at index `i` (where 0 <= i <= n) may contain integers that were appended during the loop execution, and each integer `x` appended to `l[i]` will also have `i` appended to `l[x]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n. It returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` lists. Each list at index `i` (where 0 <= i <= n) may contain integers that were appended during the loop execution, and each integer `x` appended to `l[i]` will also have `i` appended to `l[x]`. The function essentially creates a symmetric adjacency list representation of a graph with `n + 1` nodes, where `m` edges are added between nodes based on the values returned by `func_1`.

    #The program returns the adjacency matrix `l` which is a square matrix of size (n+1) x (n+1). In this matrix, `m` pairs of indices (x, y) have been set to 1, indicating that the corresponding edges (diagonals) have been marked. All other elements in the matrix remain 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, representing the number of edges (diagonals) to be marked. It returns an adjacency matrix `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1), where `m` pairs of indices (x, y) are set to 1 to indicate marked edges, and all other elements are 0. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer represents a vertex number from 1 to n, and the list can contain duplicates. It returns a dictionary `d` where the keys are the unique integers from the list `l`, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears in `l`. The function does not modify the input list `l`. After the function concludes, the dictionary `d` contains the frequency of each unique integer in `l`.
