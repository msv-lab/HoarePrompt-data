The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` function. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts does not provide any information about the input value, so we need to ensure that the input value is at least 1.

State: **`_` is in the range of 1 to `t` (inclusive), `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s` and `f` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5**
