The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` vertices chosen by Bessie, where `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` additional vertices that can be chosen, where `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The vertices chosen by Bessie are represented by a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
