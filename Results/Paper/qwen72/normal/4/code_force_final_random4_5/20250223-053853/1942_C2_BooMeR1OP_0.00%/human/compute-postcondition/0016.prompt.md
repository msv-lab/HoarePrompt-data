You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `a` is the same sorted list of integers, `n` is the same integer, `x` is the same integer, `y` is the same integer, `present` is the same set of unique elements from `a`, and `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is true.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: `a` is the same sorted list of integers, `n` is the same integer, `x` is the same integer, `y` is the same integer, `present` is the same set of unique elements from `a`, `ans` is the same as in the initial state, `gaps` is a list of positive gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (with the last element considering the addition of `n`).
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains the same sorted list of integers, `n` remains the same integer, `x` remains the same integer, `y` will be 0 if the loop completes without breaking or a non-negative integer if the loop breaks, `present` remains the same set of unique elements from `a`, `ans` will be the sum of all `gap` values added to it during the loop or the sum of `2 * y` if the loop breaks.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of all gap values added to it during the loop if the loop completes without breaking, or 2 * y if the loop breaks, and y is a non-negative integer if the loop breaks or 0 if the loop completes without breaking)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `chosen_vertices`. It returns a list of integers representing the vertices you can choose, ensuring that the total number of chosen vertices, including Bessie's choices, does not exceed `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
