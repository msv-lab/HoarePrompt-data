The only objects in the loop head are the variable `gap` and the list `gaps`. For the loop to execute, `gaps` must contain at least one element. The state of `gap` is not something we need to specify before the loop starts, as it will be assigned the first element of `gaps` when the loop begins.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `gaps` is a non-empty list.

State: **`a` is the same sorted list of integers, `n` is the same integer, `x` is the same integer, `y` is the same integer, `present` is the same set of unique elements from `a`, `ans` is the same as in the initial state, `gaps` is a sorted list of positive gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (with the last element considering the addition of `n`) that must have at least one element**
