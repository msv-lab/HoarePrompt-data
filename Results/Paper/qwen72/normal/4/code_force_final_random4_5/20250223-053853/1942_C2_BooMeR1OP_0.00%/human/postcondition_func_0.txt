The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie and calculates the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen under the given constraints. The function prints the final count of chosen vertices, which includes Bessie's choices and the additional vertices chosen based on the gaps between Bessie's chosen vertices and the maximum number of additional vertices allowed. The function does not return any value.
