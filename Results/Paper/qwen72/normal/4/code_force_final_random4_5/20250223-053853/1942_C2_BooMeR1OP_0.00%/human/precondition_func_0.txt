The function `func_1` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
