This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `a` is the same sorted list of integers, `n` is the same integer, `x` is the same integer, `y` is the same integer, `present` is the same set of unique elements from `a`, and `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is true.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: `a` is the same sorted list of integers, `n` is the same integer, `x` is the same integer, `y` is the same integer, `present` is the same set of unique elements from `a`, `ans` is the same as in the initial state, `gaps` is a list of positive gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (with the last element considering the addition of `n`).
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains the same sorted list of integers, `n` remains the same integer, `x` remains the same integer, `y` will be 0 if the loop completes without breaking or a non-negative integer if the loop breaks, `present` remains the same set of unique elements from `a`, `ans` will be the sum of all `gap` values added to it during the loop or the sum of `2 * y` if the loop breaks.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of all gap values added to it during the loop if the loop completes without breaking, or 2 * y if the loop breaks, and y is a non-negative integer if the loop breaks or 0 if the loop completes without breaking)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie and calculates the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen under the given constraints. The function prints the final count of chosen vertices, which includes Bessie's choices and the additional vertices chosen based on the gaps between Bessie's chosen vertices and the maximum number of additional vertices allowed. The function does not return any value.
