You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The values of t, n, and m remain unchanged. The loop iterates a times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers b and c from the input. Depending on the values of b and c, it prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The variable a is not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `a` test cases, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `m` mentioned in the preconditions, and it does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. This condition is incorrect because it checks if the parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is the same as the parity of `b` (the number of moves), which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == m % 2` to check if the parity of the number of moves `b` is the same as the parity of the desired number of cubes `m`.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 5` and `m = 3`:
- The program should output "Yes" because it is possible to achieve a tower of 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., put 1 cube, put 1 cube, put 1 cube, remove 1 cube, put 1 cube).
- However, the program outputs "No" because it incorrectly checks the parity of `a` (which is 1 in this case) instead of `b` and `m`.

This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is **False**.
