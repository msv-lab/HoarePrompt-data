### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - If `b` is equal to `c`, the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves.
   - If `a % 2 == b % 2`, the function prints 'Yes'. This condition checks if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, this condition is incorrect. The parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking if `b` and `c` have the same parity.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints 'No'. This is correct for the cases where `b` and `c` do not have the same parity.

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition to check if it is possible to have exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves is whether `b` and `c` have the same parity. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and the parity of the number of cubes will only match the parity of the number of moves if the difference between the initial and final number of cubes is even.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong condition to check the parity. The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
