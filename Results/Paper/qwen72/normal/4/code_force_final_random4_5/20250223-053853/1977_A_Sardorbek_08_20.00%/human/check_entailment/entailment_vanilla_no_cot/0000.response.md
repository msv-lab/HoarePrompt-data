Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the condition that checks if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of moves `n`. Instead, the correct condition should check if `n % 2 == m % 2`.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == m:
            print('YES')
        elif n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n % 2 == m % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version will properly determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity of `n` and `m`.
