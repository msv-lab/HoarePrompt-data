The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `a` test cases, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `m` mentioned in the preconditions, and it does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.
