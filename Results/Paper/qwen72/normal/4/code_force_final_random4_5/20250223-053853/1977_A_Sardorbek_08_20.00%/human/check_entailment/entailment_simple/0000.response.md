### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` which represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`. If so, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - The second condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`. If so, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The third condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` checks if the parity (odd or even) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. This is incorrect because the parity of `a` (the number of test cases) should not influence the result for each individual test case. Instead, the correct condition should be `if b % 2 == c % 2:` to check if the parities of `b` and `c` are the same.
   - The final `else` block prints 'No' if none of the above conditions are met.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - For Nikita to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves, the difference between `b` and `c` must be even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves (additions and removals) will result in an even change in the number of cubes.
   - Therefore, the correct condition should be `if b % 2 == c % 2:` to check if the parities of `b` and `c` are the same. If they are, it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes; otherwise, it's not.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program is incorrect because it uses the wrong condition to check the parity of `b` and `c`.

**Correctness: False**
