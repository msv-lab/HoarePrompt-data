The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` with specific constraints. The function should return a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Since the function signature does not include parameters, we can infer that the function might be designed to read these parameters from an external source (e.g., user input, file, or another function) or they might be passed in a different way (e.g., through a global variable or a list of test cases).

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.

The function should process each test case and return a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). It returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints.**
