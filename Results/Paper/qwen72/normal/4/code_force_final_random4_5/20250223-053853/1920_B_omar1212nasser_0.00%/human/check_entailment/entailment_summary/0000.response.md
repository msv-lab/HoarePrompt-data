Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` and calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the smallest elements from the array, as removing the smallest elements will have the least impact on the sum.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Bob is to multiply the largest elements by -1, as this will reduce the sum the most.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
   - The special case `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3` returns 0. This is a hardcoded solution for a specific test case, which is not a general solution and may not be correct for all inputs.
   - The function calculates the sum of the array `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `n`.
   - It then iterates over the possible number of removals from 0 to `removals` and calculates the potential sum after removing the smallest `i` elements and negating the largest `negatives` elements.
   - The function appends each calculated sum to the list `pos` and returns the maximum value from this list.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The special case `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3` is a hardcoded solution and does not handle other cases correctly. This is a significant flaw in the function.
   - The function `func_2` should not rely on hardcoded values but should handle all possible inputs within the given constraints.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly handle all cases, especially the special case `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3` which is not a general solution.
   - The logic for calculating the optimal sum after Alice's and Bob's moves is generally correct, but the hardcoded special case makes the function incorrect for some inputs.

Given the issues with the special case in `func_2`, the program is not correct for all inputs.

Correctness: **False**
