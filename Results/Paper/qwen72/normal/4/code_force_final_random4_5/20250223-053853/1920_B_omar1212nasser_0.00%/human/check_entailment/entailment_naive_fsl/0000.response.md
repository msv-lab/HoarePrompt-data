Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of elements to be removed by Alice (k) is equal to the number of elements in the array (n). In such a case, Alice can remove all elements, and the sum should be 0. However, the current implementation does not consider this edge case correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 3
```
Expected output: `0` (Alice can remove all elements, leaving an empty array with a sum of 0).

Actual output: The program will attempt to access elements that do not exist, leading to incorrect behavior or an exception.
