Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
func_1()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= k, x <= n`, and `1 <= a_i <= 1000`. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. After the function completes, the final values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` will be those from the last test case, with `a` being sorted. The function does not return any value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    if removals == 6 and negatives == 3:
        return 0
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    return max(pos)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list `pos` containing `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is calculated as the sum of the remaining integers in `elements` after removing the last `removals` integers, minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the updated `elements` list. The function does not modify the input parameters or the `elements` list.
