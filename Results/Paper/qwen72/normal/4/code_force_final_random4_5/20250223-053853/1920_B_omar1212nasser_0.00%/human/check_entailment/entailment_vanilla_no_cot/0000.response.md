Correctness: **False**

The program provided is not correct for the given problem. Here are the reasons:

1. **Special Case Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` contains a special case handling for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which returns 0. This is not a general solution and does not handle all possible inputs correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Moves:**
   - The logic for Bob's moves is incorrect. Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. However, the current implementation tries to multiply the largest elements by -1, which is not optimal.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Alice's Moves:**
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. The current implementation does not correctly handle this. It removes elements from the end of the sorted list, which are the largest elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of elements to be removed or multiplied by -1 is equal to the number of elements in the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice removes the smallest elements to maximize the sum
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Bob multiplies the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum
    elements.sort()
    for i in range(negatives):
        if elements[i] < 0:
            elements[i] = -elements[i]
    
    # Calculate the final sum
    return sum(elements)

# Example usage
# func_1()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Alice's Moves:**
   - Alice removes the smallest `k` elements from the array to maximize the sum. This is done by slicing the array after sorting it.

2. **Bob's Moves:**
   - Bob multiplies the smallest `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum. This is done by sorting the remaining array and then iterating through the first `x` elements, changing their sign if they are negative.

3. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - After both players have made their moves, the sum of the remaining elements is calculated and returned.

This corrected version should handle all test cases correctly and optimally.
