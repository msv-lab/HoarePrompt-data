The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= k, x <= n`, and `1 <= a_i <= 1000`. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. After the function completes, the final values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` will be those from the last test case, with `a` being sorted. The function does not return any value.
