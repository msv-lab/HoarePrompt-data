You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

    n = int(input())

        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True

                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and for each test case, the loop will print either `2` or `3` based on the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. The list `l` and the integer `x` are not modified by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The best friend relationship is represented by the list `p`, where `p[i]` is the best friend of friend `i`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list `l` representing the best friend relationships.
   - It then iterates over the list `l` to check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`).

3. **Logic Check:**
   - If such a pair is found, the program prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Case 1: Pair of Best Friends**
     - If there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, sending invitations to both of them will ensure that both come to the party. This is the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to the party.
     - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` correctly checks for such pairs.
   - **Case 2: No Pair of Best Friends**
     - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`. This is because in the worst case, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 come to the party.
     - However, this is not always the correct minimum number of invitations. For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 3 (e.g., `p = [2, 3, 1]`), sending invitations to any 2 friends in the cycle will ensure that all 3 come to the party. Therefore, the minimum number of invitations needed is 2, not 3.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where there is a cycle of length 3 or more. In such cases, the program always prints `3`, which is not always the minimum number of invitations needed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for cycles in the best friend relationships, leading to an incorrect minimum number of invitations in some cases.
