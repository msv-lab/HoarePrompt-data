The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, which represents the number of test cases `t`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the number of test cases `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
