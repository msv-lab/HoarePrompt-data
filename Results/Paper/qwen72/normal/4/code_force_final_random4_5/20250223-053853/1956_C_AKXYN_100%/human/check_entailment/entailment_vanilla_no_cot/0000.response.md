Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized with permutations of integers from 1 to `n` for each row. However, this matrix is not used in the operations or the output, which is fine because the operations are described in the output directly.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum `res` of the matrix elements. The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
     \]
   - This formula is correct because it sums up the values of the matrix after performing the operations. Each row and column will contain the permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and the sum of each permutation is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). Since there are `n` rows and `n` columns, the total sum is:
     \[
     \text{res} = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n^2 \times (n+1)
     \]
   - The program correctly calculates this sum and prints it.

4. **Output Operations**:
   - The program prints the number of operations, which is `2n` (i.e., `n << 1`).
   - It then prints `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations, each using the permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - This ensures that each row and each column will be filled with the permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, which is the optimal way to maximize the sum of the matrix.

5. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations are valid and within the constraints of the problem.
   - The permutations used are correct and valid for each operation.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
