Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and Objective**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - The highest possible value for each element in the matrix is \( n \), and since there are \( n^2 \) elements, the maximum sum is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Operations to Achieve the Maximum Sum**:
   - The program uses \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - It then uses \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column with the same permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix will be set to \( n \) at least once, thus achieving the maximum sum.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the size of the matrix \( n \) for each test case.
   - **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row, which is not necessary for the final output but is a valid step.
   - **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation \( \text{res} \) is indeed incorrect. The program calculates \( \text{res} \) using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \), which does not match the problem's requirement of \( n^3 \).
   - **Output**:
     - The program outputs the sum \( \text{res} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \), which is correct in terms of the number of operations.
     - The operations themselves are valid and correctly formatted, ensuring that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for performing the operations and the number of operations is correct.
   - However, the sum calculation is incorrect, which means the program does not correctly compute the maximum sum.

Given the annotations and the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program's sum calculation is incorrect, and it does not output the correct maximum sum \( n^3 \).

Final: **False**
