Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix `mat` is initialized with each row containing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. This is not necessary for the final output but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The sum `res` is calculated using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This formula is derived from the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the matrix. For a matrix of size `n`, the maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to `n`. The formula calculates the sum of the matrix if it were filled with the maximum values, which is correct.

4. **Output Format**: The function prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is `2n`). This is correct because the problem allows up to `2n` operations to achieve the maximum sum.

5. **Operations Output**: The function prints two operations for each value of `i` from `n` to 1:
   - A Type 1 operation on row `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - A Type 2 operation on column `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

   These operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is the correct approach to maximize the sum of the matrix.

6. **Efficiency**: The solution uses exactly `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit of `2n` operations.

Given the above points, the program correctly handles the input, calculates the maximum sum, and outputs the operations in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
