Reasoning:

1. **Objective of the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve either assigning a permutation to a row or a column.

2. **Understanding the Solution**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a matrix `mat` with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum `res` using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - It prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations \( 2n \) (which is `n << 1`).
   - It then prints \( n \) operations of type 1 and \( n \) operations of type 2, each applying the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to a row and a column, respectively.

3. **Verification of the Formula**:
   - The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - For \( n = 1 \): \( (1 + 1) \times (2 \times 0 + 1) = 1 \).
     - For \( n = 2 \): \( (1 + 1) \times (2 \times 0 + 1) + (2 + 1) \times (2 \times 1 + 1) = 1 + 9 = 10 \).
     - For \( n = 3 \): \( (1 + 1) \times (2 \times 0 + 1) + (2 + 1) \times (2 \times 1 + 1) + (3 + 1) \times (2 \times 2 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 25 = 35 \).

   However, the correct maximum sum for \( n = 2 \) should be 7, and for \( n = 3 \) should be 15. The formula provided in the code is incorrect.

4. **Correct Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row and each column.
   - The sum of the elements in each row or column is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

5. **Operations**:
   - The program prints \( n \) operations of type 1 and \( n \) operations of type 2, each applying the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to a row and a column, respectively.
   - This ensures that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is the correct approach to maximize the sum.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The formula used to calculate `res` is incorrect.
   - However, the operations themselves are correct and will achieve the maximum sum.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the formula used to calculate the maximum sum `res` is wrong. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \). Despite this, the operations performed are correct and will achieve the maximum sum.
