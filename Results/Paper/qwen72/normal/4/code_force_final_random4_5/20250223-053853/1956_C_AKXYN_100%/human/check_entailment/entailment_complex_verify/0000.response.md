Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix in the most efficient way. However, let's delve deeper into the reasoning and the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either assign a permutation to a row or a column. The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \). Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This initializes the matrix `mat` with each row containing the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   The sum calculation here is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n^3 \), but the program calculates a different value using the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\), which does not correspond to the maximum sum of the matrix.

3. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(res, n << 1)
   ```
   The program prints the incorrect sum `res` and the number of operations \( 2n \) (which is \( n << 1 \)).

4. **Operations**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   The program performs \( 2n \) operations, assigning the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) to each row and each column in reverse order. This does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum of the matrix, we should assign the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) to each row and each column. This ensures that each element in the matrix is the largest possible value, \( n \), and the sum is \( n^3 \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n
        operations = 2 * n
        print(max_sum, operations)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(n, 0, -1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Explanation:
- **Sum Calculation**: The correct sum is \( n^3 \), which is calculated as `max_sum = n * n * n`.
- **Number of Operations**: The number of operations is \( 2n \), which is correctly calculated as `operations = 2 * n`.
- **Operations**: For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), the program prints two lines: one for the row operation and one for the column operation, both using the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix and uses more operations than necessary. The corrected program, however, correctly maximizes the sum and uses the minimum number of operations required.

Final: **False**
