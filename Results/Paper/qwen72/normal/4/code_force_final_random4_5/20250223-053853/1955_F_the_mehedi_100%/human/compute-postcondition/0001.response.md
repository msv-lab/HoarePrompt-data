Output State: **The function `func` will print the value of `cnt` for each iteration of the loop, where `cnt` is calculated based on the input list `a` and the condition specified. The variables `a` and `cnt` will be re-initialized in each iteration, and their final values after the loop will be the values from the last iteration. The input list `a` will contain four integers, and `cnt` will be the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, plus 1 if all elements in `a` are odd.**
