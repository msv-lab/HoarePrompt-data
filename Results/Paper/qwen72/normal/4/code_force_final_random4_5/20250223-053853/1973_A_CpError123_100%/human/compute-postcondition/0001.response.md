The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `_` is a placeholder**
