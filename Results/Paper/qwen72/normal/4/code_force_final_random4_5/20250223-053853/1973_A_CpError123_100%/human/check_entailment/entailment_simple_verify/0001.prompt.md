You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players after playing chess games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: The loop will print either -1 or the minimum of (x, y) for each test case, where x is half of the sum of a, b, and c, and y is the sum of a and b. The values of p_1, p_2, and p_3 remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Validity of Scores**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because in any valid set of games, the total number of points must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (one draw).

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of points distributed as draws.
   - The program calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The program then prints `min(x, y)` as the maximum number of draws.

4. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - The total number of points distributed in draws is `x = (a + b + c) // 2`.
   - The maximum number of draws that can occur between the two players with the lowest scores is `y = a + b`.
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of these two values because:
     - `x` is the total number of points that can be distributed as draws.
     - `y` is the maximum number of draws that can occur between the two players with the lowest scores without exceeding their total points.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the sum of scores is odd and prints `-1` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) and prints `0` correctly.
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for valid test cases.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `0 0 0`, the sum is `0` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `0`.
   - For `0 1 1`, the sum is `2` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `1`.
   - For `1 1 1`, the sum is `3` (odd), so the program prints `-1`.
   - For `1 1 2`, the sum is `4` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2`.
   - For `3 3 3`, the sum is `9` (odd), so the program prints `-1`.
   - For `3 4 5`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `6`.
   - For `1 1 10`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the provided test cases and edge cases appropriately.
