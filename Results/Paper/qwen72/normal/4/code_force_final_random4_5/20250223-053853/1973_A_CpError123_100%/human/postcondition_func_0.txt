The function `func` takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, which represent the scores of three players. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not modified by the function.
