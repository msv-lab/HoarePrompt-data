Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading the scores `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total number of points must be even (each game results in either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).

3. **Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, assuming each game results in 2 points (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).
   - `y` is calculated as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all draws were between the first two players (since a draw results in 1 point for each player).

4. **Output**: The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is intended to ensure that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games played. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that the scores might not be achievable with the given number of draws and wins.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case `0 0 0`, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the case `0 1 1`, the function correctly prints `1` because one draw between the second and third players is possible.
   - For the case `1 1 1`, the function prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the case `1 1 2`, the function prints `2` because two draws between the first and second players and one win for the third player against either of the first two players is possible.
   - For the case `3 3 3`, the function prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the case `3 4 5`, the function prints `6` because six draws (three between the first and second players, and three between the second and third players) and one win for the third player against the first player is possible.
   - For the case `1 1 10`, the function prints `2` because two draws between the first and second players and the rest of the points coming from wins is possible.

However, the function does not correctly handle all edge cases. For example, in the case `3 3 3`, the function prints `-1`, but this is incorrect. The scores `3 3 3` can be achieved if each player wins one game and there are three draws (one draw for each pair of players).

### Correctness: **False**

The function's logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. It does not correctly account for the distribution of wins and draws to ensure that the scores are achievable. Specifically, the condition `if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0` is correct, but the calculation of `x` and `y` and the output of `min(x, y)` is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of draws.
