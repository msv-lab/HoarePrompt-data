Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the total points and checking if the sum of the points is even. If the sum is odd, it correctly prints `-1` because in a series of games where each game results in either 2 points (for a win) or 2 points (for a draw), the total points must be even. This is a valid check.

However, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program calculates `x` as half of the total points and `y` as the sum of the two lowest scores (`a` and `b`). It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y` as the maximum number of draws. This approach does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.

### Correct Logic:
1. **Total Points Must Be Even**: This is correctly checked by the program.
2. **Maximum Number of Draws**: The maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the following:
   - Each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - Each win/loss contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The maximum number of draws is the number of games that could have ended in a draw, which is the total number of games minus the number of win/loss games.
   - The total number of games is `(a + b + c) // 2` because each game contributes 2 points.
   - The number of win/loss games is `(c - a) // 2` because the highest score `c` must be at least `a` plus the number of win/loss games.

### Flaws in the Program:
- The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which is the total number of games, but it does not correctly account for the number of win/loss games.
- The program calculates `y` as `a + b`, which is the sum of the two lowest scores, but this does not necessarily represent the maximum number of draws.

### Correct Calculation:
- The correct maximum number of draws is `(a + b + c) // 2 - (c - a) // 2`.

### Example Analysis:
- For `0 0 0`, no games were played, so the answer is `0`.
- For `0 1 1`, one draw occurred, so the answer is `1`.
- For `1 1 1`, it is impossible to achieve these scores, so the answer is `-1`.
- For `1 1 2`, two draws occurred, so the answer is `2`.
- For `3 3 3`, it is impossible to achieve these scores, so the answer is `-1`.
- For `3 4 5`, six draws occurred, so the answer is `6`.
- For `1 1 10`, two draws occurred, so the answer is `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is incorrect, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
