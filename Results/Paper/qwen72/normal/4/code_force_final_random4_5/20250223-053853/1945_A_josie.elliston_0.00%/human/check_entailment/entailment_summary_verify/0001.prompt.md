You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three non-negative integer parameters `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, each between 0 and 10^9. It returns -1 if `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`, otherwise it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must have a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two other people.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means we cannot form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts and the available universals, so we return `None`.
   - Otherwise, we return the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by combining the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No participants (0, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` because no tents are needed.
     - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns `0` which is correct.
   - **Case 2: Only introverts (7, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` because no tents are needed for extroverts and universals.
     - `func_2(7, 0, 0)` returns `7` which is correct.
   - **Case 3: Only extroverts (0, 24, 0)**
     - `func_1(24, 0)` returns `8` because 24 extroverts can be divided into 8 tents of 3 people each.
     - `func_2(0, 24, 0)` returns `8` which is correct.
   - **Case 4: Only universals (0, 0, 10)**
     - `func_1(0, 10)` returns `4` because 10 universals can be divided into 4 tents (3, 3, 3, 1).
     - `func_2(0, 0, 10)` returns `4` which is correct.
   - **Case 5: Impossible to accommodate (1, 4, 1)**
     - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because 4 extroverts need 2 more people to form a complete tent, but only 1 universal is available.
     - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1` which is correct.

5. **General Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the distribution of extroverts and universals.
   - The function `func_2` correctly adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed for the participants based on their preferences. It handles all edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement.
