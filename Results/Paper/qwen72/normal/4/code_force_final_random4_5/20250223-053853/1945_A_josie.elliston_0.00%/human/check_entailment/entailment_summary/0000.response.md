### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a tent alone, so the number of tents required for introverts is exactly equal to the number of introverts.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. Therefore, the number of extroverts must be a multiple of 3. If it is not, we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be placed in any tent configuration, so they can be used to fill in the gaps left by extroverts or form their own tents.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for determining the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If so, it needs to see if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be paired with universals to form a complete tent.
   - If the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3, it returns `None` because it is impossible to form a complete tent.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of `func_1`, which gives the total number of tents required.

4. **Validation with Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - Extroverts: 2 (not divisible by 3, remainder is 2)
     - Universals: 3 (enough to form a complete tent with the 2 extroverts)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - Extroverts: 4 (not divisible by 3, remainder is 1)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a complete tent with the 1 extrovert)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - Extroverts: 4 (not divisible by 3, remainder is 1)
     - Universals: 2 (enough to form a complete tent with the 1 extrovert)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - Extroverts: 1 (not divisible by 3, remainder is 1)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a complete tent with the 1 extrovert)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - Extroverts: 3 (divisible by 3)
     - Universals: 2 (can form their own tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - Extroverts: 7 (not divisible by 3, remainder is 1)
     - Universals: 18 (enough to form a complete tent with the 1 extrovert)
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 7 (extroverts + universals) = 28
   - **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - No participants, so no tents are needed.
     - Total tents: 0
   - **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - Only introverts, so 7 tents are needed.
     - Total tents: 7
   - **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - Extroverts: 24 (divisible by 3)
     - Universals: 0 (not needed)
     - Total tents: 8
   - **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (divisible by 3)
     - Universals: 1000000000 (can form their own tents)
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + universals) = 1666666667
