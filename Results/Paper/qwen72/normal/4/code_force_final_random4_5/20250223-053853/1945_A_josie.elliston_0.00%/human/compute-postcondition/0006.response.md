The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. Both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers with a range of 0 to 10^9. 

Case_1: The function returns `None`.

Case_2: If the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 is not zero and the sum of this remainder and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, the function returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers `extroverts` and `universals`. If the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, it returns the ceiling of (extroverts + universals) / 3. Otherwise, it returns `None`.**
