Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the universals can form at least one full tent (i.e., `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`).
   - If this condition is not met, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as per the requirements.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents required.

The program handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including:
- Ensuring that each introvert gets a tent alone.
- Ensuring that each extrovert is in a tent with exactly two others.
- Using universals to fill in the remaining spots in the tents as needed.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected.
