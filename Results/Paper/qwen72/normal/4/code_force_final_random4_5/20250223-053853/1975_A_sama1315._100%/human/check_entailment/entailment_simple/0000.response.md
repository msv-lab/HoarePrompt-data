### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
   - The operation can be repeated any number of times.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: A list `a` of positive integers.
   - **Process**:
     - The function first sorts the list `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
     - It checks if any segment of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`.
     - If such a segment is found, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If no such segment is found after checking all possible segments, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The approach is correct because if a segment of `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, it means that by splitting `a` at the appropriate index and swapping the parts, we can achieve the sorted array.
     - The concatenation of `a` with itself ensures that all possible splits and swaps are considered.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Multiple test cases.
   - **Process**:
     - It reads the input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list `data`.
     - It iterates over the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the list `a` of integers.
     - It calls `func_1` with the list `a` and appends the result to `results`.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly handles the input and output format as specified.
     - It correctly processes each test case and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
     - The results are collected and printed in the correct format.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases and correctly determine if each array can be sorted by the specified operation.
   - Both functions are implemented correctly and work together to solve the problem as described.
