Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list called `results`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
