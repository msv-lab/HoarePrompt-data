### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if any contiguous segment of the array `a` repeated twice (i.e., `a + a`) matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - This approach is based on the idea that if the array can be split into two parts and swapped to become sorted, then there must exist a contiguous segment in the concatenated array `a + a` that is equal to the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - The function iterates through all possible starting points of the segment in the concatenated array and checks if the segment matches the sorted array.
   - If such a segment is found, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array `a` and collects the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

3. **Combining the Functions**:
   - The main function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the required check.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case: `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
     - The sorted array is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.
     - No contiguous segment in `a + a` matches the sorted array, so the function returns 'No'.
   - For the second test case: `a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
     - The sorted array is `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.
     - The segment `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` in `a + a` matches the sorted array, so the function returns 'Yes'.
   - For the third test case: `a = [1, 2, 3]`
     - The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - The segment `[1, 2, 3]` in `a + a` matches the sorted array, so the function returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to read the input, process each test case, and produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
