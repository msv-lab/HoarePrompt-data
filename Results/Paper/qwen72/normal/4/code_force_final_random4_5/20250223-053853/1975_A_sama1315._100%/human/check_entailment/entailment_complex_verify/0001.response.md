### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Input:** A list `a` of positive integers with length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).
   - **Output:** 'Yes' if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation, otherwise 'No'.
   - **Logic:**
     - The function first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
     - It then creates a concatenated version of the array `concatenated_a = a + a`.
     - The function checks if any subarray of length `n` within `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If no such subarray is found after checking all possible subarrays, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The logic is correct because if a subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, it means that the original array `a` can be split and swapped to form a sorted array.
     - The concatenation `a + a` ensures that all possible cyclic permutations of `a` are considered.
     - The function correctly handles the edge cases where the array is already sorted or cannot be sorted by any cyclic permutation.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Input:** Multiple test cases from standard input.
   - **Output:** For each test case, 'Yes' or 'No' indicating whether the array can be sorted.
   - **Logic:**
     - The function reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the arrays `a` for each test case.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly reads and processes the input data.
     - It correctly handles the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.
     - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
     - The results are printed in the correct format, with each result on a new line.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation.
- The assessment also mentions that the function `func_1` checks if any cyclic permutation of the array `a` matches the sorted version of `a`.
- The function `func_2` is described as correctly reading the input, processing each test case, and printing the results.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Reasoning:**
  - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly identifies whether the array can be sorted by any cyclic permutation.
  - The implementation in `func_2` is also correct and handles the input and output as required by the problem statement.
  - The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement.

- **Final:**
  - **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final evaluation is **True**.
