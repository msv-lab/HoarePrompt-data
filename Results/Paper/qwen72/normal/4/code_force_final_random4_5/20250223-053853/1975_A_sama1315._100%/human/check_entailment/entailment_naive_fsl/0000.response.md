Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the array). The function `func_1` checks if any cyclic permutation of the array `a` matches the sorted version of `a`. This is done by creating a concatenated version of the array `a + a` and then checking all possible subarrays of length `n` within this concatenated array to see if any of them match the sorted array `sorted_a`. If such a subarray is found, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the operation. If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'. The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results for all test cases. The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement.
