You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers with length n, where 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: If the loop finds a segment in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`, it will return 'Yes'. Otherwise, it will complete all iterations without returning anything. The variables `a`, `sorted_a`, and `concatenated_a` will remain unchanged.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers with a length between 2 and 50. It checks if any contiguous segment of the list `a` repeated twice (i.e., `a + a`) matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a segment is found, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function does not modify the input list `a`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - n - 1]`, `a` is a list of the last `n` integers from `data`, `data` is unchanged, `idx` is `1 + t * (n + 1)`, `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: [result_1]
    #[result_2]
    #...
    #[result_t] (where each result_i is the output of func_1 applied to a list of n integers from data)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a series of inputs from standard input, processes them, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of inputs where each set consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it applies the function `func_1` to the list `a` and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the `results` list to contain the outputs of `func_1` for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes `t` being the number of test cases, `n` being the last read integer from the input, `a` being the last list of `n` integers, `data` remaining unchanged, `idx` being `1 + t * (n + 1)`, and `results` being a list of `t` results.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the array). The function `func_1` checks if any cyclic permutation of the array `a` matches the sorted version of `a`. This is done by creating a concatenated version of the array `a + a` and then checking all possible subarrays of length `n` within this concatenated array to see if any of them match the sorted array `sorted_a`. If such a subarray is found, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the operation. If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'. The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results for all test cases. The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement.
