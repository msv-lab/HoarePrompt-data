### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Input Validation:** The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of positive integers with a length `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - **Logic:**
     - `n = len(a)`: This correctly calculates the length of the input list.
     - `sorted_a = sorted(a)`: This creates a sorted version of the input list.
     - `concatenated_a = a + a`: This concatenates the list with itself, effectively creating a cyclic version of the list.
     - The loop `for i in range(n)` iterates over all possible starting indices of a subarray of length `n` within `concatenated_a`.
     - The condition `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:` checks if any cyclic permutation of `a` matches the sorted version of `a`.
     - If a match is found, the function returns 'Yes'.
     - If no match is found after all iterations, the function returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The logic correctly identifies if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the array).
     - The use of `a + a` and the sliding window approach ensures that all possible cyclic permutations are checked.
     - The function handles the edge cases where the array is already sorted or cannot be sorted by the operation.

2. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Input Validation:** The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Logic:**
     - `input = sys.stdin.read`: This reads the entire input as a single string.
     - `data = input().split()`: This splits the input string into a list of strings.
     - `t = int(data[idx])`: This reads the number of test cases.
     - The loop `for _ in range(t)` iterates over each test case.
     - `n = int(data[idx])`: This reads the length of the array for the current test case.
     - `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))`: This reads the array elements for the current test case and converts them to integers.
     - `result = func_1(a)`: This calls `func_1` with the current array and stores the result.
     - `results.append(result)`: This appends the result to the `results` list.
     - `print('\n'.join(results))`: This prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
     - The final results are printed in the correct format.

### Final Evaluation:
- **Original Assessment:** The original assessment was correct. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation and handles the input and output as required by the problem statement.
- **Final:** **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
