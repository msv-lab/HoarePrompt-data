Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads a series of inputs from standard input, processes them, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of inputs where each set consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it applies the function `func_1` to the list `a` and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the `results` list to contain the outputs of `func_1` for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes `t` being the number of test cases, `n` being the last read integer from the input, `a` being the last list of `n` integers, `data` remaining unchanged, `idx` being `1 + t * (n + 1)`, and `results` being a list of `t` results. **
