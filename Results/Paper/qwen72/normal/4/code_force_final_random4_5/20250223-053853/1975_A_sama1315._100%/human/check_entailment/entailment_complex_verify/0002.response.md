### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping them.
   - This operation can be visualized as finding a segment in the array that, when moved to the beginning, results in a sorted array.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - The function `func_1(a)` is designed to check if the array `a` can be sorted by performing the split and swap operation.
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then creates a concatenated array `concatenated_a` by appending `a` to itself (`a + a`).
   - The function iterates through the concatenated array and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

   **Evaluation of `func_1(a)`**:
   - The logic of concatenating `a` with itself is correct because it allows us to consider all possible splits of the array.
   - By checking if any subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, we are effectively checking if there is a way to split and swap the array to make it non-decreasing.
   - This approach is valid and efficient for the given constraints.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` to check if the array can be sorted and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

   **Evaluation of `func_2()`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results in the required format, with each result on a new line.

4. **Validation of the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and implementation of both functions.
   - The reasoning provided in the assessment is accurate and aligns with the problem requirements and constraints.
   - The approach in `func_1(a)` is valid and efficient, and `func_2()` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions are correctly implemented to solve the given problem. The approach in `func_1(a)` is valid and efficient for the given constraints, and `func_2()` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
