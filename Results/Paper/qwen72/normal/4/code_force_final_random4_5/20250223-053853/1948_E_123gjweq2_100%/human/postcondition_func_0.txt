The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the number of cliques as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`. The function then prints the elements of a list `arr` of length `n`, where each element represents the clique index (1-indexed) to which the corresponding element belongs. It also prints the number of cliques and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` contains the clique indices, and `cliquess` remains a list of `n` zeros.
