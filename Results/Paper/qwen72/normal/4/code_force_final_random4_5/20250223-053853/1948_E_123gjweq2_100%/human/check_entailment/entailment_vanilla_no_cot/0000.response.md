Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Scope of `arr` and `cliquess`**:
   - The variables `arr` and `cliquess` are defined in the `func_1` function but are used in the `make_array` function. However, they are not passed as arguments to `make_array`, which means they are not accessible within `make_array`. This will result in a `NameError` when the program is run.

2. **Incorrect Clique Assignment**:
   - The logic for assigning vertices to cliques in the `make_array` function is flawed. The way the elements are assigned to `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. Specifically, the way `mid` and `not_mid` are calculated and used to assign elements does not guarantee that the edges will be correctly formed according to the given condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, when \( n \) is not a multiple of \( k \), the last clique might have fewer elements than \( k \), and the program does not correctly account for this.

### Corrected Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to ensure that the vertices are assigned values such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. One possible approach is to assign values in a way that minimizes the number of cliques and ensures that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = (i % k) + 1
        cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1

    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Example usage:
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().strip().split())
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Clique Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
- **Vertex Assignment**: Each vertex \( i \) is assigned a value \( a_i = (i \% k) + 1 \). This ensures that the values are distinct and range from 1 to \( k \).
- **Clique Assignment**: Each vertex \( i \) is assigned to a clique based on its position, `cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1`. This ensures that vertices are partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

This approach ensures that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques and that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs of vertices in the same clique.
