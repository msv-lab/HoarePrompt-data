### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires assigning integers to vertices such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - For each pair of vertices \( (i, j) \), an edge is added if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, and each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n` with zeros.
     - It then calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the appropriate indices and clique number.
     - After the loops, it prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.

   - **Function 2 (`make_array`)**:
     - This function is responsible for assigning values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for a specific clique.
     - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on the `left` and `right` indices.
     - It then assigns values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in a specific pattern to ensure that the vertices within the same clique are connected.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Initial State**:
     - `n` and `k` are integers such that \( 2 \le n \le 40 \) and \( 1 \le k \le 2n \).
     - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to lists of zeros of length `n`.

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - `cliques` is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct for determining the minimum number of cliques.
     - The `make_array` function is called for each clique, ensuring that the vertices are assigned values and clique numbers correctly.

   - **Function 2 (`make_array`)**:
     - `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated correctly.
     - The `mid` and `not_mid` variables are used to split the range `[left, right]` into two parts.
     - The first loop assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in increasing order to the `arr` array and assigns the clique number to the `cliquess` array.
     - The second loop assigns values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` in decreasing order to the `arr` array and assigns the clique number to the `cliquess` array.

4. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - **Case where \( k \ge n \)**:
     - When \( k \ge n \), the graph should be a single clique.
     - The program correctly calculates `cliques` as `ceil(n / k)`, which will be 1 in this case.
     - The `make_array` function is called with `left = 0` and `right = n - 1`, and `clique = 1`.
     - The `make_array` function will assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` such that all vertices are in the same clique.
     - Therefore, the program handles this edge case correctly.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where \( k \ge n \) correctly.
   - However, based on the analysis, the program does handle this case correctly by ensuring all vertices are in a single clique when \( k \ge n \).

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **inaccurate**.
- The program correctly handles the case where \( k \ge n \) and ensures that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
- Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
