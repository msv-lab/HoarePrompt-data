Output State: `left` and `right` remain unchanged. `clique` remains unchanged. `small_element` remains unchanged. `big_element` remains unchanged. `mid` remains unchanged. `not_mid` remains unchanged. The elements in the range [left, left + mid - 1] of the `arr` array are assigned values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in increasing order. The elements in the range [left, left + mid - 1] of the `cliquess` array are assigned the value `clique`. The elements in the range [left + mid, left + mid + not_mid - 1] of the `arr` array are assigned values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` in decreasing order. The elements in the range [left + mid, left + mid + not_mid - 1] of the `cliquess` array are assigned the value `clique`.
