Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.

    #State: `n` and `k` remain the same; `cliques` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`; `arr` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the index of the clique it belongs to (1-indexed); `cliquess` remains a list of `n` zeros.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: - The output will be the elements of `arr` printed in a space-separated format.
    #
    #Output:
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: - The `print(cliques)` statement will print the value of `cliques`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cliques`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`.
    #
    #Output:
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: - The output will be a sequence of `n` zeros separated by spaces.

#Function 2:
