The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is typically used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0**
