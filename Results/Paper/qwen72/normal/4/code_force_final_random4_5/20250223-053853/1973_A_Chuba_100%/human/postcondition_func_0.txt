The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` from the input, representing the scores of three players. If the sum of these scores is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates a result based on the scores and prints this result. The function does not modify the input scores and performs these operations for each of the `t` test cases.
