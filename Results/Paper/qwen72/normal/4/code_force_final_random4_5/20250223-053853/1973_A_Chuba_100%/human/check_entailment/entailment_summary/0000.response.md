Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players. The key points to consider are:

1. **Sum of Scores**: The sum of the scores of all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw). If the sum is odd, it is impossible to achieve the given scores, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the fact that the total points from wins and losses must be subtracted from the total points to get the points from draws. The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the points of the highest scorer are not more than the sum of the points of the other two players, which would be impossible to achieve without invalid draws.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - For `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and no games were played, so the result is 0.
   - For `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and one draw could have occurred between the second and third players.
   - For `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), so it is impossible to achieve these scores, and the result is -1.
   - For `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and two draws could have occurred.
   - For `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), so it is impossible to achieve these scores, and the result is -1.
   - For `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - For `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 2.

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
