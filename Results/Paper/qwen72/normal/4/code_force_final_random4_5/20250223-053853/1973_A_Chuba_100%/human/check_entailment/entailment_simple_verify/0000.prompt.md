You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players after all the games.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged. The loop prints a series of results or `-1` for each iteration based on the input values `v` provided during each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 2 points being added in case of a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program then calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{\text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]})}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that:
   - The total number of points is divided by 2 to account for the points from draws.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This is necessary because if `v[2]` is too high, it means there are more points than can be explained by the games played.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played**: If all scores are 0, the program correctly prints `0` because no draws can occur.
   - **Single Draw**: If the scores are such that one draw could have occurred (e.g., `0 1 1`), the program correctly prints `1`.
   - **Inconsistent Scores**: If the scores are inconsistent (e.g., `1 1 1`), the program correctly prints `-1` because the total score is odd.
   - **Multiple Draws**: For cases where multiple draws could have occurred (e.g., `1 1 2`), the program correctly prints `2`.

4. **General Validity**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the scores are valid and the maximum number of draws can be calculated.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the scores are invalid and prints `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
