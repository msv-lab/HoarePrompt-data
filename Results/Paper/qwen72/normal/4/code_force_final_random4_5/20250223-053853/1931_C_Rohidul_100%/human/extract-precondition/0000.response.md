Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the array elements. The function should be designed to handle these inputs and compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The total number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
