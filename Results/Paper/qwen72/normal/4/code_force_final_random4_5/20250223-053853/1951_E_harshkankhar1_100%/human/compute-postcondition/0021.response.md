Postcondition: ***`s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1. The substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1` (i.e., `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`). Additionally, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.***
