### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(s) -> bool`**
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input and processes it to determine if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - **Step 1: Check if the entire string is non-palindromic.**
     - If `func_1(s[0:])` returns `False`, it means the string `s` is not a palindrome.
     - In this case, the function prints "YES", followed by `1` and the string `s` itself, as the entire string is already a valid partition.
     - This step is correct.

   - **Step 2: Find the first character that is different from the first character.**
     - The function iterates through the string `s` to find the first index `i` where `s[i]` is different from `s[0]`.
     - If such an index is found, it sets `x` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If no such index is found, it means all characters in the string are the same, and the string is a palindrome.
     - In this case, the function prints "NO" and returns.
     - This step is correct.

   - **Step 3: Check if the remaining substring is non-palindromic.**
     - If `x` is not `-1`, the function checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is non-palindromic.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is non-palindromic, it prints "YES", followed by `2` and the two substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This step is correct.

   - **Step 4: Handle special cases.**
     - If `x` is `1` or `x` is `n // 2`, the function prints "NO".
     - This is incorrect because:
       - If `x` is `1`, it means the first two characters are different, and the rest of the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
       - If `x` is `n // 2`, it does not necessarily mean the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, if `s = "abccba"`, `x` would be `3`, but the string can be partitioned into "abc" and "cba".
     - Therefore, this step is incorrect.

   - **Step 5: Fallback to a valid partition.**
     - If the above conditions are not met, the function prints "YES", followed by `2` and the two substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
     - This step is correct because it ensures that the substrings are non-palindromic by including at least one more character in the first substring.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a logical error in handling the special cases where `x` is `1` or `x` is `n // 2`. These conditions do not necessarily mean that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying this logical error.

### Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical error in handling the special cases where `x` is `1` or `x` is `n // 2`. These conditions should not lead to a "NO" output in all cases.
