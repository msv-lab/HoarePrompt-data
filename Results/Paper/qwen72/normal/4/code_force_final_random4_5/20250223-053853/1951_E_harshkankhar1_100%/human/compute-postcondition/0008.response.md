The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The variable `i` should be set to 1 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is -1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 1**
