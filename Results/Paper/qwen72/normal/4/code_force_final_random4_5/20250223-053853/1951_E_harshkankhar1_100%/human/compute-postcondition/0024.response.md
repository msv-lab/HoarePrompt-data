Let's analyze the given code and the initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
- `x` is not -1, meaning such a character exists.
- The substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1` (i.e., `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`).
- `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - Since `x` is not -1, we know that such a character exists in the string.
   - `x` is not 1, so the first character different from `s[0]` is not at index 1.
   - `x` is not `n // 2`, so the first character different from `s[0]` is not at the middle index of the string.

2. **Substrings**:
   - `s[:x + 2]` is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
   - `s[x + 2:]` is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output two substrings separated by a space.
   - The first substring `s[:x + 2]` includes all characters from the start of the string up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
   - The second substring `s[x + 2:]` includes all characters from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

### Example:
- Suppose `s = "aaabbbccc"`.
  - `s[0]` is 'a'.
  - The first character different from 'a' is 'b' at index 3.
  - `x` is 3.
  - `s[:x + 2]` is `s[:5]` which is "aaaab".
  - `s[x + 2:]` is `s[5:]` which is "bbccc".
  - The output will be: "aaaab bbccc".

### General Case:
- The exact value of `s` is not provided, but we know that `s` has a structure where the first `x` characters are the same as `s[0]`, and the character at index `x` is different.
- The substring `s[:x + 2]` will include the first `x + 1` characters of `s`.
- The substring `s[x + 2:]` will include the remaining characters of `s` starting from index `x + 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where `s[:x + 2]` is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, and `s[x + 2:]` is the substring from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of `s`)**.
