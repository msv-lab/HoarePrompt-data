The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and each inner list in `cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of stones in each pile. The constraints are as follows: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, and each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, the function determines a specific output based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It returns a list of results, where each result is determined based on the number of stones in each pile for the corresponding test case.**
