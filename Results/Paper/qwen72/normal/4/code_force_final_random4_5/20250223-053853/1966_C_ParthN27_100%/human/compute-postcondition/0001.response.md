Output State: **The loop will iterate t times, and for each iteration, it will read n and a list of integers, process the list to determine if the game is won by Alice or Bob, and print the winner. After all iterations, the variables t, n, arr, s, ans, and i will be in their final states as determined by the last iteration of the loop, but the specific values will depend on the input provided for the last test case. The list s will be a sorted list of unique elements from the last arr list, with 0 prepended, and ans will be 1 if the last game is won by Alice, or 0 if won by Bob.**
