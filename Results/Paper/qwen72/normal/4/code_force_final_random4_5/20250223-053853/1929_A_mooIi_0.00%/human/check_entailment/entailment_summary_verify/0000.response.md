Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the program sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string, which is not the required output.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output:
```
1 2 3
```
This is clearly incorrect as it does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array in descending order to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
2. Compute the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The function summary confirms that the function `func` does not return any value and only prints the sorted array, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

A correct implementation, as suggested in the original assessment, would be:
```python
def max_beauty():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort(reverse=True)
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This implementation correctly sorts the array in descending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which will give the maximum beauty of the array.

Final: **False**
