Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as a string, which is not the correct output. The problem requires calculating the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) after rearranging the elements to maximize this sum. The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, involves sorting the array in descending order and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The provided program fails to perform these steps and thus does not solve the problem correctly.

Final: **False**
