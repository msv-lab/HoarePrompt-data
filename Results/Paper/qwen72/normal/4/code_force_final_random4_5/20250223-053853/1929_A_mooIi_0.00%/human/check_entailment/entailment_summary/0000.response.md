Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The goal is to calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The program, however, only sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string. This does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Compute the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
3. Print the computed sum for each test case.

The current program only performs step 1 and prints the sorted array, which is not the required output.

Correctness: **False**
