The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, sorts the list, and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers are not retained after the function completes.
