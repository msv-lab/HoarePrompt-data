Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted array, which does not compute the maximum beauty.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Compute the maximum beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The current program only sorts the array and prints it, which is not the required output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
