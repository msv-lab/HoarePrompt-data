Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `a` is an input string that must have at least one character, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 1, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. Additionally, `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`.**
