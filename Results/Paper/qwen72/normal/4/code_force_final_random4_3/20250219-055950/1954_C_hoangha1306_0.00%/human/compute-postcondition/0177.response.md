Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length and at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `vt` is 0 or 1. If `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each updated by appending the character at index 2 of `a` to their respective values, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `x` is the smaller of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the larger of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, and `a[2]` is greater than `b[2]`, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 1, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x`.***
