Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is an input string; `b` is an input string; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with at least one character; `kq1` and `kq2` are strings; `i` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` each contain the first character of `a`, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `vt` is 1 if it was initially 0. If the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b` and `vt` was initially 0, `kq1` contains the string representation of `x` and `kq2` contains the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` was initially 0, `kq1` contains the string representation of `y` and `kq2` contains the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not initially 0, `kq1` contains the string representation of `y` and `kq2` contains the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 2 characters; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both concatenated with the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller of the integers represented by the second character of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger of the integers represented by the second character of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`. If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 3 characters; `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both concatenated with the third character of `a`. If `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `x` is the smaller integer represented by the third character of `a` or `b`, and `y` is the larger integer represented by the third character of `a` or `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` and `kq2` remain unchanged. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
