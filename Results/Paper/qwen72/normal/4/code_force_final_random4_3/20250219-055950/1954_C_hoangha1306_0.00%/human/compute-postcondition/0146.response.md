Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` is the smaller of the first digits of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the first digits of `a` and `b`, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is set to 1. If the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
