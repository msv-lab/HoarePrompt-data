Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of the same length as `a` and `b`, and `vt` is 1 if there was at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` were different, otherwise `vt` remains 0.**
