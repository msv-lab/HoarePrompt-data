Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 2 characters; `i` is 1; `vt` is 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` string concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` string concatenated with the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original `kq1` string concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` string concatenated with the string representation of `x`.***
