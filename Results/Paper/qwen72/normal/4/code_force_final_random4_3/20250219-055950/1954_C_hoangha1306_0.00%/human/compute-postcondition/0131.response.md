Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0, `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is the first character of `a`, `vt` is 0, and the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
