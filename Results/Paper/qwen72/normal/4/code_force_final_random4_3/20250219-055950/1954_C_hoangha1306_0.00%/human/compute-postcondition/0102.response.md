Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` are both updated to include the second character of `a` appended to their previous values, and `vt` remains 0. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `y` is the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, and `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`: if `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` includes the string representation of `x` appended to its previous value, and `kq2` includes the string representation of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` includes the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` includes the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was initially 0, it is set to 1.**
