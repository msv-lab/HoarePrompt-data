Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `a` and `b` are input strings with at least one character, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, `vt` is 1 if the initial value of `vt` was 0, otherwise `vt` is not 0, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. If the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b` and `vt` was initially 0, `kq1` contains the value of `x` and `kq2` contains the value of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` was initially 0, `kq1` contains the string representation of `y` and `kq2` contains the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not initially 0, `kq1` contains the value of `y` and `kq2` contains the value of `x`.***
