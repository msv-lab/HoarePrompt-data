The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on the inputs is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are large integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the provided information.**
