The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 0 before the decrement. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is just an iterator variable that is not used in the loop body.

State: **`n` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` == 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` == 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. Otherwise, `cx` now contains the integer `x`.**
