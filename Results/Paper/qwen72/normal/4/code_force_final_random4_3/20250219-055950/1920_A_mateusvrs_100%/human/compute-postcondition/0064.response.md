Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to 2, and `cx` now contains `x` as an element.***
