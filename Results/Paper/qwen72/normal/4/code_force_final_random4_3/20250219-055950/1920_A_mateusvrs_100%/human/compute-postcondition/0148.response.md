The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases, each with a set of constraints. Each test case is defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and for each test case, there is an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). It is guaranteed that each test case contains at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a set of constraints. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case based on these constraints.**
