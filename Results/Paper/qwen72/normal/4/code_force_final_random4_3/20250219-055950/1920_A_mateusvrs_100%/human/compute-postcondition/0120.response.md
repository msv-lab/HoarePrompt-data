Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `cx` now contains `x`.***
