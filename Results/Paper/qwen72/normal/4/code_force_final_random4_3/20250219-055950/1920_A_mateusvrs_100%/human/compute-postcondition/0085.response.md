The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `cx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `i` will be the first element of `cx` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0, `cx` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `cx`**
