Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, and `_` is a placeholder that is not adjusted.
- The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes user input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values to `a` and `x`.
- The values of `a` and `x` are now provided by the user input, and the initial state of `n` and `_` remains unchanged.
- The conditions for updating `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are not executed in this snippet, so they are not affected.
