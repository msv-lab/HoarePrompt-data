The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `cx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cx`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element in `cx`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1 if the second element in `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` remains 0.**
