Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes:
     - `cx` as a set to keep track of values that `k` must not be equal to.
     - `ax` as a very large number (`1000000007`) to represent the initial upper bound.
     - `bx` as a very small number (`-1`) to represent the initial lower bound.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - The program iterates over each constraint and updates the bounds and the set `cx` accordingly:
     - If the constraint type is `1` (k must be greater than or equal to `x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is `2` (k must be less than or equal to `x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is `3` (k must not be equal to `x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Validity Check**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if the lower bound `bx` is greater than the upper bound `ax`. If this is the case, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, indicating that no valid `k` exists.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the program calculates the number of valid `k` values by:
     - Counting the number of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive) and storing this count in `tmp`.
     - Appending `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the result list `r`, which represents the total number of integers in the range minus the invalid values.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, one per line, using `print(*r, sep='\n')`.

**Detailed Analysis**:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where there are no valid `k` values (i.e., `bx > ax`), as it appends `0` to the result list.
  - It also correctly handles the case where there are valid `k` values but some of them are excluded by the `cx` set.

- **Correctness of Bounds**:
  - The initial values of `ax` and `bx` are chosen appropriately to ensure that any valid constraint will update them correctly.
  - The use of `max` and `min` functions ensures that `bx` and `ax` are updated to the correct bounds based on the constraints.

- **Handling of `cx`**:
  - The program correctly uses a set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to, ensuring that duplicates are not counted.
  - The loop that counts the invalid values within the range `[bx, ax]` is implemented correctly.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the invalid values from the total range.

**Conclusion**:
The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**
