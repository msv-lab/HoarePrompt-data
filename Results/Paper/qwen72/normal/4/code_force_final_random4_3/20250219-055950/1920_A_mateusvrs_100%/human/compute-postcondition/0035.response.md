Postcondition: **`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, and `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.**
