The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, and `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is not adjusted, `t` is decreased by 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If `bx` â‰¤ `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` is a list with one additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `t` must be greater than 0.**
