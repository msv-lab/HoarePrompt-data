Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, if `bx` > `ax`, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If `bx` â‰¤ `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` is a list with one additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ax` is updated to `1000000007` (which is `1000000000 + 7`).
- The values of `n`, `_`, `bx`, `cx`, and the conditions for `r` and `t` remain unchanged.
