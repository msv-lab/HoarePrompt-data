Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can choose, under the given constraints.**
