Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 2, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[2] + 2) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`.
- The code snippet updates `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`.
- Since `i` is 2, the new value of `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`, which is the same as the initial value of `t1`.
- Therefore, the value of `t1` remains unchanged.
- The states of the other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `present`, `i`, `t2`) are not affected by the code snippet.
- The condition for `ans` is not affected by the code snippet, so it remains as it was in the initial state.
