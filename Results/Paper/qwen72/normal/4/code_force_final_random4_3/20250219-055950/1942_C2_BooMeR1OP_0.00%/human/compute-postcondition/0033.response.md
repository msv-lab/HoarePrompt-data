The code snippet `gaps.append(gap)` adds the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `n` is the number of sides of the polygon.
- `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.
- `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is `x - 2 + count`.
- `next_elem` is `a[2]` if `x > 2`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`.
- `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`.
- If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`; otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `gap` is appended to the list `gaps`.

Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `next_elem` is `a[2]` if `x > 2`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`.**
