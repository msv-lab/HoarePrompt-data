Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `next_elem` is `a[2]` if `x > 2`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `next_elem` based on the current value of `i` and the length of `a` which is `x`.
- If `x` is greater than 2, `next_elem` is set to `a[2]` because `(i + 1) % x` evaluates to `2` when `i` is `1`.
- If `x` is 2 or less, `next_elem` is set to `a[1] + n` because `(i + 1) % x` evaluates to `0` when `i` is `1` and `x` is 2, and the condition `i == x - 1` is true, adding `n` to `a[1]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `present`, `i`, `ans`, `gap`, `gaps`) remain unchanged.
