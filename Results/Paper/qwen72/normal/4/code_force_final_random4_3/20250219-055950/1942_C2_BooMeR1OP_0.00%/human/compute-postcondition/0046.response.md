Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose minus `gap // 2`, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2 + count + gap`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least one element, `gap` is the first element in `gaps`, `pairs` is `gap // 2`.** 

The value of `y` is updated by subtracting the value of `pairs` (which is `gap // 2`) from it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
