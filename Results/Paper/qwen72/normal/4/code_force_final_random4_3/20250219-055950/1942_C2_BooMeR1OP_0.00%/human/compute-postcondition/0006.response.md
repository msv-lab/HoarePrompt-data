The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables and the set `present` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `i` is 0**
