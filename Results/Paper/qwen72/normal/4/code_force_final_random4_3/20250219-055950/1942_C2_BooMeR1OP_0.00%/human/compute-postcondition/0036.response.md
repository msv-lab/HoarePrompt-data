Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `next_elem` is `a[3]` if `x > 3`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `next_elem` is updated to `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`.
- Given `i` is 2, the expression `(i + 1) % x` evaluates to `3 % x`.
- If `x > 3`, then `(3 % x)` is 3, and `next_elem` is set to `a[3]`.
- If `x <= 3`, then `(3 % x)` is 0 or 1, and `next_elem` is set to `a[1] + n` because `i` is not equal to `x - 1`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `present`, `i`, `ans`, and `gap` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `gaps` remains the same: if `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list.
