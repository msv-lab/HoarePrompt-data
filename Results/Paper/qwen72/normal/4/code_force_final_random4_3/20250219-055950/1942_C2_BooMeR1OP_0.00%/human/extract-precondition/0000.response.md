Precondition: **The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` chosen vertices. For example: `def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
