Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user with the first element removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `a[0]` is 0, the first element (0) is removed from the list. The length of the list `a` is now reduced by 1, so `i` is updated to `len(a) - 1`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
