The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**
