Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is incremented by 1.
- If the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, `res` was initially 2, so now it is 3.
- If the first element of `a` is 0 but the second element is not 0, `res` was initially 1, so now it is 2.
- If the first element of `a` is not 0, `res` was initially 0, so now it is 1.
- The states of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.
