Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 1, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer, and `a` remains a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed. The variable `i` will be `len(a) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. The variable `res` will be the total number of zeros found in the list `a`.
