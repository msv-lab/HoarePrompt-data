The variables in the loop head are `a` and the condition `a[-1] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be a non-empty list, and its last element must be 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element removed (previously 0), so the last element of `a` is no longer 0. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `a` so that its last element is 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element 0, `res` is 0**
