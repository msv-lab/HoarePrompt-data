Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 1, and `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `a` is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0. If the first element of `a` is not 0, `res` remains 0.***
