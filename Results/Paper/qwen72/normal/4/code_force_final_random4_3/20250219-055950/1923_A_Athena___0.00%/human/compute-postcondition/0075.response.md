The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers with at least one trailing zero, the last element is a zero. After removing this element, the length of `a` is reduced by 1. The value of `i` is `len(a) - 1`, so `i` is also reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and at least one trailing zero removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (reduced by the number of leading zeros and one trailing zero), and `res` is 0**
