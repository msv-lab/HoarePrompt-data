Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` and `c` are input integers.
   - `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`).
   - `b` is equal to `c`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state provides information about various variables and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
