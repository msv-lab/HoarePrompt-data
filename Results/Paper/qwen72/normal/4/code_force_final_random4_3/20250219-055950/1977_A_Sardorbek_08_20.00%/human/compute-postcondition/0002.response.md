Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers.**

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `b` and `c` are assigned the values of two integers provided by the user input, which are split and converted to integers.
