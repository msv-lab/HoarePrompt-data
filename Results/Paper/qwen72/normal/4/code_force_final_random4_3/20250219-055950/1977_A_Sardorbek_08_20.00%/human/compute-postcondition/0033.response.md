Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- `a` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` and `c` are input integers.
- `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`).
- If `b` == `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`.
- If `b` < `c`, then `b` is less than `c`.
- If `b` >= `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `b` is not equal to `c`.
- Additionally, if `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`.
- If `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and conditions, but none of this information is used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

Output: **No**
