The code snippet `q = b, c` creates a tuple `q` containing the values of `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are provided as input integers, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers, `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`).**
