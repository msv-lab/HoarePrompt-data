Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `a` (the final value of `i` is equal to `a`), `b` and `c` are the last input integers, and `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`). If `b` == `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` < `c`, then `b` is less than `c`. If `b` >= `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `b` is not equal to `c`. Additionally, if `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`. If `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain integers within the range 1 to 100.
- The value of `a` is the same as the initial input value, and it is greater than or equal to 0.
- The loop variable `i` has completed all iterations and is now equal to `a`.
- The variables `b` and `c` hold the last pair of integers input during the loop.
- The tuple `q` contains the last pair of integers (`b`, `c`) input during the loop.
- The conditions for printing 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' are based on the last input values of `b` and `c`, and the parity of `a` and `b`.
