The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function is designed to work within a context where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function's output is not specified in the given information, but it is expected to handle these test cases and produce some output based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Since the output is not clearly defined, we can only describe the input parameters and the context in which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function operates within a context where it handles `t` test cases, with each test case involving two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The specific output for each test case is not provided, but the function is expected to produce some result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
