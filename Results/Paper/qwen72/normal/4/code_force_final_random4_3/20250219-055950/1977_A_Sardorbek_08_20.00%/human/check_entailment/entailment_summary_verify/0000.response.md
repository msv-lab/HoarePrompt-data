### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. This condition is indeed incorrect because it checks the parity of the number of test cases `a` against the parity of the number of moves `b`, which is not relevant to the problem. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to ensure that the number of moves `b` and the target number of cubes `c` have the same parity.

Let's break down the correct logic for the problem:

1. **If `b == c`:** This means the number of moves is exactly equal to the target number of cubes. In this case, Nikita can simply add `c` cubes one by one, so the answer is "Yes".
2. **If `b < c`:** This means the number of moves is less than the target number of cubes. It is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".
3. **If `b % 2 == c % 2`:** This means that the number of moves `b` and the target number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). This is important because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be an integer, and the parity of `b` and `c` must match for this to be possible. For example, if `b` is even and `c` is even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in such a way that the final number of cubes is `c`. Similarly, if `b` is odd and `c` is odd, the same logic applies.
4. **Otherwise:** If the parities of `b` and `c` do not match, it is impossible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves, so the answer is "No".

The original program fails to correctly implement the third condition, leading to incorrect outputs for some test cases. For example, the test case `4 2` should output "Yes" because both `4` and `2` are even, but the program will output "No" because it checks `a % 2 == b % 2` instead of `b % 2 == c % 2`.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` to ensure that the number of moves `b` and the target number of cubes `c` have the same parity.
