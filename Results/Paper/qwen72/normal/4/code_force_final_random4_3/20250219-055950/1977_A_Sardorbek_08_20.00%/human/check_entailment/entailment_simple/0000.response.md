### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` which represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` respectively.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function checks if `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes). If they are equal, it prints "YES" because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `a % 2 == b % 2`, it prints "Yes". This condition checks if the parity (odd or even) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, this condition is incorrect. The parity of `a` (number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to ensure that the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which means Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

3. **Correct Conditions**:
   - The correct conditions to determine if Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes are:
     - If `b` is equal to `c`, Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by simply adding one cube per move.
     - If `b` is less than `c`, it is impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
     - If `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and the difference between `b` and `c` is even (`b % 2 == c % 2`), Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs.

4. **Incorrect Condition**:
   - The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect and should be replaced with `b % 2 == c % 2`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program contains a logical error in the condition `a % 2 == b % 2`. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to ensure that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary for Nikita to be able to achieve the desired number of cubes.
