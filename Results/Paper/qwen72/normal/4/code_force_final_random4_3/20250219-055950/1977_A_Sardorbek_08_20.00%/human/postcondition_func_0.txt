The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, and then for each of the `a` test cases, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). Otherwise, it prints 'No'. After the function concludes, `a` is the number of test cases processed, `b` and `c` are the last input integers, and `q` is a tuple containing the last values of `b` and `c`.
