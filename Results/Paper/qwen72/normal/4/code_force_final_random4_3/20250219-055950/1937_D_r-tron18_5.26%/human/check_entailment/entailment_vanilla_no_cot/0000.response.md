Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined as:
     ```python
     def func_1(arr, times):
         l = len(arr)
         return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
     ```
   - The variable `n` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`, which will cause a `NameError` when the function is called.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to handle the pinball movement and calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.
   - However, the logic inside the function is overly complex and does not correctly simulate the pinball movement as described in the problem statement.
   - The use of `preOne` and `suffZero` lists and the `func_1` function is not clearly aligned with the problem's requirements. The calculations involving these lists are not straightforward and do not seem to correctly model the pinball's movement and the grid's state changes.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results directly inside the `func_2` function, which is not a standard practice. Typically, the results should be returned and then printed outside the function.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach to solve this problem would involve simulating the pinball's movement for each cell and keeping track of the time it takes to leave the grid. Here is a simplified version of the solution:

```python
def pinball_movement(s):
    n = len(s)
    left_times = [0] * n
    right_times = [0] * n
    
    # Calculate the time to leave the grid from the left
    time = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '<':
            left_times[i] = time
            time += 1
        else:
            time = 0
    
    # Calculate the time to leave the grid from the right
    time = 0
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '>':
            right_times[i] = time
            time += 1
        else:
            time = 0
    
    # Calculate the total time for each cell
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '<':
            ans[i] = i + 1 + right_times[i]
        else:
            ans[i] = n - i + left_times[i]
    
    return ans

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    result = pinball_movement(s)
    print(*result)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
- **Left Times**: For each cell, if the character is '<', we calculate the time it takes to reach the left border and store it in `left_times`.
- **Right Times**: Similarly, for each cell, if the character is '>', we calculate the time it takes to reach the right border and store it in `right_times`.
- **Final Calculation**: For each cell, the total time to leave the grid is the sum of the time to move to the border and the time to move back to the initial position (due to the inversion of the grid).

This approach ensures that the pinball's movement is correctly simulated and the results are accurate.
