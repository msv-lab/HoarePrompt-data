Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` and an integer `n`, where `s1` consists of characters '<' and '>' and has a length `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It processes the string to calculate a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element at index `i` represents a value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The final state of the program includes the original string `s1`, the integer `n`, an empty list `preOne`, and a list `suffZero` containing cumulative sums of indices (1-based) of all '<' characters in `s1`, starting with 0. The list `ans` contains the calculated values for each index in `s1`. **
