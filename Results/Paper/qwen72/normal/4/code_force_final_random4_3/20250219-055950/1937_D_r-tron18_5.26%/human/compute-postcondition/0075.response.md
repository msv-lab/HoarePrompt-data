Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 2 + n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value of the sum of the last two elements in the list `suffZero`.
- The last element of `suffZero` is `n - 2`.
- The second last element of `suffZero` is `0`.
- Therefore, `zeroInd` is `n - 2 + 0` which simplifies to `n - 2 + n - 2` or `2 * (n - 2)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
