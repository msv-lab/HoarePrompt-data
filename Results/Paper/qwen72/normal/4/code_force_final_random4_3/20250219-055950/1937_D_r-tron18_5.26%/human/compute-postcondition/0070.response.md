Postcondition: ***`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0. If `ol` (the number of '>' characters) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), then `zeroInd` is `2 * k`, where `k` is the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[n - 3]` is `2 * k - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, if `ol` is greater than `zr`, then `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.***
