Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, `i + 1`], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` updates the value of `ans[i]`.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `zeroInd` is `n - 1`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- Therefore, `ans[n - 2]` is calculated as `n - 1 - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
