The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0].
   - `ans` is a list of length `n`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is 0.
   - If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * k`, where `k` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `2 * k - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.
   - Otherwise, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The last element of `preOne` is removed.
   - The length of `preOne` is reduced by 1.
   - The value of `preOne[-1]` (the last element of `preOne`) is no longer available in the list.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `preOne` now has one less element.
   - The value of `preOne[-1]` is updated to the second-to-last element of the original `preOne`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, but now it has one less element. `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0]. `ans` is a list of length `n`. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne`. `zr` is 0. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * k`, where `k` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `2 * k - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**
