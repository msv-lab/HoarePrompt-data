Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0. `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0]. `ans` is a list of length `n`. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne`. `zr` is 0. `zeroInd` is `2 * k`, where `k` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. `ans[n - 2]` is `2 * k - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans` at index `i` (which is `n - 2`) to the result of `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * k`, where `k` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- Therefore, `ans[n - 2]` is set to `2 * k - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.
- All other variables and their initial states remain unchanged.
