The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans` at index `i` with the result of `zeroInd - oneInd`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `i` is `n - 2`
- `zeroInd` is `n - 1`
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`

The value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`, which is `(n - 1) - (2 * preOne[-1])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0, n - 1]`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `(n - 1) - (2 * preOne[-1])`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0, n - 1]`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `(n - 1) - (2 * preOne[-1])`.**
