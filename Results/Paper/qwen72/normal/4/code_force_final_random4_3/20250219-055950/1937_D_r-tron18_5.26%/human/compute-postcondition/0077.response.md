Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 2 + n - 2`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[n - 3]` is `n - 2 + n - 2 - 2 * func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `n - 2 + n - 2`, which simplifies to `2 * (n - 2)`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- Therefore, `ans[n - 3]` becomes `2 * (n - 2) - 2 * func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`.
- The values of `el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
