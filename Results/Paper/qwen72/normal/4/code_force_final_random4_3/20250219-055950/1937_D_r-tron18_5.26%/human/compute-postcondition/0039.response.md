Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0. `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0]. `ans` is a list of length `n`. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne`. `zr` is 0. `zeroInd` is `2 * k`, where `k` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.** 

Explanation:
- The code assigns a value to `oneInd` based on the expression `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the list `preOne`, which is the cumulative sum of all elements in `pre`.
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` is a function call that, for the purpose of this task, we assume returns a specific value based on the input parameters.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
