Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.**

Explanation: The code snippet creates a list `pre` by iterating over the string `s1` and collecting the indices (1-based) of all characters that are '>'. The indices are calculated as `i + 1`, where `i` is the 0-based index of the character in `s1`. Therefore, `pre` will contain the positions of all '>' characters in `s1`. The initial state of `s1` and `n` remains unchanged.
