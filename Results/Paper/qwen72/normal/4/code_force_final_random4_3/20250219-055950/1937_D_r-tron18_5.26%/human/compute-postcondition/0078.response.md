To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables and how the functions `func_1` are used. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2].
   - `ans` is a list of length `n`.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is 1.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
   ```

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The variable `zeroInd` is calculated using the function `func_1` applied to the list `suffZero` and the values `ol + 1` and `1`.
   - The values of `suffZero`, `ol`, and `1` are used in the function calls.
   - The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so we will assume it is a function that returns a value based on the list and the index provided.

4. **Calculating `zeroInd`**:
   - `ol + 1` is `totalOne + 1`.
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the index `totalOne + 1`.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the index `1`.
   - `zeroInd` is then calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `el` remains the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`.
   - `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` remains a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
   - `totalOne` remains the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` remains a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` remains a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2].
   - `ans` remains a list of length `n`.
   - `i` remains `n - 3`.
   - `ol` remains `totalOne`.
   - `zr` remains 1.
   - `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.
