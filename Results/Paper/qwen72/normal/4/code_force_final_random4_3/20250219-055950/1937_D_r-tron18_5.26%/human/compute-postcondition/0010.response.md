To determine the output state, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0].
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `el` is the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`), and `el` is '>'.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is 0.
   - `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet is: `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
   - `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments: `suffZero` and `ol`.
   - `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0].
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.

3. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `suffZero` and `ol` as arguments.
   - The result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is multiplied by 2 and assigned to `zeroInd`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - Since `suffZero` is initially [0] and `ol` is `totalOne`, the function `func_1(suffZero, ol)` will depend on the implementation of `func_1`.
   - However, without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroInd`.
   - We can only say that `zeroInd` will be twice the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0].
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `el` is the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`), and `el` is '>'.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is 0.
   - `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.
   - `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
