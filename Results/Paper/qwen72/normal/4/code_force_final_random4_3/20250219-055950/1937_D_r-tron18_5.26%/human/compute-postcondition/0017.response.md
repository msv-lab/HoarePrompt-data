Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`), and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`**

Explanation:
- The code `fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` is executed.
- `zr` is 0, so `zr + 1` is 1.
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` returns the value at index 1 in the `preOne` list.
- `func_1(preOne, 0)` returns the value at index 0 in the `preOne` list.
- `fi` is assigned the value of `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated value of `fi`.
