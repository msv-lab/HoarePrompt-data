The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` within the range 0 to n-1, where `n` is the length of a permutation `p`. It prints a formatted query string `'? {a} {b} {c} {d}'` to the standard output and then reads a line of input from the standard input, returning it as a string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input string, which is the response to the printed query, is returned.
