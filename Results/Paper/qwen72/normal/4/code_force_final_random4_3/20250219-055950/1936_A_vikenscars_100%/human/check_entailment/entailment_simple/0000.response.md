### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make queries to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\) using the bitwise OR operation.
   - The goal is to find the maximum XOR value with at most \(3n\) queries.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` sends a query to the interactor and receives the comparison result.
   - The function is correctly implemented to send the query and receive the response.

3. **Function 2:**
   - The function starts by finding the index `max_item_idx` of the element that, when ORed with itself, is the largest among all elements.
   - This is done by comparing \((p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).

4. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
   - After finding `max_item_idx`, the function then tries to find a `pair_idx` such that \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \oplus p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \((p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}})\) with \((p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i)\) for all \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
   - If the result is `=`, it further compares \((p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) to break the tie.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop runs \(n-1\) times.
   - The second loop runs \(n\) times.
   - Total queries: \(n-1 + n = 2n - 1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` as the final answer.
   - The indices are valid and within the range \(0 \le i, j < n\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries and finds a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
