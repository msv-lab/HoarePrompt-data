Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<'. If `func_1` never returned '<', `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is equal to 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, and the current value of `ans1` is '<'.**

Explanation:
- The code `pair_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` to `pair_idx`.
- Since `i` is 0 in the initial state, `pair_idx` becomes 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `max_item_idx`, and `ans1`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<', and if `func_1` never returned '<', `max_item_idx` remains 0, is still valid.
- The value of `ans1` is still '<' as it is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.
