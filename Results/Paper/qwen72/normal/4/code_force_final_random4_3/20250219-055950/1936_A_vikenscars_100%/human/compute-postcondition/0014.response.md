Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<'. If `func_1` never returned '<', `max_item_idx` remains 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, which is the last value it takes in the range from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `max_item_idx` will hold the index of the last `i` for which the function `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned the string '<'. If the function `func_1` never returned '<' during any of the iterations, `max_item_idx` will remain 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state.
