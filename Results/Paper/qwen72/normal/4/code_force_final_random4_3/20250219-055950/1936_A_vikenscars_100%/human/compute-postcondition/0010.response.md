The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, which means the loop will iterate while `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4
- `i` is 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 3
- `n` must be greater than 3

The other variables (`ans` and `max_item_idx`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans` and `max_item_idx` remain unchanged**
