To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4
- `i` is `n-1`
- `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<'. If `func_1` never returned '<', `max_item_idx` remains 0.
- `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`

We need to adjust `i` to start from 0, as the loop will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `n` is already within the range that ensures the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<'. If `func_1` never returned '<', `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`**
