The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. The variable `max_item_idx` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `n` is already defined as an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, this condition ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, the initial state of `i` needs to be set to 1 for the first iteration, and `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is 0**
