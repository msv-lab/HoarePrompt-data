Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: `s` is an input binary string of length 1 to 500, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains the same, and `count` is the number of positions in `s` where adjacent characters are different. If `flag` is 0, it indicates that there does not exist any position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`. If `flag` is 1, it indicates that there exists at least one position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings `s` (where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), it calculates the number of positions where adjacent characters are different. If the string `s` does not contain any position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`, it prints the count of such positions plus one. Otherwise, it prints the count of such positions. The function does not return any value.
