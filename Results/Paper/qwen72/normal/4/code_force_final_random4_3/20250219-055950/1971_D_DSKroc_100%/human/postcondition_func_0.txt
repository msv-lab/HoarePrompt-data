The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings `s` (where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), it calculates the number of positions where adjacent characters are different. If the string `s` does not contain any position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`, it prints the count of such positions plus one. Otherwise, it prints the count of such positions. The function does not return any value.
