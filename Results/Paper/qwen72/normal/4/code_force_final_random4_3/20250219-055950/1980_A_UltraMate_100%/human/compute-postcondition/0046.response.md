Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is 'G'. `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `p`, which is 'ABCDEFG'.
- For each character `i` in `p`, the loop checks if `i` is not a key in `hmp` (the Counter object for the frequency of characters in `s`).
- If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`.
- After the loop completes all iterations, `i` will be 'G' (the last character in `p`).
- The variable `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in `hmp`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `hmp` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
