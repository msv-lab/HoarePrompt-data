The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A' to 'G'. It calculates the number of characters in the string 'ABCDEFG' that are either missing from `s` or appear fewer than `m` times, and prints this number for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the state of `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `ans` being undefined or reset for the next test case.
