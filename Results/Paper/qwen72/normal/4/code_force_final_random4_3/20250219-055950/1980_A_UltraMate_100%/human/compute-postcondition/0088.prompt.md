Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5, a is a string of n characters where each character is one of 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEFG'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`. `ans` is increased by the total of `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by the number of key-value pairs in `hmp`, and `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `_` is incremented by 7 for each key in `hmp`, `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m` plus the sum of (`m - hmp[i]`) for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` < `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
