Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Odd Dimensions:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This is because any cut parallel to one of the sides will result in at least one side of the smaller rectangles being non-integer. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. **Even Dimensions:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. The program then checks if the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.
   - The condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` checks if cutting the rectangle results in two identical smaller rectangles, which when rearranged, will form the same rectangle as the original. For example, if \(a = 4\) and \(b = 2\), cutting the rectangle into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles will not form a new rectangle. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed. This is because the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1: \(1 \times 1\)**
  - Both dimensions are odd. The program prints 'NO', which is correct.
- **Test Case 2: \(2 \times 1\)**
  - Both dimensions are not odd, but cutting the rectangle results in two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, which cannot form a new rectangle. The program prints 'NO', which is correct.
- **Test Case 3: \(2 \times 6\)**
  - Both dimensions are not odd, and cutting the rectangle results in two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, which can form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle. The program prints 'YES', which is correct.
- **Test Case 4: \(3 \times 2\)**
  - Both dimensions are not odd, and cutting the rectangle results in two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, which can form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle. The program prints 'YES', which is correct.
- **Test Case 5: \(2 \times 2\)**
  - Both dimensions are not odd, but cutting the rectangle results in two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, which cannot form a new rectangle. The program prints 'YES', which is incorrect. The correct output should be 'NO'.
- **Test Case 6: \(2 \times 4\)**
  - Both dimensions are not odd, and cutting the rectangle results in two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, which can form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle. The program prints 'YES', which is correct.
- **Test Case 7: \(6 \times 3\)**
  - Both dimensions are not odd, but cutting the rectangle results in two \(3 \times 3\) rectangles, which cannot form a new rectangle. The program prints 'NO', which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even and the resulting smaller rectangles are identical, which should result in 'NO' but the program prints 'YES'. Specifically, the test case \(2 \times 2\) is incorrectly handled.

Correctness: **False**
