Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input, and at least one of `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is exactly twice `b` or `b` is exactly twice `a`, this condition holds. Otherwise, `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`.***
