The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from user input. The function then checks if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly twice the other. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' for that test case. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that `n` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed for each test case.
