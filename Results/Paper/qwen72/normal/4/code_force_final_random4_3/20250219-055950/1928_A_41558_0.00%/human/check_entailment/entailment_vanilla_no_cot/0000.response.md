Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided has a logical error in its conditions. The problem is to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the one he starts with after cutting it into two smaller rectangles. The conditions in the program are not correctly capturing the logic required to solve this problem.

1. **First Condition**: `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:`

   This condition checks if both dimensions of the rectangle are odd. If they are, it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so the output "NO" is correct for this case.

2. **Second Condition**: `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`

   This condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other. However, this is not a valid condition to determine if another rectangle can be formed. For example, a 4x2 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 2x4 rectangle, which is the same as the original. This condition incorrectly prints "NO" for such cases.

3. **Third Condition**: `else:`

   This condition is supposed to handle all other cases, but it's not correctly capturing the logic. For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original. However, the program will print "YES" for this case, which is correct, but it will also print "YES" for cases where it should print "NO".

### Corrected Program:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and if these smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. The correct condition is to check if the product of the dimensions of the original rectangle can be expressed as the product of two different pairs of integers.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **First Condition**: `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:`

  If either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. These smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.

- **Second Condition**: `else:`

  If both dimensions are odd, it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so the output "NO" is correct.

This corrected program will correctly determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the one he starts with.
