Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition holds. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a` is exactly twice `b` or `b` is exactly twice `a`, this condition also holds. If neither of these conditions are met, `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`.***
