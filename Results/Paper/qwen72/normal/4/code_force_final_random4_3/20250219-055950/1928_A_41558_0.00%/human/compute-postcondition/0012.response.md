The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition holds. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a` is exactly twice `b` or `b` is exactly twice `a`, this condition also holds. If neither of these conditions are met, `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`.**
