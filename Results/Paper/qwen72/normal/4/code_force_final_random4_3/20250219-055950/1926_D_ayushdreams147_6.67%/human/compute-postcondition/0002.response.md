The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `a`. The loop will execute if the list `a` has at least one element. Given the initial state, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, which means `a` is guaranteed to have at least one element. Therefore, the loop will execute without needing to adjust `n` or `a`.

However, for the loop to start its first iteration, `num` should be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
