Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an element of `a` transformed by `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and the value is the count of how many times the original element appeared in `a` minus the number of times the transformed element appeared.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as the initial state, representing the length of the list `a`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The variable `res` is the count of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element.
- The dictionary `count` contains keys that are the transformed elements of `a` (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`), and the value for each key is the count of how many times the original element appeared in `a` minus the number of times the transformed element appeared. If an element and its transformed version both appear in `a`, the count for the transformed element will be adjusted accordingly.
