The code snippet `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value of `count[num]` by 1. Since `num` is the third element in the list `a`, the value of `num` is `a[2]`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, and `a` must have at least 3 elements. The value of `count[num]` is decreased by 1, but the specific value of `count[num]` before the decrement is not provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**
