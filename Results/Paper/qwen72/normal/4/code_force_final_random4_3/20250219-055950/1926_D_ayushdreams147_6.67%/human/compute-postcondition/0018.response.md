Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `num` is the third element in the list `a`. If `num` is not in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1 and `res` is increased by 1. If `num` is in `count`, then `count[num]` is decreased by 1.***
