Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element at the index `p - 1` in `l`, and `q` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 1).**
