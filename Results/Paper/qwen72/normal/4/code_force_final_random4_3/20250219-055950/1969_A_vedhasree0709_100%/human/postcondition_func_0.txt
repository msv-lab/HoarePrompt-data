The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then checks if there exists a pair of indices `i` and `p[i] - 1` such that `l[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such pair is found after checking all indices, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, `i` is either `n` or the value at which the loop broke, `j` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the loop broke due to the condition `q == i + 1`, and `l` is the last list of integers provided by the user.
