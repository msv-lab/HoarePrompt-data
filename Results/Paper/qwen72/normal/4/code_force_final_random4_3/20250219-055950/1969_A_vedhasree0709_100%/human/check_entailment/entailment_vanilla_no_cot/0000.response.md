Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the solution only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. However, it does not correctly handle cases where there are no such pairs but still a valid set of friends can be invited to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Pair Detection**: The solution correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. This is correct for the first test case in the example, where friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends.

2. **Default Case**: If no such pair is found, the solution prints `3`. This is not always correct. For example, in the second test case, the correct answer is `3`, but in the third test case, the correct answer is `2`, and the solution would print `3` incorrectly.

3. **General Case Handling**: The solution does not handle the general case where the minimum number of invitations might be more than 2 but less than 3. For example, if the input is `p = [2, 3, 1, 4]`, the correct answer is `2` (inviting friends 1 and 2), but the solution would print `3`.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:

- **Identify Pairs**: Check for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and print `2` if such a pair is found.
- **Identify Cycles**: If no such pairs are found, identify the smallest cycle in the friendship graph. The size of the smallest cycle will determine the minimum number of invitations needed.
- **Default Case**: If no cycles are found, the minimum number of invitations needed is `3`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        visited = [False] * n
        min_cycle_size = n + 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                j = i
                cycle_size = 0
                while not visited[j]:
                    visited[j] = True
                    j = l[j] - 1
                    cycle_size += 1
                if cycle_size < min_cycle_size:
                    min_cycle_size = cycle_size
        
        if min_cycle_size == 2:
            print(2)
        elif min_cycle_size == n:
            print(3)
        else:
            print(min_cycle_size)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the smallest cycle in the friendship graph and prints the minimum number of invitations needed. If the smallest cycle is of size 2, it prints `2`. If the smallest cycle is the entire set of friends (i.e., a cycle of size `n`), it prints `3`. Otherwise, it prints the size of the smallest cycle.
