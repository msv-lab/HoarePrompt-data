Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `p` is the first element of `l`.
   - `q` is the element at the index `p - 1` in `l`.
   - `q` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 1).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(2)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The value 2 is a constant integer and will be printed as is.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the integer 2.

Output: **2**
