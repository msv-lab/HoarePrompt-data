Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `p` is now equal to the value at index 2 of `l`, `q` is now equal to the integer at the index `p - 1` in the list `l`, `j` remains 0 unless `q` == 2, in which case `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
