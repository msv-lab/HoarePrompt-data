#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided through standard input or a similar mechanism. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1; the next n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge in the tree; and the last line containing a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: `total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing `n-1` elements, each element is a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the last valid input line, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the loop.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains `n-1` elements, each element being a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, expecting a series of lines where each line (except the last) contains two integers representing an edge in a tree. It continues reading until a line does not contain exactly two integers. The function then returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing an edge in the tree. The final state of the program is that the list `numbers` contains `n-1` elements, each element being a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree, and the input reading process has concluded.
