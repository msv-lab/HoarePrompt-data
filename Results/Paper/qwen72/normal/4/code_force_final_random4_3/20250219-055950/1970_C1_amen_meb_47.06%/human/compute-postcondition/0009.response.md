For the given `while True:` loop, the loop condition is always `True` and does not depend on any specific variables or conditions to proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing a single element which is a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
