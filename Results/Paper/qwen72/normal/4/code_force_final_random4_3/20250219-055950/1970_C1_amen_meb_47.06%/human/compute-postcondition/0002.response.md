Output State: **`total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input.**

The initial state variables `total`, `func_1`, and `numbers` remain unchanged. The code snippet `nums = input().split()` reads the first line of input, which contains two integers `n` and `t`, and splits this line into a list of strings. Therefore, `nums` now holds these two integers as strings.
