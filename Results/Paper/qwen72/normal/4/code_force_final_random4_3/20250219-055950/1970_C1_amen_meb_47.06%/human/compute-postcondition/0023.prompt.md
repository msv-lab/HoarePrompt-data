Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided through standard input or a similar mechanism. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1; the next n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge in the tree; and the last line containing a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `numbers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing a single element which is a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing two elements, the first element is a list `[num1, num2]` and the second element is also a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing three elements, the first and second elements are lists `[num1, num2]`, and the third element is also a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
