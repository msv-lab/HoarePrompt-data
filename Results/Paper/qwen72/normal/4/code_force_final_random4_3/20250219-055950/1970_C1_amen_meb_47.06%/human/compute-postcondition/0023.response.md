Output State: **`total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing `n-1` elements, each element is a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the last valid input line, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`total`**: The variable `total` is not modified within the loop, so it remains 0.
- **`func_1`**: The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, and this remains unchanged.
- **`numbers`**: After all iterations, `numbers` will contain `n-1` elements, each of which is a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree. This is because the loop continues to append pairs of integers to `numbers` until it encounters a line that does not contain exactly two integers.
- **`nums`**: `nums` will be the list of strings representing the integers from the last valid input line that contained exactly two integers.
- **`num1` and `num2`**: These variables will hold the integer values of the last valid input line that contained exactly two integers. If the last input line does not contain exactly two integers, the loop breaks, and these variables will retain the values from the previous valid iteration.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop will break when it encounters a line that does not contain exactly two integers, which is expected to be the line containing the starting node `u_1`.
