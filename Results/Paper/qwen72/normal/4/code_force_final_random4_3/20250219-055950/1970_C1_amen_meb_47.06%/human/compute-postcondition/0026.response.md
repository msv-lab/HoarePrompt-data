Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, expecting a series of lines where each line (except the last) contains two integers representing an edge in a tree. It continues reading until a line does not contain exactly two integers. The function then returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing an edge in the tree. The final state of the program is that the list `numbers` contains `n-1` elements, each element being a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree, and the input reading process has concluded. **
