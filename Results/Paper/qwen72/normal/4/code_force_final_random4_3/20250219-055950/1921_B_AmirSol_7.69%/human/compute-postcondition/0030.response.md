Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The loop has completed its execution, so `i` is equal to `n`. The `counter` variable holds the number of positions in the strings `s1` and `s2` where the characters differ, and for each such position, if the next position (if it exists) also differs and the characters in `s1` at these two positions are different, then the `counter` is incremented by 1 for both positions, otherwise, the `counter` is incremented by 1 for each differing position.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning that the loop has processed all characters in the strings `s1` and `s2`. The `counter` will contain the count of differing positions between `s1` and `s2`, with a special rule applied: if two consecutive differing positions in `s1` and `s2` have different characters in `s1`, they are counted as a single difference. Otherwise, each differing position is counted individually.
