The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `counter` is increased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, this condition is still valid after the increment. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `counter` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1.**
