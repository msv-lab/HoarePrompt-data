Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`, then `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 1.***
