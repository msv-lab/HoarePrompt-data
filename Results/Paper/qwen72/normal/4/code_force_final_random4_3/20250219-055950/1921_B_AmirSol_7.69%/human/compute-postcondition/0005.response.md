Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 1, `i` is 0, the characters at the 0th index of `s1` and `s2` are not equal (s1[0] != s2[0]), `i` is less than `n - 1`, the characters at the (i + 1)th index of `s1` and `s2` are not equal (s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]), and the characters at the `i`th index of `s1` and the (i + 1)th index of `s1` are not equal (s1[i] != s1[i + 1]).**
