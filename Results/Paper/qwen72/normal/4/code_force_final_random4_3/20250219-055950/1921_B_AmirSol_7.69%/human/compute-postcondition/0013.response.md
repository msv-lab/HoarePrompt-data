Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. If `s1[0] != s2[0]`, then `counter` is 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is 2, then `i` is less than `n - 1`, `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`. If `s1[0] == s2[0]`, then `counter` is 0 and `i` is 1, and the characters at index `i-1` in `s1` and `s2` are the same.***
