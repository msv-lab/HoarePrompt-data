Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It returns an integer `counter` which represents the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ. For each pair of consecutive differing positions where the characters in `s1` at these two positions are different, the `counter` is incremented by 1 for both positions, otherwise, it is incremented by 1 for each differing position. After the function concludes, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged, and `counter` holds the final result. **
