The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `counter` is increased by 1.**
