Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 1, `i` is 0, and the characters at the 0th index of `s1` and `s2` are not equal (s1[0] != s2[0]). Additionally, either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`.**
