Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` + 2, `counter` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 2.** 

In natural language: The value of `i` is increased by 2, and the value of `counter` is increased by 1. The length of the strings `s1` and `s2` remains `n`, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
