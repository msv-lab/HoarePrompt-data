To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is now 0.
   - `n` is the last integer value of `data` that was used to determine the length of the list `a` in the final iteration.
   - `a` is the last list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data`.
   - `idx` is now `2 + t_initial * n_final` where `t_initial` is the initial value of `t` and `n_final` is the number of integers processed in the final iteration.
   - `results` is a list containing `t_initial` elements, each element being the value returned by `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t_initial` is the initial value of `t`, which is 0.
   - `n_final` is the number of integers processed in the final iteration, which is the same as `n`.
   - `results` is a list containing 0 elements because `t_initial` is 0.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

4. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is trying to join the elements of the `results` list with a newline character and print the resulting string.
   - Since `results` is an empty list (as `t_initial` is 0), joining an empty list with any delimiter will result in an empty string.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print an empty string.

Output: **(an empty string)**
