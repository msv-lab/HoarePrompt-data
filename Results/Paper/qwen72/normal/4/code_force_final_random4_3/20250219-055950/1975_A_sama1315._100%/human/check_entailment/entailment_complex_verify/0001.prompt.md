You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all elements a_i in a.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: `a` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all elements a_i in a; `n` is equal to the length of `a` and must be at least 2; `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` in ascending order; `concatenated_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` repeated twice; `i` is `n - 1`. If the subsequence of `concatenated_a` from index `i` to `i + len(sorted_a)` is equal to `sorted_a`, the program returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, the loop completes without returning 'Yes'.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers (where the length of `a` is between 2 and 50, and each element is between 1 and 1,000,000). It returns 'Yes' if the list `a` can be cyclically shifted to form a sorted list. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: - The `print` statement will print an empty string.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` integers into a list `a`. It then calls `func_1` with the list `a` for each test case and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `n` is the last integer used to determine the length of the list `a` in the final iteration, `a` is the last list of `n` integers, `idx` is the index after processing all integers, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and need to determine if it can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping them.
   - The operation can be repeated any number of times.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If we can split the array into two parts such that the suffix followed by the prefix forms a sorted array, then the array can be sorted using the operation.
   - This means that there should be a point in the array where the elements from that point to the end, followed by the elements from the beginning to that point, form a sorted array.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(a)` takes an array `a` and checks if it can be sorted by the described operation.
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to create `concatenated_a`.
   - It iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. By concatenating the array with itself, we can check all possible splits of the array.
   - If any subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, it means that the array can be sorted by the described operation.

6. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
