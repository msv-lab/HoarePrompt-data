Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate, and the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them). Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - **Sorting and Concatenation**:
     - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This step is crucial because it allows us to check all possible cyclic shifts of the array `a`.
   - **Subarray Check**:
     - The function iterates over the first `n` positions of `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` starting from position `i` is equal to `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the specified operation.
     - If no such subarray is found after checking all possible positions, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - The function reads the entire input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
     - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - **Test Case Processing**:
     - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the list of integers `a`.
     - It calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and collects the results in a list `results`.
   - **Output**:
     - It prints each result on a new line, which matches the required output format.

The logic in `func_1` is sound because:
- If an array can be split into two parts and swapped to become sorted, the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.
- By checking all possible contiguous subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a`, the function ensures that it covers all possible cyclic shifts of the array `a`.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, including:
- Arrays that are already sorted.
- Arrays that cannot be sorted by any cyclic shift.
- Multiple test cases with varying lengths and values.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
