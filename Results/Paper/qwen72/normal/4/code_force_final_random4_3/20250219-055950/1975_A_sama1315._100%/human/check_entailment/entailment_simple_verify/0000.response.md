Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - The function checks if any contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of the original array `a`) is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the specified operation.
   - If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

   **Correctness of `func_1(a)`**:
   - The key insight is that if an array can be split into two parts and swapped to become sorted, the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.
   - This is because the operation of splitting and swapping can be thought of as a circular shift of the array. If a circular shift of the array results in a sorted array, then the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subarray in `a + a`.
   - The function correctly checks all possible contiguous subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to see if any of them match `sorted_a`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

   **Correctness of `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly initializes the index `idx` and processes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results in the required format, with each result on a new line.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. The logic in `func_1` is sound and the input parsing in `func_2` is accurate.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
