Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is now equal to the integer value of `data[1]`.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
