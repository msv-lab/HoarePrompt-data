Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is now `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data` starting from index `3 + n` and ending at `3 + 2*n - 1`.**

The code snippet `result = func_1(a)` updates the variable `result` to the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the list `a`. The list `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, and each integer in `a` is between 1 and 1,000,000. The variable `results` is a list that already contains the value returned by `func_1(a)`, and this list is not modified by the code snippet. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `idx`) remain unchanged.
