Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`, `idx` is now `4 + 3*n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data` starting from index `4 + 2*n` and ending at `4 + 2*n + n - 1`, `results` contains the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = func_1(a)` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `idx`, or the list `a`.
- The variable `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(a)`.
- The list `results` already contains the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the value of `result`, so it remains unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `result` is explicitly stated to be the value returned by `func_1(a)`.
