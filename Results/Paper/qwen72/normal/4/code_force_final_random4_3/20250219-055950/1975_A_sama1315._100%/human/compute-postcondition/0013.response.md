The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter for the `range(t)` loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and the loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked, we can infer that the loop has executed once, so `t` must now be `t - 1` for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `result`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is now `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
