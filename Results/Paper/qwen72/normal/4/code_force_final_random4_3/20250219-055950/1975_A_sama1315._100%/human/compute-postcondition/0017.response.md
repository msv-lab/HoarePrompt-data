Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is now `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data` starting from index `3 + n` and ending at `3 + 2*n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `idx` was initially `3 + n`.
- The code `idx += n` increments `idx` by `n`.
- Therefore, `idx` is now `3 + n + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 2*n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
