Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be transformed into a non-decreasing sorted array by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - It concatenates the array `a` with itself to handle the circular nature of the problem.
   - It then checks if any subarray of length `n` in the concatenated array is equal to the sorted version of the original array `a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly handles the problem requirements. The input parsing and test case handling in `func_2` are also implemented correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
