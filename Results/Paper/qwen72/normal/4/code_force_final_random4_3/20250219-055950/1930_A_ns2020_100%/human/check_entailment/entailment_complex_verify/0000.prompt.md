You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function should return a list of integers representing the maximum final score for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `A` is a list of integers in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. It sorts the list and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and the state of `n` and `A` is undefined as they are reinitialized for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading and Sorting the Array**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A`.
3. **Calculating the Score**: The program calculates the maximum score by summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`. This is correct because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the even indices when pairs are formed. By summing these elements, the program ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- **Single Test Case**: The program works for a single test case.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
- **Small and Large Values of n**: The program works for both small and large values of `n` within the given constraints.
- **Various Integer Values**: The program correctly handles various integer values within the given constraints.

Since the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
