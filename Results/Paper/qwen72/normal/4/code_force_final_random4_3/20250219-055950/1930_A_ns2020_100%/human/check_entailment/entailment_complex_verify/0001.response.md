### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by performing `n` moves on a list of `2n` integers. Each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and erasing them.
   - The goal is to ensure that the sum of the minimum values selected in each move is maximized.

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer.
   - This ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible, which maximizes the score.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Sort the array of integers in ascending order.
   - The sorted array will have the smallest numbers at the beginning.
   - By summing every second element starting from the first (i.e., the smallest elements), we can achieve the maximum score.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A`.
   - It prints the sum of every second element starting from the first, which is `sum(A[::2])`.
   - The loop `while t` ensures that the program processes all test cases.

5. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - **State of the program right before the function call**: The function `func` is designed to read inputs directly from the user, which is consistent with the problem's input format.
   - **Reading `t`**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - **Reading `n`**: For each test case, the program correctly reads the number of pairs.
   - **Reading `A`**: The program correctly reads the list of `2n` integers.
   - **Sorting `A`**: The program sorts the list `A` in ascending order, which is necessary for the optimal solution.
   - **Summing every second element**: The program sums every second element starting from the first, which is the correct approach to maximize the score.
   - **Decrementing `t`**: The program correctly decrements `t` after processing each test case, ensuring that all test cases are processed.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
   - The program correctly sums every second element starting from the first, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.
   - The program does not return any value, but it prints the results, which is consistent with the problem's output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the maximum final score for each test case as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
