The code `A.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. Since `A` is already specified as a list of integers in ascending order, the sorting operation will not change the order of the elements in `A`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 4998, `n` is the input integer, `A` is a list of integers in ascending order.**
