Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 4998.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `A` is a list of integers in ascending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `A`**: The list `A` is described as being in ascending order. This means the elements of `A` are sorted from smallest to largest.
2. **Slicing `A[::2]`**: The slicing operation `A[::2]` selects every second element from the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0). For example, if `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A[::2]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`.
3. **Sum of Sliced Elements**: The `sum` function calculates the sum of the elements in the sliced list `A[::2]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sum of every second element in the list `A`, starting from the first element.

Since the exact values of the elements in `A` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `A`.

Output: **sum of every second element in the list `A` (starting from the first element)**

This means the output will be the sum of the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, etc., of the list `A`.
