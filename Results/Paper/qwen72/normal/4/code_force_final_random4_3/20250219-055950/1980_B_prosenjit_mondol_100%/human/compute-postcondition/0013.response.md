Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `f` is the second integer from the input minus 1.
- `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order.
- `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`.
- `a[k]` is equal to `x`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a` and `x`**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`.

2. **Understanding `k` and `a[k]`**:
   - `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1.
   - `a[k]` is equal to `x`.

3. **Condition in the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement checks two conditions:
     - `k == n - 1`
     - `a[k + 1] < x`

4. **Evaluating the Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1: `k == n - 1`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `n - 1`, it means `k` is the last index of the list `a`.
     - In this case, the condition `k == n - 1` will be true, and the print statement will output 'YES'.
   - **Condition 2: `a[k + 1] < x`**:
     - If `k` is not the last index, the condition `a[k + 1] < x` will be checked.
     - Since `a` is sorted in descending order, `a[k]` is greater than or equal to `a[k + 1]`.
     - Given that `a[k] == x`, the condition `a[k + 1] < x` will be true if `a[k + 1]` is strictly less than `x`.

### Conclusion:
- If `k` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `k == n - 1`), the print statement will output 'YES'.
- If `k` is not the last index and `a[k + 1]` is strictly less than `x`, the print statement will output 'YES'.
- If neither of these conditions is met, the print statement will output 'MAYBE'.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' if `k` is the last index of the list `a` or `a[k + 1]` is strictly less than `x`, otherwise 'MAYBE'**.
