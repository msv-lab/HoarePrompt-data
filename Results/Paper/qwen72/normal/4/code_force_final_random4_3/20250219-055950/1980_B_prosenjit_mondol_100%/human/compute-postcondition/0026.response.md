Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers from the new input sorted in descending order, `x` is equal to `a[f]` after sorting. If `a[k]` < `x`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.***
