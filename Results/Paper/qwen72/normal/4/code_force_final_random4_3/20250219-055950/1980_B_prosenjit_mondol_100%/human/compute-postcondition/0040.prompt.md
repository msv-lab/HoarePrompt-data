Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, each test case consists of n, f, and k as integers where 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then `a[k]` is less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers from the new input sorted in descending order, `x` is equal to `a[f]` after sorting. If `a[k]` > `x`, the condition holds. If `a[k]` < `x`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 3, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 3, `a` is a list of integers from the new input sorted in descending order, and `x` is equal to `a[f]` after sorting. If `a[k]` > `a[f]`, the condition holds. If `a[k]` < `a[f]`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
