Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the current value of `a[k]` is less than `x`.**
