Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 3, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 3, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `x` is equal to `a[f]` after sorting. If `a[k]` > `x`, the condition holds. If `a[k]` < `x`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `a` to a list of integers from the new input.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is still equal to `a[f]` after sorting `a` in descending order.
- The condition regarding `a[k]` and `x` remains the same as in the initial state.
