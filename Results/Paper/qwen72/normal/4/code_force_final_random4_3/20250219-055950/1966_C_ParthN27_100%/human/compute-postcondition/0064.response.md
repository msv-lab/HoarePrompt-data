Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended. If the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if the difference is less than or equal to 1, `ans` is 0.***
