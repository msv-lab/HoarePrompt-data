The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop**
