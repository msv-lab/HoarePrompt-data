Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the length of `s`. The other variables `i`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Since `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order with 0 prepended at the beginning, the new value of `n` is the number of unique elements in `arr` plus one (for the 0). The value of `i` is still `n-1`, which now refers to the new value of `n`.
