The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is set by the loop and starts at 0. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is an empty set**
