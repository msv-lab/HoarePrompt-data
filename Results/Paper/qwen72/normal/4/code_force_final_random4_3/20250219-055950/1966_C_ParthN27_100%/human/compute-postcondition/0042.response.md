Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` is now equal to the user input integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is 2, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning, and `ans` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2 and the difference between all pairs of consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2` is at most 1, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, which is now updated to the specific list of integers input by the user.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
