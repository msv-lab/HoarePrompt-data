Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `n` must be at least as large as the length of the list `arr`. The loop variable `i` will be one less than `n`, which is the last index of `arr` that was processed. The set `s` will contain all the unique elements from the list `arr`, and `arr` itself remains unchanged as it was in the initial state.
