Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` indicates whether there are differences between consecutive elements in `s`: if `ans` is 1, there are differences; if `ans` is 0, there are no differences.***
