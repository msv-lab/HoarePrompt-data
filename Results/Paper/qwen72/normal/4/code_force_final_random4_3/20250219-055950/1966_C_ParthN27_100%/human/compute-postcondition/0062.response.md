Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1` (but will be redefined by the loop), `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1***
