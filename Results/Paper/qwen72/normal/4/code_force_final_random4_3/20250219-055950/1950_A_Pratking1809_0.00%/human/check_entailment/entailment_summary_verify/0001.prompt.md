You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `q` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes `q` as the number of test cases processed, `i` as `q-1` (the last index of the loop), and `mn` remains 100. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `q` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - For each test case, the program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - It then checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program correctly uses the `map` function to convert the input strings to integers.
   - The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are logically correct for identifying stairs and peaks, respectively.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should result in "NONE".
   - It also handles cases where the digits are in different orders, ensuring the correct output is printed.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:
- The `else` statement is not properly indented to ensure it only executes when neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true. As it stands, the `else` block will execute even if the first condition is true, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this, the `else` statement should be aligned with the second `if` statement:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle all test cases.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect `else` block indentation)
