The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9). It returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not described.**
