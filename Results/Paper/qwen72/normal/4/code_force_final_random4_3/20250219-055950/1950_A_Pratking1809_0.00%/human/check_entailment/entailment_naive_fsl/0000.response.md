Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program has a logical error in the way it checks the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK". The issue arises because both conditions are checked using separate `if` statements, which means that if both conditions are true (e.g., `a < b < c` and `a < b > c`), the program will print both "STAIR" and "PEAK" for the same test case, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 2 2
```
The program will incorrectly print "STAIR" and "PEAK" for this input, whereas it should only print "NONE" since the digits do not form a strict stair or peak.

To fix this, the conditions should be checked using `elif` to ensure that only one condition is evaluated at a time, and the `else` clause should handle the "NONE" case. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```
