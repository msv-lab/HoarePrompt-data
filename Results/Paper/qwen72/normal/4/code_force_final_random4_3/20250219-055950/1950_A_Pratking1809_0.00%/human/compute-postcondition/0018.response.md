Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mn` is 100, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` holds true. Otherwise, if `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true. If neither `a < b > c` nor `a < b < c` holds true, then neither condition is satisfied.***
