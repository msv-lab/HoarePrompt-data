Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `q` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `mn` is 100.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
- The conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` are:
  - If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true.
  - Otherwise, if `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` holds true.
  - If neither `a < b > c` nor `a < b < c` holds true, then neither condition is satisfied.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```
print('NONE')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`**:
   - The code snippet does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` or any of the conditions involving them.
   - The conditions are only used to determine the logic flow in the program, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

2. **Output of the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NONE'`.
   - The string `'NONE'` is a constant and does not change based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` or any other variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` or any other variables.

Output: **NONE**
