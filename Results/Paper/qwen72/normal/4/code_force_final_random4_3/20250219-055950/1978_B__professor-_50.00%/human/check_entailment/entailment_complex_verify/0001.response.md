### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling at the modified price would not increase the profit.
     - The program correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is \(\frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).
     - The program correctly prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\) in this case.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\).
     - However, the program incorrectly prints \(\frac{(b - a) / 2 \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n}\). The division \((b - a) / 2\) should be integer division \((b - a) // 2\) to ensure the result is an integer, and the formula should be \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))\).

3. **Arithmetic and Integer Division**:
   - The program uses integer division (`int()`) to ensure that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements.
   - However, the formula in the third case is incorrect due to the division operation and the incorrect calculation of the remaining profit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the first two cases but has an error in the third case. The formula for the third case should be \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            print(int((k * (k + 1)) // 2 + a * (n - k)))
```

This corrected code ensures that the third case is handled correctly by using integer division and the correct formula for the profit from the first `k` buns and the remaining buns.
