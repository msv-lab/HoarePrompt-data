Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- If `b <= a`, the condition `b <= a` holds true.
- If `b > a`, the condition `b > a` holds true.
- If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds true.
- Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `b - a`**:
   - If `b <= a`, then `b - a` is a non-positive integer (0 or negative).
   - If `b > a`, then `b - a` is a positive integer.

2. **Evaluate the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`**:
   - This expression is a formula for the sum of the first `b - a` integers. The sum of the first `k` integers is given by \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
   - If `b <= a`, then `b - a` is non-positive, and the expression will evaluate to 0 because the sum of the first 0 or negative integers is 0.
   - If `b > a`, then `b - a` is positive, and the expression will evaluate to the sum of the first `b - a` integers.

3. **Evaluate the expression `a * n`**:
   - This is simply the product of `a` and `n`.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - The final expression is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
   - If `b <= a`, the expression simplifies to `int(0 + a * n)`, which is `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the expression simplifies to `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

5. **Consider the conditions**:
   - If `b - a >= n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`.
   - If `b - a < n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

### Final Output:
- If `b <= a`, the output will be `a * n`.
- If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the output will be `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
- If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the output will be `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

### Summary:
The `print` statement will output an integer value based on the conditions provided. The value will be:
- `a * n` if `b <= a`.
- `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` if `b > a`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * n (if b <= a) or int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (if b > a)**
