### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - **Case 1**: `b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `n * a`.
     - This condition is correctly handled and the output is correct.
   - **Case 2**: `b > a` and `b - a >= n`
     - If the modified price `b` is greater than the usual price `a` and the difference `b - a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
     - This condition is correctly handled and the output is correct.
   - **Case 3**: `b > a` and `b - a < n`
     - If the modified price `b` is greater than the usual price `a` but the difference `b - a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.
     - The formula used is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`, but there is a mistake here. The correct formula should be `int((b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a)))`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the correct behavior.

### Correctness:
- The first two conditions are handled correctly.
- The third condition has a mistake in the formula. The correct formula should be `int((b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a)))`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the mistake in the formula for the third condition.
