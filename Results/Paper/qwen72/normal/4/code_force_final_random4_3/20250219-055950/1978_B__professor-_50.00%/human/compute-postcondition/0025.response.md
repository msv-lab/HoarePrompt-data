Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. If `b <= a`, the condition `b <= a` holds true. If `b > a`, the condition `b > a` holds true. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `b - a < n` holds true.***
