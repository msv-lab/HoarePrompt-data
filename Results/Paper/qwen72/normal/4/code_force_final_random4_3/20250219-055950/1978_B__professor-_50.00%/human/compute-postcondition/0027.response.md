The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. All parameters are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output conditions are not provided in the example. Therefore, I will assume the function returns a value based on some relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
