Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds true. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds true, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds true. Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**
