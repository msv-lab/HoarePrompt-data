### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling at the modified price would not increase the profit.
     - The program correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is \(\frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).
     - The program correctly prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\) in this case.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\).
     - The program prints \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\), but there is a mistake in the formula. The correct formula should be \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \times a\).

3. **Arithmetic and Integer Division**:
   - The program uses integer division (`int()`) to ensure that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements.

### Detailed Analysis of Case 3:
- The correct formula for the profit in Case 3 should be:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \times a
  \]
- The program currently prints:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n
  \]
- This is incorrect because it adds the entire `a * n` to the profit from the first `b - a` buns, which results in an overcounting of the profit from the remaining buns.

### Example Verification:
- For the test case `10 10 5`:
  - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Since `b - a < n`, we should use the formula for Case 3.
  - Correct profit: \(\frac{(5 - 10) \times (5 - 10 + 1)}{2} + (10 - (5 - 10)) \times 10 = \frac{(-5) \times (-4)}{2} + (10 - (-5)) \times 10 = \frac{20}{2} + 15 \times 10 = 10 + 150 = 160\)
  - Program output: \(\frac{(5 - 10) \times (5 - 10 + 1)}{2} + 10 \times 10 = \frac{(-5) \times (-4)}{2} + 100 = 10 + 100 = 110\)

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the mistake in the formula for Case 3. The correct formula should be \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \times a\).

### Correctness:
