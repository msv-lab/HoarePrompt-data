Output State: **`t` is 0, and the loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `n`, `a`, and `b` were input integers. If `b <= a`, the condition `b <= a` held true, and `n * a` was printed. If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the condition `b - a >= n` held true, and `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` was printed. If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the condition `b - a < n` held true, and `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` was printed.**

In natural language: The loop has completed all its iterations, and `t` is now 0. For each of the `t` iterations, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` were provided as input integers. Depending on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, one of three conditions was checked, and the corresponding output was printed. Specifically:
- If `b` was less than or equal to `a`, the product `n * a` was printed.
- If `b` was greater than `a` and the difference `b - a` was greater than or equal to `n`, the value `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` was printed.
- If `b` was greater than `a` and the difference `b - a` was less than `n`, the value `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` was printed.
