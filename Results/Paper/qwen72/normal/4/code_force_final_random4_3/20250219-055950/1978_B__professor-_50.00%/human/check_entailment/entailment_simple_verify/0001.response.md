### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling at the modified price would not increase the profit.
     - The program correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is \(\frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).
     - The program correctly prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\) in this case.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\).
     - The program prints \(\frac{(b - a) / 2 \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n}\), but this formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))\).

3. **Arithmetic and Integer Division**:
   - The program uses integer division (`int()`) to ensure that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements.

### Detailed Analysis of Case 3:
- The original formula in the program is:
  \[
  \text{profit} = \int\left(\frac{(b - a)}{2} \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n\right)
  \]
- The correct formula should be:
  \[
  \text{profit} = \int\left(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))\right)
  \]
- The error in the program is in the term \(\frac{(b - a)}{2} \times (b - a + 1)\). This should be \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\) to correctly compute the sum of the arithmetic series.

### Example Verification:
- For the input `10 10 5`:
  - The program should choose `k = 0` and print `100`.
  - The program correctly prints `100` because `b <= a` is true.
- For the input `5 5 11`:
  - The program should choose `k = 5` and print `45`.
  - The program correctly prints `45` because `b - a >= n` is true.
- For the input `10 10 5`:
  - The program should choose `k = 5` and print `500500`.
  - The program prints `500500` because it uses the incorrect formula in Case 3.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the error in the formula used in Case 3. The correct formula should be:
\[
\text{profit} = \int\left(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))\right)
\]
