Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet, we note this for completeness).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate the difference `b - a`**:
   - Since `b` is greater than `a`, `b - a` is a positive integer.
   - Let's denote this difference as `d`. So, `d = b - a`.

2. **Calculate the first part of the expression: `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`**:
   - This can be rewritten as `d / 2 * (d + 1)`.
   - Since `d` is an integer, `d / 2` will be a floating-point number. However, when multiplied by `(d + 1)`, the result will be a floating-point number.

3. **Calculate the second part of the expression: `a * n`**:
   - This is simply the product of `a` and `n`.

4. **Combine the two parts**:
   - The expression becomes `int(d / 2 * (d + 1) + a * n)`.
   - The `int` function will convert the result to an integer by truncating the decimal part.

### Final Expression:
- The final expression is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

### Explanation:
- The term `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` is a formula that calculates the sum of the first `d` natural numbers, where `d = b - a`.
- The term `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`.
- The sum of these two terms is then converted to an integer.

### Output:
- The output will be an integer value calculated by the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given formula and conditions.

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where `b - a` is the difference between `b` and `a`, and `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`)**
