The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it seems to accept parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.

However, since the function body and the output are not provided, we can only infer the expected functionality based on the parameters. Typically, such a function might perform some operation involving `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18). The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
