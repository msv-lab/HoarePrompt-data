Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integer 0, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0.**
