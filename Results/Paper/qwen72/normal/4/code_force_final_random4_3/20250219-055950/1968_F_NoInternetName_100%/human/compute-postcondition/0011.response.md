The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second element of `a`, which means the next iteration will use the third element of `a`.

Given that `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 2 elements, and the current state indicates that `i` is the second element of `a`, the next state will be:

- `i` is the third element of `a`.
- The list `a` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and the result of `1 ^ a[1]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[1]` containing the integer 1, and `inds[1 ^ a[1]]` containing the integers 1 and 2, `i` is the third element of `a`.**
