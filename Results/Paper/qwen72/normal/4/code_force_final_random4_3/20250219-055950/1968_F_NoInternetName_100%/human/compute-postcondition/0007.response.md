Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` that must have at least 1 element, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and `i`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `i` is the first element of `a`, `inds[i]` now contains the integer 1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`.
- `x[-1]` is the last element of `x`, which is `i`.
- `len(x) - 1` is the length of `x` minus 1. Since `x` contains the integers 0 and `i`, its length is 2, so `len(x) - 1` is 1.
- Therefore, `inds[i]` is updated to include the integer 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
