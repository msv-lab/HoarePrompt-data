The code snippet `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` updates the `inds` dictionary by appending the index of the last element in `x` to the list corresponding to the key `x[-1]`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30.
   - `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`.
   - `x` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, the result of `1 ^ a[1]`, and the result of `x[-1] ^ a[2]`.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[1]` containing the integer 1, and `inds[1 ^ a[1]]` containing the integers 1 and 2.
   - `i` is the third element of `a`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code appends the index of the last element in `x` to the list in `inds` corresponding to the key `x[-1]`.

3. **Check Previous Values:**
   - `x` contains 0, 1, `1 ^ a[1]`, and `x[-1] ^ a[2]`.
   - `x[-1]` is the last element of `x`, which is `x[-1] ^ a[2]`.
   - `len(x)` is 4, so `len(x) - 1` is 3.

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   - `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends 3 to the list in `inds` corresponding to the key `x[-1]`.
   - The key `x[-1]` is `x[-1] ^ a[2]`.

5. **Update the Variables:**
   - `inds[x[-1]]` now contains the integers 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, the result of `1 ^ a[1]`, and the result of `x[-1] ^ a[2]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[1]` containing the integer 1, `inds[1 ^ a[1]]` containing the integers 1 and 2, and `inds[x[-1]]` containing the integers 1, 2, and 3, `i` is the third element of `a`.**
