The code snippet `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends a new value to the list `x`. The new value is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the first element of `a` (which is `i`).

- `x` initially contains the integer 0.
- `i` is the first element of `a`.
- The last element of `x` is 0 (since `x` starts with a single element, 0).
- The new value appended to `x` is `0 ^ i`, which is simply `i` because `0 ^ any_number` equals `any_number`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the list `x` will contain two elements: 0 and `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` that must have at least 1 element, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and `i`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `i` is the first element of `a`.**
