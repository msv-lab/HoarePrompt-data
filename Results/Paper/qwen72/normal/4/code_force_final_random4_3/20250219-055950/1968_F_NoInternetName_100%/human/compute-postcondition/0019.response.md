Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears.
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - The value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the value of `x[r]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.
   - The initial state provides context but does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
   - The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is given, but it does not influence the `print` statement itself.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`, or `inds`.

Output: **Yes**
