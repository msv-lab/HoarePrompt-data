Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
2. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index.
4. `inds` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears.
5. `i` is incremented by 1.
6. `q` is greater than the new value of `i`.
7. `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
8. `lower` is the smallest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists.
9. `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, or `upper`.

Output: **Yes**
