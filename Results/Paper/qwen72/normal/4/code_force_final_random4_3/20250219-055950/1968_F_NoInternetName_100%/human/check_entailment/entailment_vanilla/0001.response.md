### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input using `func_1(int)` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q` using `func_1(int)`, and then reads the array `a` using `func_1(int)`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `x` with a single element `0` to store the prefix XOR values.
   - It iterates through the array `a`, computing the prefix XOR for each element and appending it to `x`.
   - This step is crucial for efficiently answering the queries. The prefix XOR allows us to compute the XOR of any subarray in constant time.

3. **Index Tracking:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` of lists `inds` to track the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - For each prefix XOR value, it appends the current index to the corresponding list in `inds`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r` using `func_1(int)`.
   - It checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is zero by comparing `x[l-1]` and `x[r]`.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes" because a subarray with a zero XOR can always be split into parts with zero XOR.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a way to split the subarray such that the XOR of the parts is equal.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_3` is a wrapper around `func_2` and is used to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_4` is another wrapper around `func_2` that adds 1 to the result if a valid index is found, or returns `None` if no valid index is found.

### Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation:** This is a standard technique for efficiently computing the XOR of subarrays. The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values and stores them in `x`.
- **Index Tracking:** Using a `defaultdict` to track indices where each prefix XOR value occurs is an efficient way to handle the queries. This allows the program to quickly find the required indices for the binary search.
- **Query Handling:** The logic for handling queries is correct. It checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero and uses binary search to find the required indices if the XOR is not zero.
- **Binary Search Functions:** The binary search functions are implemented correctly and are used appropriately to find the required indices.

The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.
