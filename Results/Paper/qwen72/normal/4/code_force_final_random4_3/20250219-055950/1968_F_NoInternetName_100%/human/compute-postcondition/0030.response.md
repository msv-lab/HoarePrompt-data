Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `i` is incremented by 1, `q` is greater than the new value of `i`, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` or 0 if no such index exists.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `q` remain the same as they were initially returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The list `a` and its properties remain unchanged.
- The list `x` and the defaultdict `inds` remain unchanged.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `q` is still greater than the new value of `i`.
- The variables `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The variable `upper` is calculated as the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`, or 0 if no such index exists.
