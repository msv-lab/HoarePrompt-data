Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`n` and `q`**: These are the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`. The exact values of `n` and `q` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but we know they are integers.
2. **`a`**: This is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. **`x`**: This is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index. For example, if `a = [a1, a2, a3]`, then `x` would be `[0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3]`.
4. **`inds`**: This is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears.
5. **`i`**: This is incremented by 1.
6. **`q`**: After incrementing `i`, `q` is greater than the new value of `i`.
7. **`l` and `r`**: These are the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`. Again, the exact values depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are integers.
8. **`lower`**: This is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists; otherwise, it is 0.
9. **`upper`**: This is the first index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` if such an index exists; otherwise, it is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'No'`.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and the values of the variables described.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
