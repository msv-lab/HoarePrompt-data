You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of integers and a series of queries `q`. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to index `r`. If they are equal, or if there exists a subsequence within the specified range that satisfies certain conditions, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the cumulative XOR list `x` and the index dictionary `inds` are populated based on the elements of `a`. The function has processed all `q` queries.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input using `func_1(int)` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q` using `func_1(int)`, and then reads the array `a` using `func_1(int)`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `x` with a single element `0` to store the prefix XOR values.
   - It iterates through the array `a`, computing the prefix XOR for each element and appending it to `x`.
   - This step is crucial for efficiently answering the queries. The prefix XOR allows us to compute the XOR of any subarray in constant time.

3. **Index Tracking:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` of lists `inds` to track the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - For each prefix XOR value, it appends the current index to the corresponding list in `inds`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r` using `func_1(int)`.
   - It checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is zero by comparing `x[l-1]` and `x[r]`.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes" because a subarray with a zero XOR can always be split into parts with zero XOR.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a way to split the subarray such that the XOR of the parts is equal.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_3` is a wrapper around `func_2` and is used to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_4` is another wrapper around `func_2` that adds 1 to the result if a valid index is found, or returns `None` if no valid index is found.

### Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation:** This is a standard technique for efficiently computing the XOR of subarrays. The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values and stores them in `x`.
- **Index Tracking:** Using a `defaultdict` to track indices where each prefix XOR value occurs is an efficient way to handle the queries. This allows the program to quickly find the required indices for the binary search.
- **Query Handling:** The logic for handling queries is correct. It checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero and uses binary search to find the required indices if the XOR is not zero.
- **Binary Search Functions:** The binary search functions are implemented correctly and are used appropriately to find the required indices.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
