Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `q` is greater than the new value of `i`.
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.
   - The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
