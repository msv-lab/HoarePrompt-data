### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input using `func_1(int)` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q` using `func_1(int)`, and then reads the array `a` using `func_1(int)`.
   - This part of the program is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `x` with a single element `0` to store the prefix XOR values.
   - It iterates through the array `a`, computing the prefix XOR for each element and appending it to `x`.
   - This step is crucial for efficiently answering the queries. The prefix XOR allows us to compute the XOR of any subarray in constant time.
   - The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values and stores them in `x`.

3. **Index Tracking:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` of lists `inds` to track the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - For each prefix XOR value, it appends the current index to the corresponding list in `inds`.
   - This is an efficient way to handle the queries and allows the program to quickly find the required indices for the binary search.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r` using `func_1(int)`.
   - It checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is zero by comparing `x[l-1]` and `x[r]`.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes" because a subarray with a zero XOR can always be split into parts with zero XOR.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a way to split the subarray such that the XOR of the parts is equal.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_3` is a wrapper around `func_2` and is used to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_4` is another wrapper around `func_2` that adds 1 to the result if a valid index is found, or returns `None` if no valid index is found.
   - The binary search functions are implemented correctly and are used appropriately to find the required indices.

### Detailed Analysis of Query Handling:
- **XOR Check:**
  - The program checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]` to determine if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is zero. This is correct because the XOR of a subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`, and if `x[l-1] == x[r]`, then `x[r] ^ x[l-1] == 0`.

- **Binary Search for Indices:**
  - The program uses `func_4` to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.
  - It uses `func_3` to find the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
  - If `upper > lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a way to split the subarray such that the XOR of the parts is equal.
  - This logic is correct because if there exists an index `i` such that `l <= i < r` and `x[i] == x[l-1]`, then the subarray can be split into two parts with equal XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. The original assessment accurately identifies the key components and their correctness.
