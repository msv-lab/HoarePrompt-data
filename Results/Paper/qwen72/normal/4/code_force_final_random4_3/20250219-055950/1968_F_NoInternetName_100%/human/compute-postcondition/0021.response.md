Postcondition: ***`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `q` is greater than 0. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop or the next step of the program. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements in the loop or program.***
