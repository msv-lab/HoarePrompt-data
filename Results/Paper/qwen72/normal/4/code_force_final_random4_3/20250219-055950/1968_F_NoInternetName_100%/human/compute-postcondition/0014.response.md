Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, the result of `1 ^ a[1]`, and the result of `x[-1] ^ a[2]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[1]` containing the integer 1, `inds[1 ^ a[1]]` containing the integers 1 and 2, and `inds[x[-1]]` containing the integers 1, 2, and 3, `i` is the third element of `a`.**
