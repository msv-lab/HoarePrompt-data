Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(func_1(int))` reassigns the variable `a` to be a list of integers returned by the function `func_1(int)`. The length of this list is `n`, and each element `a_i` of the list satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. The values of `n` and `q` remain as they were initially returned by `func_1(int)`, and the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
