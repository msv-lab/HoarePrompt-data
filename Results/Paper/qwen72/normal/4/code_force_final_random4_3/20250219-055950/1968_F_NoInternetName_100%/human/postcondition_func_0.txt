The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cast`, which is a function (like `int` or `str`). It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, and returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element of the split input. The final state of the program includes the returned iterator, which can be used to iterate over the casted elements of the input string.
