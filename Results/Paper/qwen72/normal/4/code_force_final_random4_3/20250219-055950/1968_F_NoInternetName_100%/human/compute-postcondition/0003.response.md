Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integer 0, `inds` is an empty defaultdict of lists.**

The code initializes `inds` as a `defaultdict` with lists as the default factory, making it an empty dictionary where any new key will automatically have an empty list as its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
