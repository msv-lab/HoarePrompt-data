Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of coins that can be collected while avoiding thorns. It simply counts the number of coins in the string and prints it, which is incorrect because it does not consider the movement constraints (moving one or two cells at a time and avoiding thorns).

A specific case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  .@*@.
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs 2 because it counts all the coins without considering the movement constraints and the presence of thorns. The correct output should be 1, as the only valid move from the starting cell is to the second cell, where a coin is collected, and then the path is blocked by thorns.
