Postcondition: ***`s` is 0 or 1, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, and `j` is 1. If `b[j] == '@'`, `s` is set to 1 or 2. If `b[j] == '*'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[j]` is neither `'*'` nor ` '@'`, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
