Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is now 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.***
