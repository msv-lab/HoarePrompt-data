Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters), `cnt` is less than `n`. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set, `tmp` is the character `c`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.***
