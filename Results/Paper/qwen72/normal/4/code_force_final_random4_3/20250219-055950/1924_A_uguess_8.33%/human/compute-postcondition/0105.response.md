Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `t` must be greater than `k`, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' for each time `cnt` was less than `n` before being incremented if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` and then `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a', where `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` if the `(k-1)`-th bit of `cur` is not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << (k-1) == 0`). Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string, `cur` is 0.**
