You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is the number of iterations that have been completed, `n` and `k` are the final input integers from the last iteration, `m` is the final input integer from the last iteration, `s` is the final input string from the last iteration, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1 for the last iteration, and `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s` for the last iteration. If `cur` was set to `(1 << k) - 1` at any point, it was reset to 0, and `cnt` was incremented. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the current value of `cnt` remains unchanged and `ans` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` if the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same, and `ans` is now extended by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if the string `s` can be divided into `n` substrings, each containing all `k` distinct characters. If it can, the function prints 'YES'. If it cannot, the function prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string that represents the closest possible valid substring to meet the condition, padded with additional characters as needed. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes `t` being 0, `i` being the total number of test cases processed, and the last values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` from the final test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` (length of `s`), and then the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0 and `cur` to 0. `cnt` is used to count the number of valid subsequences of length `n` found, and `cur` is used to track the current bitmask of characters seen.

3. **Bitmask Explanation:**
   - The bitmask `cur` is used to represent the presence of characters in the current subsequence.
   - `1 << cur_ss` shifts the bit `1` to the position corresponding to the character `ss` (where `cur_ss` is the index of the character in the alphabet).
   - `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` checks if the character `ss` has not been seen yet in the current subsequence.
   - If the character is new, it adds the corresponding bit to `cur`.
   - `cur == (1 << k) - 1` checks if all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence.

4. **Counting Valid Subsequences:**
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means a valid subsequence of length `n` has been found, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - `cur` is reset to 0 to start checking for the next subsequence.

5. **Output:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
     - `tmp` is initialized to an empty string.
     - `ans` is constructed by repeating the last character (if any) that was not part of the current subsequence.
     - The program then adds the first character that was not seen in the current subsequence.
     - Finally, it adds 'a' to fill the remaining length of the string to `n`.

6. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The logic for constructing `ans` is flawed. It should generate a string of length `n` that does not appear as a subsequence, but the current logic does not ensure this.
   - The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. The logic for constructing the string that does not occur as a subsequence is also incorrect. A correct approach would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` and checking if they are subsequences of `s`, or using a more efficient method to ensure the correctness of the output.
