Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters), `cnt` is less than `n`, and `tmp` is the character `c`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `ord('a') + i` to `tmp`.
- Given `i` is 2, `ord('a') + i` is `ord('a') + 2`, which is `97 + 2 = 99`.
- The character with ASCII value 99 is `c`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged.
