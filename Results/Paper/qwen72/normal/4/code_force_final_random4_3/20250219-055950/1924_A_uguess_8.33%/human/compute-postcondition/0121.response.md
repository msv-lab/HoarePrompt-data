Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is unchanged unless `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, in which case `cnt` is increased by 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.***
