To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `k-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1.
   - `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`.
   - `cnt` is less than `n`.
   - `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` if the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same.
   - `ans` is now extended by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.

2. **Explanation of the Variables:**
   - `t` is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `i` is `k-1`, which means it points to the bit position `k-1` in the bitwise representation `cur`.
   - `n` is the total length of the final string `ans`.
   - `k` is the number of bits being considered in the bitwise representation `cur`.
   - `m` is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `s` is the input string that is processed to set bits in `cur`.
   - `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1.
   - `cur` is the final bitwise representation after processing `s`.
   - `ans` is constructed based on the value of `cnt` and the bit at position `k-1` in `cur`.

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - `ans` starts with `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
   - If the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, `ans` is extended by `tmp`.
   - Finally, `ans` is extended by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The string `ans` will be printed.
   - The first part of `ans` will be `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
   - If the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` will be appended to `ans`.
   - The remaining part of `ans` will be `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.

Given the initial state and the operations, the final output can be described as follows:

Output: **[cnt occurrences of chr(ord('a') + k - 1)] + [tmp if the bit at position k-1 in cur is 0] + [(n - cnt - 1) occurrences of 'a']**

This means:
- The first part of the string `ans` will contain `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
- If the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, the string `tmp` will be appended to `ans`.
- The rest of the string `ans` will contain `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.
