Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is now `1 << cur_ss`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged.
