### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Bitmasking Logic:**
   - The program uses a bitmask `cur` to track the presence of characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets in the current subsequence.
   - For each character `ss` in the string `s`, it calculates `cur_ss` as the index of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
   - It checks if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set. If not, it sets the bit.
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence, and `cnt` is incremented. `cur` is then reset to 0.

3. **Output Logic:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that is not a subsequence of `s`:
     - It initializes `ans` with `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
     - It then finds the first character `tmp` that is not present in the current subsequence (by checking if the bit is not set in `cur`).
     - Finally, it appends `tmp` and `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`.

### Issues:
- **Bitmasking Logic:**
  - The program uses `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` to check if a bit is not set. This is correct.
  - However, the program increments `cnt` when `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, which means it has seen all `k` characters at least once in the current subsequence. This is not the correct condition to check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

- **Subsequence Check:**
  - The program only checks if all `k` characters appear at least once in a subsequence, but it does not check if all possible combinations of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
  - For example, if `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `s = "abba"`, the program will set `cnt` to 2 because it sees both 'a' and 'b' in the string. However, it does not check if all possible strings of length 2 (i.e., "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences of `s`.

- **String Construction:**
  - The program constructs a string that is not a subsequence of `s` by appending `cnt` occurrences of the last character, one character that is not present, and the rest as 'a'.
  - This approach is not guaranteed to produce a string that is not a subsequence of `s`. For example, if `n = 3`, `k = 3`, and `s = "aabbccabab"`, the program might construct "ccc" even though "ccc" is a valid subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
