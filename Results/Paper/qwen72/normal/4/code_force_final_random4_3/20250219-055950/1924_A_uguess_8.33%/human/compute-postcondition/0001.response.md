The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the first value in the range of `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
