Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times and then appended with `tmp`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- `cur` is 0, so the bit at position `i` (which is `k-1`) in `cur` is 0 for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
- Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
- `ans` is updated by appending `tmp` to it, making `ans` a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times and then appended with `tmp`.
- All other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.
