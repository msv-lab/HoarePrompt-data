Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is unchanged unless `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, in which case `cnt` is increased by 1, and `cur` is updated to 0 if `cur == (1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.***
