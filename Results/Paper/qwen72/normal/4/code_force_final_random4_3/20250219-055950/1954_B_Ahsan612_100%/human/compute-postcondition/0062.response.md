Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `len(ar)` must be greater than `i`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `same` is assigned the value 1.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `len(ar)` remain unchanged.
- The value of `minn` is still the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, but since `same` is now 1, `minn` will be the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1.
