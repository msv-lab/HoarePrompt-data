The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop depends on the result of `int(input())` to determine how many times it will execute. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, the input should be consistent with the given constraints for `t`.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `int(input())` ≤ 10^4**
