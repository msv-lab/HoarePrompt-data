Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 6 elements, `minn` is 1, the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`, if `ar[3]` is equal to `num` then `same` is 2, otherwise `same` is 1, `num` is the sixth element of `ar`, `i` is 6.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value (1) and the value of `same` (which is either 1 or 2).
- Since `minn` is already 1, the minimum of 1 and `same` (whether 1 or 2) will still be 1.
- Therefore, `minn` remains 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
