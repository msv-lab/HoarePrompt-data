Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the fifth element of `ar`, `i` is 4, `minn` is 1. Additionally, the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**

The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value (1) and the value of `same` (1). Since both values are 1, `minn` remains 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
