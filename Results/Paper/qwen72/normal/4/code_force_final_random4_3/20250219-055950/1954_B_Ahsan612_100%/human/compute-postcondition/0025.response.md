The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 or 4, and `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

- If `i` is 3, the loop will execute again as long as `len(ar)` is greater than 3.
- If `i` is 4, the loop will execute again as long as `len(ar)` is greater than 4.

Since `ar` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` is 3 or 4, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 4 to guarantee the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3 or 4, `same` is 2 or 3 if `ar[i-1]` == `num`, and `num` is `ar[0]` or `ar[2]` if `i` is 3, otherwise `same` is 1, and `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4**
