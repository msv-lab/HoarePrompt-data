### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Identifying Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1, which is used to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It also initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity (`inf`), which will be used to track the minimum length of consecutive elements.

3. **Traversing the Array:**
   - The program uses a while loop to traverse the array.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it increments `i` by 1, updates `num` to the next element, and updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - It then resets `same` to 1.

4. **Final Check and Output:**
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating that it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Handling Identical Arrays:**
  - If the array consists of all identical elements, the program correctly identifies this by checking if `minn` is equal to the length of the array and outputs `-1`.

- **Handling Non-Identical Arrays:**
  - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same.
  - By removing the minimum number of consecutive elements, it ensures that the array becomes non-beautiful.

### Potential Issues:

- **Incorrect Update of `i`:**
  - The program increments `i` by 1 when `ar[i]` is different from `num`, but it should increment `i` by 2 to skip the next element that is being considered for the operation.
  - This can lead to incorrect results, especially in cases where the array has more complex patterns of consecutive elements.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where the array has only one element correctly by printing `-1`.
  - However, it may not handle cases where the array has two elements correctly, as it would not enter the while loop.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct for all cases. Specifically, the incorrect update of `i` and the potential edge case handling issues make the program flawed.

**Correctness: False**
