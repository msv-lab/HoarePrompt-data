Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 or 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than `i`, `same` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `same` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `same` is unknown, so we only know that `same` is now one more than it was before. The other variables remain unchanged.
