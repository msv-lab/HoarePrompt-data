Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `ar`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `ar` remains the list of integers input by the user, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `same` is reset to 1 at the end of the loop, as the loop always increments `i` and checks the next element, which will be different from the current `num` when the loop exits.
- The variable `num` is the last element of `ar`, because the loop iterates through the list and updates `num` to the current element whenever it finds a different element.
- The variable `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
- The variable `minn` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `ar`, as the loop keeps track of the smallest group of consecutive identical elements it encounters.
