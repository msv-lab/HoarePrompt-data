Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`, `i` is 3 or 4, `minn` is 1.**

The code snippet `same = 1` explicitly sets the variable `same` to 1. Since the initial state already specifies that `same` can be 1 or 2, the output state confirms that `same` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
