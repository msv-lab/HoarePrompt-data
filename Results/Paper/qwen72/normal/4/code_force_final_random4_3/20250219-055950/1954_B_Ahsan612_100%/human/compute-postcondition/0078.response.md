Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar` (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar` (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(minn)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `minn` is determined by the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.
   - `same` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.
   - Since `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is 1, `minn` will be at most 1.
   - Given that `minn` is not `inf` and not equal to the length of `ar`, the only possible value for `minn` is 1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
