Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 1 or 2, `num` is `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `i` is 3 or 4, `minn` is 1 (if `same` is 1)**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 2, it is now 3, and if `i` was 3, it is now 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
