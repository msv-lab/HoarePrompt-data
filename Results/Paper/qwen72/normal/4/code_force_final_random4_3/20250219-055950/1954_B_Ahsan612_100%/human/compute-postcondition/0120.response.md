Output State: **_ is t-1, n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers input by the user, same is 1, num is the last element of ar, i is equal to the length of ar, and minn is the minimum value of consecutive identical elements in ar. If minn is `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, then minn is -1. Otherwise, minn is the smallest number of consecutive identical elements found in any of the arrays processed.**

### Explanation:
- **_ is t-1**: The loop runs `t` times, so after all iterations, the value of `_` will be `t-1` because the loop index starts from 0.
- **n is an input integer**: `n` is the length of the list `ar` for the last test case processed.
- **ar is a list of integers input by the user**: `ar` is the list of integers for the last test case processed.
- **same is 1**: After processing the last array, `same` is reset to 1 because the loop ends after the last element is processed, and `same` is not updated further.
- **num is the last element of ar**: `num` holds the last element of the array `ar` because the loop ends after the last element is processed.
- **i is equal to the length of ar**: The loop index `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` after the loop has processed all elements of the array.
- **minn is the minimum value of consecutive identical elements in ar**: `minn` is updated to the minimum value of consecutive identical elements found in the array `ar` during the loop. If `minn` is `inf` or equal to the length of `ar` (indicating no consecutive identical elements or all elements are the same), it is set to -1. Otherwise, it holds the smallest number of consecutive identical elements found in any of the arrays processed.
