### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer \(t\) which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates `root` as the integer part of the square root of \(n\) plus 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - The function `func_1` reads \(n\) and \(k\) instead of \(n\) and \(m\). This is a clear mismatch with the problem statement.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem requirements. It is supposed to count pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the current logic is adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`, which is unrelated to the problem.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly handling the input and is not performing the necessary calculations to count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem statement and the logic implemented does not solve the given problem.
