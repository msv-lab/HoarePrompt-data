Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the program does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a different value and prints it. The logic inside `func_1` is not related to the problem statement and does not handle the required conditions for the pairs (a, b). For example, for the input (n=2, m=3), the program will not produce the correct output of 3, as it does not even consider the value of `m` in its calculations.
