Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1 and must be greater than 2, `cnt` is 9, `ans` is increased by `(n + 2) // 4`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `i * i`. Since `i` is 3, `cnt` becomes 9.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `root`, and the condition for `ans` remain unchanged.
