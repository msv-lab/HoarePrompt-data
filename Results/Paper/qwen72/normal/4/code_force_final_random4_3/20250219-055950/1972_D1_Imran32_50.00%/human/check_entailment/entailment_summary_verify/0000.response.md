### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. However, the problem statement specifies that the input should be `n` and `m`, not `n` and `k`. This is a discrepancy in variable naming.
   - The function initializes `ans` to `n` and then iterates over `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1. For each `i`, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i` and adds \((n + i) // cnt\) to `ans`.
   - The function then prints the final value of `ans`.

2. **Problem Statement**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program does not implement any logic to check the conditions \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program does not even consider the value of `m` in its calculations, which is a critical part of the problem.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes what `func_1` does, but it does not align with the problem statement. The function calculates a different value and does not solve the problem as required.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The logic inside `func_1` is not related to the required conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final:
**False**
