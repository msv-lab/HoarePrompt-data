The function `oacm` is intended to process multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10^6. The function should read the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) from input, and for each test case, it should read `n` and `m` and calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b · gcd(a, b). The function should print the result for each test case.
