Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
