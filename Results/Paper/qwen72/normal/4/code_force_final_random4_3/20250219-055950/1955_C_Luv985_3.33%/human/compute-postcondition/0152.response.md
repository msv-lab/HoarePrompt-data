Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[r] -= mi` updates the value of `a[r]` by subtracting `mi` from it.
- Since `r` is `n - 1`, the last element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`) is updated.
- The value of `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
