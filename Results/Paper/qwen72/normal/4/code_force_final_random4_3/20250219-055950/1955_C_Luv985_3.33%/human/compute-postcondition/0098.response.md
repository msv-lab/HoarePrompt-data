Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. If `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
