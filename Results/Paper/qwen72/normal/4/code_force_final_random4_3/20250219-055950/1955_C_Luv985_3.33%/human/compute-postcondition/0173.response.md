Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.
- The values of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are already updated to `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1] - mi`, respectively, as per the initial state.
- All other variables (`a`, `T`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
