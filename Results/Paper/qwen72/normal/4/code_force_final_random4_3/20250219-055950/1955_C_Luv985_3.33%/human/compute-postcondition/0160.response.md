Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer minus `2 * mi` and must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 1. The current value of `a[r]` is 0.**
