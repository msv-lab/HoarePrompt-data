Postcondition: ***`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[n-1]` (after adjustment) was 0, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r` plus 1. In all cases, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.***
