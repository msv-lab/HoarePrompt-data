Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi`, `r` is `n - 2`, and if `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, and if `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 2, `k` is updated based on the initial conditions. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi`, and `a[l]` and `a[r]` are also updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r] - mi` respectively. `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[l]` was initially 0, and `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[r]` is 0. If `a[r]` was initially 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on whether `a[r]` is 0, and `ans` is updated to 1 or 2 depending on its initial value. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
