Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 0, `r` must be `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` or `a[n-2]`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions described. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2 as it was initially. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
