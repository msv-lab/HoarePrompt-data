Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` is updated by subtracting `mi` from it.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the execution of the code.
- `a[l]` was already updated to `a[l] - mi` in the initial state.
- The updated values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` reflect the subtraction of `mi` from their respective positions in the list `a`.
