You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which is not used within the function. It then reads 10 pairs of integers (each pair on a new line) and stores them in two lists, `x` and `y`. After collecting the inputs, the function iterates through these lists and prints each pair of integers in a sorted order, ensuring that the smaller integer is printed first followed by the larger integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `y` each contain 10 integers, and the function has printed 10 lines of sorted integer pairs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly for the number of test cases. The problem description specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, but the program always reads 10 lines of input, regardless of the value of `t`. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will read more lines than necessary, and if `t` is greater than 10, the program will not read all the test cases. For example, if the input is:

```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```

The program will still read 10 lines, leading to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
