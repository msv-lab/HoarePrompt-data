Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces.
   - `x` is an empty list.
   - `y` is an empty list.
   - If `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is true. Otherwise, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The lists `x` and `y` are both empty.
   - The code attempts to access `x[1]` and `y[1]` (since `i` is 1).
   - Accessing an element at index 1 of an empty list will raise an `IndexError` because the list has no elements.

Since the lists `x` and `y` are empty, trying to access `x[1]` and `y[1]` will result in an `IndexError`. Therefore, the code will not print anything and will instead raise an error.

Output: **IndexError (since `x` and `y` are empty lists and attempting to access `x[1]` and `y[1]` will raise an `IndexError`)**
