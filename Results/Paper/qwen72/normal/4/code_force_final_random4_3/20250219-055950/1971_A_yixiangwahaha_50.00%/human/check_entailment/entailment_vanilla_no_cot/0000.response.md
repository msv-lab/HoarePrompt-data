Correctness: **False**

The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Input Handling for Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it to control the number of iterations. Instead, it always loops 10 times, which is incorrect if `t` is not 10.

2. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the minimum and maximum values with an extra space between them and the numbers. The problem description does not specify this, and it might be interpreted as incorrect if the output format is strictly checked.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

This version correctly handles the number of test cases and ensures that the output format matches the problem description.
