Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces.
   - `x` is an empty list.
   - `y` is an empty list.
   - The current value of `x[0]` is less than the current value of `y[0]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are both empty lists.
   - Accessing `x[0]` and `y[0]` will raise an `IndexError` because both lists are empty and do not have any elements at index 0.

Given that `x` and `y` are empty lists, attempting to access `x[0]` and `y[0]` will result in an `IndexError` before the `print` statement can execute. Therefore, the code will not print anything and will instead raise an error.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
