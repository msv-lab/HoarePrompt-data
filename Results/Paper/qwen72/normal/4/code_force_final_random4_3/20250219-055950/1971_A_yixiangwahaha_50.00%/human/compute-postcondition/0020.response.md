Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces.
   - `x` is an empty list.
   - `y` is an empty list.
   - The condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `x` and `y` are both empty lists, they have no elements.
   - The index `i` is 0.
   - Accessing an element at index 0 of an empty list will raise an `IndexError` because the list does not have any elements.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code will not print any values because it will encounter an `IndexError` when trying to access `x[0]` and `y[0]`.

Output: **IndexError (because `x` and `y` are empty lists and cannot be indexed at 0)**
