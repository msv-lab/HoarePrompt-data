Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 2, `n` is the new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the last integer in the new `s`, `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index `x` is incremented by 1, `t` is 2, `n` is the new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a`, `i` is the first integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index `x` is incremented by 2, `t` is 2, `n` is the new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a` followed by the character at index `x` in `a`, `i` is the second integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index `x` is incremented by 3, `t` is 2, `n` is the new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with at least 3 elements, `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a` repeated three times, `i` is the third integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
