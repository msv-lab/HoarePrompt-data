Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. The input parameters should be a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists a suitable string s. `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. `b` is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string composed of characters from `a` at indices specified by `s`, in the order they appear in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the string containing the characters at the indices in `a` corresponding to the values in `s`, `i` is the last integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 2, `n` is the new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by `s`, in the order of `s`, with each character appearing as many times as its corresponding integer in `s`, `i` is the last integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
