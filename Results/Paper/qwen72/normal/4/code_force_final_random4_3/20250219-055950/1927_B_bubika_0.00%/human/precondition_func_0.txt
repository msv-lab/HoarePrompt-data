The function `func` is expected to be called with input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. The input parameters should be a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists a suitable string s.
