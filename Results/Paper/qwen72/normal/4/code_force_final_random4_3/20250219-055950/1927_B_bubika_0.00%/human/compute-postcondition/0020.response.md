The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `t`.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string composed of characters from `a` at indices specified by `s`, in the order they appear in `s`**
