Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string composed of characters from `a` at indices specified by `s`, in the order they appear in `s`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The string `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- The list `b` is updated such that each element at index `i` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in the list `s`.
- The integer `t` remains 0.
- The integer `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- The list `s` remains the same list of integers provided by the user.
- The string `r` is constructed by appending the character at index `i` in `a` for each integer `i` in `s`, in the order they appear in `s`.
