Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 500`), calculates a sum based on a specific formula, and prints the sum along with `2 * n`. Additionally, for each value of `n`, it prints two lines of output for each integer from 1 to `n`, where each line contains a fixed pattern of numbers. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and for each executed `n`, the sum is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 2. **
