The code snippet `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to the current value of `sum`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `i` is 2.
- `i * i` is `2 * 2` which equals 4.
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `(2 - 1) * (2 - 1)` which equals 1.
- `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `4 - 1` which equals 3.
- `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is `3 * 2` which equals 6.

The initial value of `sum` is 1. Adding 6 to `sum` results in `sum` being 7.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `n`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 7, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `t` is `t` - 1**
