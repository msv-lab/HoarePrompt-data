Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1 + (j + 1) * (2 * j + 1), `i` is `j` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation:
- The expression `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` simplifies to `2 * i - 1`.
- Substituting `i` with `j + 1`, the expression becomes `2 * (j + 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `2 * j + 1`.
- The final expression `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` becomes `sum += (2 * j + 1) * (j + 1)`.
- Therefore, `sum` is updated to `1 + (2 * j + 1) * (j + 1)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `n`) remain unchanged.
