Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `i` is n + 1, `j` is n.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- **`sum`**: This variable remains unchanged and still represents the sum of the series \(1 + (2 \times 2 - 1 \times 1) \times 2 + (3 \times 3 - 2 \times 2) \times 3 + \ldots + (n \times n - (n - 1) \times (n - 1)) \times n\).
- **`i`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still \(n + 1\).
- **`j`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `j` will have the value of `n`. This is because the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive, and the final value of `j` will be `n` when the loop ends.
