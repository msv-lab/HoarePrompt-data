Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n` + 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is `1`, which is a constant.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `n`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the output will always include at least the numbers 1 and 2.

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the range from 1 to n is the sequence of integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
