Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n` + 1.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `t` is `t` - 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum, n + n)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `sum` is defined as \( n^3 \). Since `n` must be at least 2, the value of `sum` will be \( n^3 \) where `n` is at least 2.
   - `n + n` is simply `2 * n`. Since `n` must be at least 2, the value of `2 * n` will be at least 4.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `sum` and the value of `2 * n`.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `2 * n` is \( 2n \).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **\( n^3 \), \( 2n \) (where \( n \) is at least 2)**
