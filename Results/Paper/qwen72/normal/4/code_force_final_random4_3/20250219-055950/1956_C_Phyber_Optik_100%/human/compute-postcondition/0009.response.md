Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 + (4 * 4 - 3 * 3) * 4, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. The current value of `i` is 4, so the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` evaluates to `(4 * 4 - 3 * 3) * 4`, which is `(16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` is the original value plus 28. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 4.
