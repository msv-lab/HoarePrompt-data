Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it.
- With `i` being 2, the expression evaluates to `(2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 = (4 - 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6`.
- Therefore, `sum` is now `1 + 6 = 7`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
