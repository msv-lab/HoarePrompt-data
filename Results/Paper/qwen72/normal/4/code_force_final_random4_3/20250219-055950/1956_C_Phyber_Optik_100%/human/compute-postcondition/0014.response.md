Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `sum` is calculated as follows: 
  \[
  \text{sum} = 1 + (2 \times 2 - 1 \times 1) \times 2 + (3 \times 3 - 2 \times 2) \times 3 + \ldots + (n \times n - (n - 1) \times (n - 1)) \times n
  \]
  However, the value of `sum` is not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant integer value.
   - It will be printed as `2`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.
   - It will be printed as `n`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - It will be printed as the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- The constant integer `2`.
- The value of `n`.
- The sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence is from 1 to n inclusive)**
