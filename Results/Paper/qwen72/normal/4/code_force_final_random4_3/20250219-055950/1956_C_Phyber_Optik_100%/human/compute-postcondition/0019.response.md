Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `sum` is defined by the formula: \( 1 + (2^2 - 1^2) \cdot 2 + (3^2 - 2^2) \cdot 3 + \ldots + (n^2 - (n-1)^2) \cdot n \).
   - `i` is \( n + 1 \).
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to \( n - 3 + 1 = n - 2 \).
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 2`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a sequence of numbers starting with `1`, followed by `n - 2`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the range from 1 to n is the sequence of integers from 1 to n)**
