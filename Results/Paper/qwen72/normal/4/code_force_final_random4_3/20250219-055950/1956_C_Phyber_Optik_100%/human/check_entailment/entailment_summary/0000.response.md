### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
   - Simplifying the term inside the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the formula becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i
     \]
   - Expanding the sum:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Adjusting the sums to start from 2:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Substituting these into the sum formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 3n(n+1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n+2 - 3)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n - 1)}{6}
     \]
   - This matches the expected maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
   - It then prints \( 2n \) lines of operations, where each line is either a Type 1 or Type 2 operation.
   - For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it prints:
     - Type 1 operation on row \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - Type 2 operation on column \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations are valid as they follow the rules given in the problem statement.
   - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation uses a valid permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

4. **Verification**:
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     - The sum is 1, and the program outputs 1 operation.
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The sum is 7, and the program outputs 4 operations.
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates valid operations to achieve this sum. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
