The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `i` starting from 2 up to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2, `i` is 3**
