The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and it is updated to the value provided by the user, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values during the loop execution.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
