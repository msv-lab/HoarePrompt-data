The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be at least 2 (or more specifically, at least 3 to allow the loop to execute again).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
