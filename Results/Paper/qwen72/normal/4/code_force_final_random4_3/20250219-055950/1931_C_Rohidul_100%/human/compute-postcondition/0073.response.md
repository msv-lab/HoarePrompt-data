Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 3, `end` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**. 

The value of `st` has been incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
