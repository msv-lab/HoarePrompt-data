The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `r` is `n - 3`, so after the decrement, `r` becomes `n - 4`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than `st + 2`, `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal and the next two elements (i.e., `a[r - 1]` and `a[r - 2]`) are also equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is 3**.
