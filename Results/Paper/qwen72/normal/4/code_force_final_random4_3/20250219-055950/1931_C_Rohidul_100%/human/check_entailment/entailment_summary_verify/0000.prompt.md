You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        le = len(a)
        (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
        (st, end) = (1, 1)
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of an array and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of elements in the array that need to be removed to make the array either empty or have all elements equal to the first or last element, depending on the specific conditions. The function prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input for each test case, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` or `n - 1` if all elements are equal, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[-1]` or `0` if all elements are equal, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`, and `ans` is `le - max(st, end)` if `a[0] != a[-1]` or `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0] == a[-1]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple distinct elements, and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The correct output should be `3` because the optimal way to make all elements equal is to select `i = 2`, `j = 3`, and `x = 2`, which costs `2` burles. However, the program will output `1` because it only considers the longest prefix and suffix of equal elements, and it does not account for the possibility that the optimal solution might involve a different value.

This shows that the program is not handling all potential cases correctly, and thus, it is incorrect.
