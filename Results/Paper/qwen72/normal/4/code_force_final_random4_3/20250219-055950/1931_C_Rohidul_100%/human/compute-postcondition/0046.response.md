Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `l + 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `l` and `st` as long as the current element `a[l]` is equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`.
- After all iterations, `l` will be the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to the first element `a[0]`.
- The variable `st` will be `l + 1`, reflecting the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of the list that are equal to `a[0]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `r`, `end`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `l` and `st` which are modified by the loop.
- If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `a[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`), then `l` will remain 0 and `st` will remain 1.
- If all elements in the list `a` are equal, then `l` will be `le - 1` (the last index of the list), and `st` will be `le` (the length of the list).
