Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple distinct elements, and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The correct output should be `3` because the optimal way to make all elements equal is to select `i = 2`, `j = 3`, and `x = 2`, which costs `2` burles. However, the program will output `1` because it only considers the longest prefix and suffix of equal elements, and it does not account for the possibility that the optimal solution might involve a different value.

This shows that the program is not handling all potential cases correctly, and thus, it is incorrect.
