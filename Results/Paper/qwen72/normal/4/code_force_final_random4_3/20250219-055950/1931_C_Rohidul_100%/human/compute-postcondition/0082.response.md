Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1 and `n > st`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input and the first `st` elements of `a` are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`, and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, changing from `n - 2` to `n - 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
