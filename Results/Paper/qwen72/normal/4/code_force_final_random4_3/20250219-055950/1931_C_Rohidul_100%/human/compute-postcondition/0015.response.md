Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user where the first `st` elements are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `l` will be equal to `st - 1`, where `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`. The variable `r` remains unchanged as `n - 1`, and `st` will be the count of these consecutive equal elements. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, and `end`) remain in their initial states, with `a` being a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal.
