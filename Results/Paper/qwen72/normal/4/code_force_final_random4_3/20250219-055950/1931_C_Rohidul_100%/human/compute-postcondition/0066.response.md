Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `l + 1`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `a[r]`, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**.
