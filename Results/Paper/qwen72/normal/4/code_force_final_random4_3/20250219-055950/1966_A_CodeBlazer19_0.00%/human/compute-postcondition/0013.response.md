Output State: **`t` iterations have completed, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the last input integers, `l` is the last list of integers provided by the user.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The loop has run a total of `t` times.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `t-1` (the last index in the range of `t`).
- The variables `n` and `k` hold the values of the last input integers provided during the final iteration.
- The list `l` contains the last list of integers provided by the user during the final iteration.
