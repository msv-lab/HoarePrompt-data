The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value or modify the input parameters. After the function concludes, `t` iterations have completed, and the last values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are the ones from the final test case.
