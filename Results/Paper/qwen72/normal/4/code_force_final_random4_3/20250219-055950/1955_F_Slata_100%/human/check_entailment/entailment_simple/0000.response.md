### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve can remove one number at a time to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes zero as often as possible.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired off such that the XOR of each pair is zero.

4. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( a, b, c, d \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
   - The program then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
     - Dividing each count by 2 (to account for pairs that can be removed without affecting the XOR).
     - Adding an additional win if the sum of the remainders of \( a, b, \) and \( c \) is exactly 3 (this ensures that the remaining numbers can be paired off to make the XOR zero).

5. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - \( a // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of 1s.
   - \( b // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of 2s.
   - \( c // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of 3s.
   - \( d // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of 4s.
   - \( int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3) \) checks if the sum of the remainders of \( a, b, \) and \( c \) is 3. If it is, it adds an additional win.

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed without affecting the XOR.
   - The additional win condition ensures that if there are exactly three unpaired numbers (1, 2, 3), the remaining numbers can be paired off to make the XOR zero.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
