### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) and the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The XOR of two identical numbers is zero.
   - The XOR of different numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) can be non-zero.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s can be paired such that each pair has a zero XOR.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove pairs of numbers that have the same value, as removing a pair of identical numbers will not change the XOR of the remaining numbers.
   - After removing pairs, the remaining numbers are `a % 2`, `b % 2`, `c % 2`, and `d % 2`.

4. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The maximum number of pairs that can be removed for each type of number is `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` respectively.
   - This part of the program is correct.

5. **Remaining Numbers**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the remaining numbers (after removing pairs) is 3 and adds 1 to the total count if it is.
   - This is because the XOR of three unpaired numbers (1, 2, 3) is zero, which allows Bob to win one more time.

6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed for each type of number.
   - It then checks if the sum of the remaining numbers is 3 and adds 1 to the total count if it is.

7. **Edge Cases and Verification**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - **Test Case 1**: (1, 1, 1, 0)
       - Pairs: 0 (1s), 0 (2s), 0 (3s), 0 (4s)
       - Remaining: 1 (1s), 1 (2s), 1 (3s), 0 (4s)
       - Sum of remaining: 3
       - Bob wins: 0 + 1 = 1
     - **Test Case 2**: (1, 0, 1, 2)
       - Pairs: 0 (1s), 0 (2s), 0 (3s), 1 (4s)
       - Remaining: 1 (1s), 0 (2s), 1 (3s), 0 (4s)
       - Sum of remaining: 2
       - Bob wins: 1 + 0 = 1
     - **Test Case 3**: (2, 2, 2, 0)
       - Pairs: 1 (1s), 1 (2s), 1 (3s), 0 (4s)
       - Remaining: 0 (1s), 0 (2s), 0 (3s), 0 (4s)
       - Sum of remaining: 0
       - Bob wins: 3 + 0 = 3
     - **Test Case 4**: (3, 3, 2, 0)
       - Pairs: 1 (1s), 1 (2s), 1 (3s), 0 (4s)
       - Remaining: 1 (1s), 1 (2s), 0 (3s), 0 (4s)
       - Sum of remaining: 2
       - Bob wins: 3 + 0 = 3
     - **Test Case 5**: (0, 9, 9, 9)
       - Pairs: 4 (2s), 4 (3s), 4 (4s)
       - Remaining: 1 (2s), 1 (3s), 1 (4s)
       - Sum of remaining: 3
       - Bob wins: 12 + 1 = 13

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.
   - The logic for counting pairs and checking the sum of remaining numbers is correct.
   - The provided examples and the function summary support the correctness of the program.
