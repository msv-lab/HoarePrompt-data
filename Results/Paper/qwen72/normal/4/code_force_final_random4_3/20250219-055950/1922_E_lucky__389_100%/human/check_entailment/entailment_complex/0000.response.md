Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Handling the Special Case `X = 2`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `X = 2` by printing `1` and `0`. This is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

3. **Finding the Required Array**:
   - The program uses a while loop to decompose `X` into a sum of powers of 2. This is a valid approach because every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).
   - For each power of 2 found, the program appends the corresponding exponent to `subseq_lens` and subtracts the power of 2 from `X`.
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum exponent found, which is used to determine the length of the initial part of the array.

4. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx-1`. This ensures that the array has a strictly increasing sequence of length `mx`.
   - Then, it appends the elements from `subseq_lens[1:]` to `ansv`. This is intended to ensure that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program should handle the case where no such array exists. However, the problem statement does not specify any conditions under which no such array exists, so the program assumes that an array can always be found.
   - The program ensures that the array length is at most 200 and the elements are within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

7. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program returns `-1` for the special case `X = 2`, but it should not return anything. Instead, it should continue to the next test case.
   - The program does not handle the case where `X` is 1, which is not within the valid range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), but it should still be considered for completeness.

Given the above reasoning, the program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with the special case handling for `X = 2`.

Correctness: **False**
