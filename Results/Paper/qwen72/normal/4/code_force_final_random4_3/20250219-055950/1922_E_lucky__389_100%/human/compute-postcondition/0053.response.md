Output State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is not 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), and `i` is not 0, `subseq_lens` is a list that includes the value `i - 1`, `x` is now equal to the original `x` minus \(2^{(i - 1)}\).**

In natural language: The value of `x` has been updated to be the original value of `x` minus \(2^{(i - 1)}\). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
