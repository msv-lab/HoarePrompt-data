Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `x` is 0.
2. `subseq_lens` is a list of integers.
3. `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.
4. `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by the elements `subseq_lens[1]` through `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens)-1]`.
5. `i` is 0.
6. `ansv` must have at least 1 element.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ansv[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `mx`**:
   - `mx` is the maximum integer in the list `subseq_lens`.

2. **Construct `ansv`**:
   - `ansv` is constructed by first including integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - Then, it includes the elements from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens)-1]`.

3. **Determine the first element of `ansv`**:
   - Since `i` is 0, `ansv[i]` will be the first element of `ansv`.
   - The first element of `ansv` is always 0 because `ansv` starts with integers from 0 to `mx-1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the first element of `ansv` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
The first element of `ansv` is 0, and the `print` statement will output this value followed by a space.

Output: **0 **
