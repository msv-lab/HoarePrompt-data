#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input. It prints the length of an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, followed by the elements of the array. If `X` is 2, it prints `1` and `0` and returns -1. If no such array exists, it also returns -1. The elements of the array are within the range [-10^9, 10^9] and the array has a length of at most 200.
