The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `2 ** i` is still less than or equal to `x`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3.
- `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 4.

For the loop to execute one more time, `2 ** i` must be less than or equal to `x`. With `i` being 3, `2 ** 3` is 8. Therefore, `x` must be at least 8 for the loop to execute again.

Since `x` is already at least 4, and the loop condition `2 ** i <= x` needs to be satisfied, we need to adjust `i` to the next value, which is 4, and ensure that `x` is at least 16 (since `2 ** 4` is 16).

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 16, `i` is 4**
