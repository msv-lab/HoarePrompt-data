To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

- `i` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer and must be a positive integer not equal to 0 and not equal to 2.

Given that `i` is 0, `2 ** i` will always be 1 (since \(2^0 = 1\)). Therefore, the condition `2 ** i <= x` will be true as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 1.

However, since `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0 and not equal to 2, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 1 and not 2. The smallest value `x` can take is 1, but since `x` cannot be 2, the next smallest value `x` can take is 3.

Thus, the condition `2 ** i <= x` will be true if `x` is 3 or greater.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 3, `i` is 0.**
