Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list of integers.
   - `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.
   - `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by the elements `subseq_lens[1]` through `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens)-1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ansv` must have at least 1 element.

2. **Understanding `ansv`:**
   - The first part of `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - The second part of `ansv` is a list of elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end of the list.

3. **Index `i` in `ansv`:**
   - `i` is 1, so we need to determine the value of `ansv[1]`.

4. **Constructing `ansv`:**
   - Let's assume `subseq_lens` is `[a, b, c, d, ...]` where `a, b, c, d, ...` are integers.
   - `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`.
   - The first part of `ansv` will be `[0, 1, 2, ..., mx-1]`.
   - The second part of `ansv` will be `[b, c, d, ...]`.

5. **Value of `ansv[1]`:**
   - Since `ansv` starts with integers from 0 to `mx-1`, the element at index 1 will be 1.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `ansv[1]` followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 **
