Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`. If `i + x < n` for any `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`, then `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` for each such `i`. `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)` reads a list of integers from the input, converts them to a list of integers, sorts the list in descending order, and assigns it to `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` was a list of input integers sorted in descending order, which is now updated to reflect the sorted list.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.
