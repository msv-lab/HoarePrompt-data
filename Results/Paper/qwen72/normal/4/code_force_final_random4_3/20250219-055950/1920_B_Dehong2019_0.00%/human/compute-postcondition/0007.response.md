Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the first element in the list `a` from `ans1`. The initial value of `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`. After executing this line, `ans1` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the first element of `a`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted in descending order.
