Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and the initial `ans2`. Otherwise, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`, and `ans` is the maximum value between this `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.***
