Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `cnt` is the sum of:
  - `1` if the first three elements of `a` are all odd.
  - The floor division of each element in `a` by 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check the first three elements of `a`**:
   - If the first three elements of `a` are all odd, then `cnt` will be incremented by `1`.
   - If any of the first three elements are not odd, `cnt` will not be incremented by `1`.

2. **Calculate the floor division of each element in `a` by 2**:
   - For each element `x` in the list `a`, the floor division `x // 2` is computed.
   - The results of these floor divisions are summed up and added to `cnt`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example list `a` to understand the calculation better:
- Suppose `a = [3, 5, 7, 4, 6]`.

3. **Check the first three elements**:
   - The first three elements are `3`, `5`, and `7`, which are all odd.
   - Therefore, `cnt` is incremented by `1`.

4. **Calculate the floor division**:
   - `3 // 2 = 1`
   - `5 // 2 = 2`
   - `7 // 2 = 3`
   - `4 // 2 = 2`
   - `6 // 2 = 3`

5. **Sum the results**:
   - The sum of the floor divisions is `1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 11`.
   - Adding the `1` from the first three elements being odd, `cnt` becomes `11 + 1 = 12`.

### General Description:
- The value of `cnt` will be the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, plus `1` if the first three elements of `a` are all odd.

### Final Output:
Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, plus 1 if the first three elements of `a` are all odd)**
