Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is 1 + `math.floor(x / 2)` if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the first element of `a`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to it.
- If the first three elements of `a` are all odd, `cnt` was initially 1, so now `cnt` is 1 + `math.floor(x / 2)`.
- If the first three elements of `a` are not all odd, `cnt` was initially 0, so now `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2)`.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
