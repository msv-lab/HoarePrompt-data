Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is 0.**

The variable `cnt` is reset to 0, and the other variables `_`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `cnt` are no longer relevant as it has been explicitly set to 0.
