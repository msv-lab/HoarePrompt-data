Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cnt` is `cnt` + `math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the first integer in the list `a`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value.
- The value of `x` is the first integer in the list `a`.
- The other variables (`_`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `cnt` is the sum of its previous value and `math.floor(x / 2)`.
