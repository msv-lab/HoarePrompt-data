Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, minus 1, from the user inputs; `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is the array of previous nodes returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`; `_` is the second return value from the `bfs` function, which is not used.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`.
- Since `a` is already the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` will have the same value as `a`.
- The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The initial state is updated to reflect the new value of `b`.
