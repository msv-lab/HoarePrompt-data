Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1999, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` now contains `[v]` and any previous values, and `u2vs[v]` contains `[u]` and any previous values; `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 2; `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`.
- `u` and `v` are derived from user inputs, with `u` being the first integer provided minus 2, and `v` being the second integer provided minus 3.
- The list `u2vs[u]` now includes `v` along with any previous values it contained.
- The list `u2vs[v]` still contains `u` and any previous values it had.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 3 and 1999, inclusive.
