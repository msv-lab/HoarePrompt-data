The function `func_2` reads the number of vertices and edges of a tree from standard input, constructs an adjacency list for the tree, and finds the longest path in the tree. It then generates a list of operations based on the path length. If the path length is odd, it generates operations for the middle node and all nodes up to the middle. If the path length is even, it generates operations for the two middle nodes and all nodes up to the middle. The function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, and returns `None`.
