Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are assigned new integer values from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- If the new `x` > the new `y`, `x` is greater than `y`.
- Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y, x)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Values**: The values of `x` and `y` are determined by the input provided to the program. These values are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to consider the possible scenarios based on the condition given.
2. **Condition**: The condition `x > y` determines whether `x` is greater than `y` or not. However, this condition does not change the values of `x` and `y` themselves; it only provides a comparison.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x` in that order.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `x > y`, then `x` is greater than `y`.
- **Scenario 2**: If `x <= y`, then `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

In both scenarios, the values of `x` and `y` remain the same as they were input. The print statement will simply output these values in the order `y, x`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the input values.

Output: **y, x (where y and x are the integer values assigned from the input)**
