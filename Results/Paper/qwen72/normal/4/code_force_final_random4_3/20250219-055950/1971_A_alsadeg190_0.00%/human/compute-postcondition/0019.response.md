The function `func` is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, the function receives two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 9. However, the function signature provided does not include any parameters. This suggests that the function might be using external variables or inputs that are not part of its parameters. Since the task is to describe the functionality based on the provided information, we can infer that the function is designed to be called in a specific context where `x` and `y` are provided externally.

Functionality: **The function is designed to be called `t` times within a loop, where `t` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100. For each call, the function processes two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 9) that are provided externally. The function's specific output or return value is not defined in the provided information.**
