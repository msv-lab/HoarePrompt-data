### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Invocation:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.
   - The function `func_1()` should be defined to handle the input and logic for each test case. The provided function definition is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

3. **Logic for Finding the Maximum Prefix Subsequence:**
   - The variable `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.
   - The program iterates over each character in string `a` using a for loop with index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a while loop to find the next matching character in `b` starting from position `j`.
   - If a match is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), it increments `k` and `j` to move to the next character in both strings.
   - If no match is found (`j >= m`), it breaks out of the loop, as it cannot find a longer prefix subsequence.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `k`, which is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - The function then returns, which is not necessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. The input handling, loop logic, and output are all consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
