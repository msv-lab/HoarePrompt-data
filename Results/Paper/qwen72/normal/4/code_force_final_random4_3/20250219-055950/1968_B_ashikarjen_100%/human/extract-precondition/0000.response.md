Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

**Where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
