Postcondition: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` and `j < m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]`. The current value of `j` is less than `m`.**
