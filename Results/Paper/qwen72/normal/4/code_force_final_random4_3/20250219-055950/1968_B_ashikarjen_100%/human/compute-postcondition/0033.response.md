The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0. If `j` < `m`, `j` is increased by 1 and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is equal to `m` or no such index exists, `j` remains `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
