Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m` is equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.** 

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` respectively.
- The values of `L`, `t`, and `M` remain unchanged.
- The value of `q` is still the ceiling of `k / m`.
- The conditions for `N` and `cost` remain the same as in the initial state, but now `n`, `m`, and `k` are specific values from `L`.
