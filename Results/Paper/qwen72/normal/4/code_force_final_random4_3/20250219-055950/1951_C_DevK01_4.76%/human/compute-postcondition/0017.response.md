Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is updated by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
