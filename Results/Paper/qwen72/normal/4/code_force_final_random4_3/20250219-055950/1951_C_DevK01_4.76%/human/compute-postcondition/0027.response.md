Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.**

Explanation: The value of `q` is updated to the ceiling of the division of `k` by `m`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
