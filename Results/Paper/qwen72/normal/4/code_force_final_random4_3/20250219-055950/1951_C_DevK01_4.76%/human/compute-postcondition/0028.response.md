Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.**

Explanation:
- `L` remains a new list of integers provided by the user.
- `t` is still greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1.
- `M` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input.
- `n` is still `L[0]`.
- `m` is still the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `k` is still `L[2]`.
- `q` is still the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `N` is now a new list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
