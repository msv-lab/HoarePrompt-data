Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought, `k`, is greater than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single day, `m`, but less than `m * n`. The logic in the program incorrectly calculates the cost in such scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 3 7
1 2 3 4 5
```

The expected output should be `21`, but the program will output `28`. The correct approach would be to buy 3 tickets on the first day (cost = 3), 3 tickets on the second day (cost = 6), and 1 ticket on the third day (cost = 4), resulting in a total cost of `13`. However, the program's logic incorrectly calculates the cost, leading to an incorrect result.
