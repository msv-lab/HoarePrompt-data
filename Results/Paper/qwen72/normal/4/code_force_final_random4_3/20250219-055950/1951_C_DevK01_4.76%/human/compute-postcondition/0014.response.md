Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of `N` - 1, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- The initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `mu`.
- `mu` is now equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, which is a specific value based on the initial values of `k`, `n`, and `m`.
