Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m` is equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order.
- The initial state specifies that `M` is a sorted list of integers, but the sorting operation ensures that `M` is indeed sorted, which is now explicitly confirmed.
- The values of `L`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the sorting of `M`.
- The initial conditions and relationships between the variables remain valid.
