To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, we need to follow the steps described in the initial state and the code snippet. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
   - `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1).
   - `M` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input.
   - `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then:
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element.
     - `w` is the last element of the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The value of `cost` depends on the conditions and the values of `L`, `M`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `n`, `w`, and `mu`.
   - Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Let's summarize the output:

- If `n * m == k`, then:
  - `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise:
  - `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated as follows: if n * m == k, cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2); otherwise, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, with N being the first q elements of M, w being the last element of the first q elements of M, and mu being k - (n - 1) * m)**
