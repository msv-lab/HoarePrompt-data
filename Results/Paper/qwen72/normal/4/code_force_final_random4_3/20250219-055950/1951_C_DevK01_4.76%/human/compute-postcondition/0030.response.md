Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m` and `k` is `L[2]`.
- `n` is the length of `N`.
- The other variables (`L`, `t`, `M`, `k`, `q`, `N`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `cost` is now a specific value based on the given formula and the values of `m`, `N`, and `n`.
