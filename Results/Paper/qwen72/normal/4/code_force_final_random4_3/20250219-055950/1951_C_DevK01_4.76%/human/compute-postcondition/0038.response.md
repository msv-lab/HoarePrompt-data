Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the first `q` elements of `M`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged, and the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `L`, `t`, `M`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `n`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
