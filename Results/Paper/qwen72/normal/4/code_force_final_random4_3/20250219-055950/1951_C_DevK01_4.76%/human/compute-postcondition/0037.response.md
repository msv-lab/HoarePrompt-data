Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
- `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1).
- `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

### Conditions and Calculations:
1. **If `n * m == k`:**
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

2. **Otherwise:**
   - `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element.
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element.
   - `w` is the last element of the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
   - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `m` and `k`:**
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.

2. **Calculate `q`:**
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

3. **Determine `N` and `n`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - If `n * m != k`, then:
     - `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element.
     - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element.
     - `w` is the last element of the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

4. **Calculate `cost`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Final Output:
The `print(cost)` statement will print the calculated value of `cost` based on the conditions and calculations described above. Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, we can describe the value of `cost` in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated as described in the conditions and formulas provided in the initial state)**
