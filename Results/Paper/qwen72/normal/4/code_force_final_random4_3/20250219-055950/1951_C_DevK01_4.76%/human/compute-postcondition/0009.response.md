Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is now assigned the value of the length of `N`.
- `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `k` is equal to `L[2]`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input.
- `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
