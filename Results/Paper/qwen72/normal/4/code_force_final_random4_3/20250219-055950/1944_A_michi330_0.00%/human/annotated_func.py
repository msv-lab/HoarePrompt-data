#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n` and `k` and should be defined as `def func(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `t`, `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function also retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n - 1`. After processing all test cases, the function retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` but does not return any value.
