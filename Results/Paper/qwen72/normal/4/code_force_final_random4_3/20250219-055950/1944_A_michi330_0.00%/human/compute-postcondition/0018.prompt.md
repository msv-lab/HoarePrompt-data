Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n` and `k` and should be defined as `def func(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, t, 1):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k >= n - 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(n - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function also retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. Otherwise, the program also retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
