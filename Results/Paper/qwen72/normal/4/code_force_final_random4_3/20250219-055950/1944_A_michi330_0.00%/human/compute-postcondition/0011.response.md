Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(n - 1)
```

This statement will print the value of `n` minus 1. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `n` is not specified, but we know it is an integer. Therefore, the output will be the result of subtracting 1 from the input integer `n`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the input integer)**
