The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and the list `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be within the range of `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is 1
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least one element. Since `x` is 1, the next value for `x` will be 2. For the loop to continue, `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.**
