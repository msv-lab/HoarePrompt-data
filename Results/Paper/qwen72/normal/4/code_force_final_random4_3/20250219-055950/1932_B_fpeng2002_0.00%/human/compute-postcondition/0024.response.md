Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
- The calculation `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]` ensures that `start_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of `nums[2]` after `start_year`.
- All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
