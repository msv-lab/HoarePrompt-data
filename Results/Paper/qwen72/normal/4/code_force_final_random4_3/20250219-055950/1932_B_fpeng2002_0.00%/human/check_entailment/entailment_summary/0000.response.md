Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, which is the year when all signs have occurred sequentially according to their periodicities. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and a list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year**: 
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur by using the formula:
     \[
     \text{start_year} = \left(\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the final `start_year` for each test case, which is the year when the n-th sign will occur.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Signs: 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18
  - Initial `start_year` = 0
  - First sign: 3 (next multiple of 3 after 0 is 3)
  - Second sign: 4 (next multiple of 2 after 3 is 4)
  - Third sign: 8 (next multiple of 4 after 4 is 8)
  - Fourth sign: 10 (next multiple of 5 after 8 is 10)
  - Fifth sign: 18 (next multiple of 9 after 10 is 18)
  - Sixth sign: 36 (next multiple of 18 after 18 is 36)
  - Output: 36 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Signs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  - Initial `start_year` = 0
  - First sign: 1 (next multiple of 1 after 0 is 1)
  - Second sign: 2 (next multiple of 2 after 1 is 2)
  - Third sign: 3 (next multiple of 3 after 2 is 3)
  - Fourth sign: 4 (next multiple of 4 after 3 is 4)
  - Fifth sign: 5 (next multiple of 5 after 4 is 5)
  - Output: 5 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Signs: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
  - Initial `start_year` = 0
  - First sign: 1 (next multiple of 1 after 0 is 1)
  - Second sign: 2 (next multiple of 1 after 1 is 2)
  - Third sign: 3 (next multiple of 1 after 2 is 3)
  - Fourth sign: 4 (next multiple of 1 after 3 is 4)
  - Fifth sign: 5 (next multiple of 1 after 4 is 5)
  - Output: 5 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Signs: 50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006
  - Initial `start_year` = 0
  - First sign: 50 (next multiple of 50 after 0 is 50)
  - Second sign: 90 (next multiple of 30 after 50 is 90)
  - Third sign: 711 (next multiple of 711 after 90 is 711)
  - Fourth sign: 1010 (next multiple of 200 after 711 is 1000, but since 711 + 1 = 712, the next multiple is 1010)
  - Fifth sign: 1512 (next multiple of 503 after 1010 is 1512)
  - Sixth sign: 2012 (next multiple of 1006 after 1512 is 2012)
  - Output: 2012 (Correct)

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
