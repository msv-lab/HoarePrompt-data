You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, t is in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration plus 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year in which the signs occur sequentially.

3. **Loop Through Signs**: The program iterates through the list of periodicities `nums` using a for loop. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign.

4. **Calculation**:
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` performs integer division to find the number of complete cycles of the current sign's periodicity that fit into the current `start_year + 1`.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` multiplies by the periodicity to get the actual year when the next sign will occur.

5. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - For `a_1 = 3`: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For `a_2 = 2`: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - For `a_3 = 4`: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - For `a_4 = 5`: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - For `a_5 = 9`: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - For `a_6 = 18`: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - For `a_1 = 1`: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For `a_2 = 2`: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - For `a_3 = 3`: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For `a_4 = 4`: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - For `a_5 = 5`: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - For `a_1 = 1`: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For `a_2 = 1`: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
  - For `a_3 = 1`: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
  - For `a_4 = 1`: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
  - For `a_5 = 1`: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 4**:
  - `n = 6`, `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - For `a_1 = 50`: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - For `a_2 = 30`: `start_year = ((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
  - For `a_3 = 711`: `start_year = ((60 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - For `a_4 = 200`: `start_year = ((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
  - For `a_5 = 503`: `start_year = ((800 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - For `a_6 = 1006`: `start_year = ((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
