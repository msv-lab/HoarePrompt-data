The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user. It then calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of each integer in the list and is greater than or equal to the previous year plus one. The function prints the calculated year for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `num_tests` being 0. The function does not return any value.
