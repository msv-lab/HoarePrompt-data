Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually by reading the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year just before the first sign occurs.

3. **Loop Through Signs**: The program iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`.

4. **Calculate Next Year**: For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur after the previous signs have occurred. This is done using the formula:
   \[
   \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\text{start\_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x]
   \]
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
   - The integer division `//` and addition `+ 1` find the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[x]}\).
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.

5. **Output**: After processing all signs, it prints the year in which the last sign occurs.

This approach ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous sign, and the final year is the year in which the last sign occurs, which is the year of the apocalypse. The program handles all the constraints and edge cases correctly, as demonstrated by the example inputs and outputs.
