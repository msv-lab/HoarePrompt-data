The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least one more element for the loop to continue. Therefore, `x` becomes 2, and `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than `nums[0]`**
