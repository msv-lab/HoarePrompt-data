Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
   - This means `num_tests` can be any integer from 0 to 999.
2. `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - This is consistent with the range of `t`.
3. `n` is an input integer.
   - The value of `n` is not specified, but it is an integer provided by the user.
4. `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.
   - This means `nums` is a non-empty list of integers.
5. `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`.
   - This formula is used to calculate `start_year` based on the last element of the `nums` list.
6. `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `x` is the index of the last element in the `nums` list.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(start_year)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `x`**:
   - `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the `nums` list.
   - Let's denote the last element of `nums` as `nums[x]` or `nums[-1]`.

2. **Calculate `start_year`**:
   - The formula for `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This formula ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

3. **Initial Value of `start_year`**:
   - The initial value of `start_year` is not explicitly provided, but we can assume it is some integer value.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `start_year` as `start_year_initial`.

4. **Apply the Formula**:
   - `start_year = ((start_year_initial + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This formula rounds `start_year_initial` up to the next multiple of `nums[x]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `nums = [10, 20, 30]` and `start_year_initial = 100`.

1. **Determine `x`**:
   - `x = len(nums) - 1 = 2`.

2. **Calculate `start_year`**:
   - `nums[x] = nums[2] = 30`.
   - `start_year = ((100 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30`.
   - `start_year = (101 // 30 + 1) * 30`.
   - `101 // 30 = 3` (integer division).
   - `start_year = (3 + 1) * 30`.
   - `start_year = 4 * 30`.
   - `start_year = 120`.

### General Description:
- The `start_year` is calculated to be the smallest multiple of the last element in the `nums` list that is greater than the initial value of `start_year`.
- Since the exact initial value of `start_year` is not provided, the output will depend on the initial value and the last element of the `nums` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of the last element in the `nums` list that is greater than the initial value of `start_year`)**
