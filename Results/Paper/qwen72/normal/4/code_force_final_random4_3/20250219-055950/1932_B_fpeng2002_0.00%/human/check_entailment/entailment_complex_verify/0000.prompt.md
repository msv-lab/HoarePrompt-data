You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, t is in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration plus 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user. It then calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of each integer in the list and is greater than or equal to the previous year plus one. The function prints the calculated year for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `num_tests` being 0. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign will occur.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: It iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`.
4. **Calculate Next Year**: For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign. This is done using the formula:
   ```python
   start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` finds the number of complete cycles of the sign's periodicity that have occurred up to the current year.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the year of the next occurrence of the sign.

5. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- **Single Sign (n = 1)**: The program will correctly return the year `nums[0]` for a single sign.
- **Multiple Signs**: The program correctly calculates the year for each subsequent sign, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- **Large Periodicities**: The program can handle large periodicities up to \(10^6\) and multiple test cases up to 1000.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented in the program, it appears to be correct for all potential cases.
