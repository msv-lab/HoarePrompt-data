Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration plus 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `num_tests` remains `t - 3`, where `t` is still within the range of 3 to 1000, and `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `n` remains the new input integer provided by the user.
- The variable `nums` remains the list of integers provided by the user, which must have at least one element.
- The variable `x` is now equal to `len(nums) - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list `nums`.
- The variable `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` (`nums[len(nums) - 1]`) that is greater than or equal to the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration plus 1. This means that `start_year` has been adjusted to align with the multiples of each element in `nums` in sequence, starting from the first element.
