Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges, `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`. Additionally, `d[x]` is less than `A`.**
