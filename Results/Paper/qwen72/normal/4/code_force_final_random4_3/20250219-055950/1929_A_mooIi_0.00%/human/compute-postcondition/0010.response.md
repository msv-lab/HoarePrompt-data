Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, and `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.
- The provided code snippet reassigns `ar` to a new map object that converts a sorted list of integers from the input into strings.
- Since the code snippet is the same as the one in the initial state, `ar` remains a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.
- The values of `_` and `n` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
