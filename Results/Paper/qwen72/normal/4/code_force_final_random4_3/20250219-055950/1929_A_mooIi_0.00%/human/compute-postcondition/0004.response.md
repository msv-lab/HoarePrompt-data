The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.**
