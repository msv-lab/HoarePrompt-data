Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order, because this maximizes the positive differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program does not calculate the beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements. This does not match the expected output, which should be a single integer representing the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
3. Print this sum for each test case.

Given that the program only sorts and prints the elements, it is not solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
