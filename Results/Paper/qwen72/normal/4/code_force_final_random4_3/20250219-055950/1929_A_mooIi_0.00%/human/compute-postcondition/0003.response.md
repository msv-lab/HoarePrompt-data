Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(ar))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ar` is a map object. This means it is the result of applying a function (in this case, `str`) to each element of a list.
   - The list in question is a sorted list of integers from the input.
   - The `map` function converts each integer in the sorted list to a string.
   - The `join` method is then used to concatenate these string elements into a single string, with each element separated by a space.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `ar` is a map object that converts each integer in the sorted list to a string, the `join` method will join these string representations of the integers.
   - For example, if the input list of integers is `[5, 3, 1, 4, 2]`, the sorted list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - After converting each integer to a string, the list would be `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.
   - The `join` method would then produce the string `'1 2 3 4 5'`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string formed by joining the string representations of the sorted integers from the input list, separated by spaces.

Output: **' '.join(ar) (where ar is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings)**

To make it more precise and human-readable:
Output: **a space-separated string of the sorted integers from the input list, converted to strings**
