You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 100`) and a list of `n` integers. It sorts these integers in ascending order, converts them to strings, and prints them separated by spaces. The function does not return any value; it only performs the described input and output operations. After the function concludes, the program state is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and the sorted lists of integers for each test case have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last element: \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array and then prints the sorted array elements as strings.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The program does not calculate the beauty of the array.
   - The program prints the sorted array elements, which is not the required output.
   - The required output is a single integer representing the maximum beauty of the array.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - After sorting the array, the maximum beauty can be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The correct output should be the calculated beauty, not the sorted array elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It sorts the array and prints the elements, but it does not calculate and output the maximum beauty of the array.

### Correctness:
**False**
