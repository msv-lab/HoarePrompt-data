### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last element: \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array and then prints the sorted array elements as strings.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The program does not calculate the beauty of the array.
   - The program prints the sorted array elements, which is not the required output.
   - The required output is a single integer representing the maximum beauty of the array.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - After sorting the array, the maximum beauty can be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The correct output should be the calculated beauty, not the sorted array elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It sorts the array and prints the elements, but it does not calculate and output the maximum beauty of the array.

### Correctness:
**False**
