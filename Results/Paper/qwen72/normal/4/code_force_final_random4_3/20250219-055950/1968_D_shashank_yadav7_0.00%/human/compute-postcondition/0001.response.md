The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `i` at the start of the loop should be 0, as the `range(t)` function starts from 0 and goes up to `t-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each testcase, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `p` is a permutation of length `n`.
- `a` is an array of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of values of `n` over all testcases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is at least 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
