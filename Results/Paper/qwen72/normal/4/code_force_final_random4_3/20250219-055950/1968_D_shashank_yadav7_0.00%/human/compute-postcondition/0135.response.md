Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`**

Explanation:
- `k` is decreased by 1, so the new value of `k` is `k - 1`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain the same as they were in the initial state, but their updates are still valid and should be included in the output state.
