Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so `k` is now -3.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet `k -= 1`.
