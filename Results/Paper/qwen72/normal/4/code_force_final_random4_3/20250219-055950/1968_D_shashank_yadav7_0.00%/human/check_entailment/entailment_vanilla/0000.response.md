### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Positions:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is appropriate for Python lists.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

4. **Score Calculation Loop:**
   - The loop runs for `k` turns, but the loop variable `i` is not used effectively.
   - The loop decrements `k` by 1 on each iteration, which is unnecessary since the loop already runs `k` times.
   - The loop updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by moving them to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively. This is incorrect because `p` is 0-based indexed, so subtracting 1 is not needed.
   - The loop calculates the scores `bm` and `sm` by adding the maximum of the current score and a calculated value. This logic is flawed and does not follow the rules of the game.

5. **Score Update:**
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are updated by adding the corresponding values from `a` at the current positions `b` and `s`.
   - However, the logic for updating `bm` and `sm` is incorrect and does not reflect the game rules.

6. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program compares the final scores `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - This comparison is based on the incorrect score calculation logic.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it does not follow the rules of the game correctly. Specifically, the score calculation logic is flawed, and the position updates are incorrect due to the unnecessary subtraction of 1.

**Correctness: False**
