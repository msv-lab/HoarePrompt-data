### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Initial Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions in the array `a`.

4. **Score Calculation Loop:**
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation `p`.
   - It then updates their scores by adding the corresponding values from the array `a`.

5. **Score Update Logic:**
   - The original program contains a significant logical error in the score update loop. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     These lines are incorrect because they do not follow the rules of the game. According to the problem description, the score for each player should simply be incremented by the value at their current position in the array `a` during each turn. The `max` function and the multiplication by `k` are not part of the game rules and lead to incorrect score calculations.

6. **Final Score Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bodya_score = a[b]
        sasha_score = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Score Calculation:**
  - `bodya_score` and `sasha_score` are initialized with the values at their starting positions in the array `a`.
- **Score Update Loop:**
  - The loop runs `k-1` times (since the initial score is already added).
  - In each iteration, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated according to the permutation `p`.
  - The scores are updated by adding the value at the new position in the array `a`.
- **Final Score Comparison:**
  - After the loop, the scores are compared, and the result is printed.

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the score update loop, specifically the use of `max` and multiplication by `k`.
- The corrected program follows the rules of the game correctly and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect. The corrected program is provided above.)
