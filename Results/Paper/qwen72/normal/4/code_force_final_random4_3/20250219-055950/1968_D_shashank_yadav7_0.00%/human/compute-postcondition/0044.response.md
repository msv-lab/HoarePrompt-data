Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is `n - 1`.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `k` is an input integer minus `n`.
5. `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times).
6. `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times).
7. `p` is a list of integers.
8. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
9. `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations.
10. `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations.
11. `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations.
12. `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations.
13. `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state provides a complex set of conditions and calculations involving `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`.
- However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **Bodya**
