Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n`, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the condition `bm > sm` is true. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is false.**

Explanation:
- The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `p`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- The only change is that `p` now holds a list of integers provided by the user.
