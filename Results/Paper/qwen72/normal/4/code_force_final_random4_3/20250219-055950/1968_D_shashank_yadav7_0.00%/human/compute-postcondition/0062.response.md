The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and that `i` is initialized to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer minus `n`
- `b` is an input integer minus 1
- `s` is an input integer minus 1
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `sp` is the value at index `s` in the list `a`
- `bp` is the value at index `b` in the list `a`
- `bm` is the value of `a[b] * k`
- `sm` is the value of `a[s] * k`
- `bm` is greater than `sm` if the condition `bm > sm` is true. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is false.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
- `i` must be 0 (the starting index for the loop)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop runs at least once)

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
