Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each testcase, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. p is a permutation of length n, and a is an array of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
