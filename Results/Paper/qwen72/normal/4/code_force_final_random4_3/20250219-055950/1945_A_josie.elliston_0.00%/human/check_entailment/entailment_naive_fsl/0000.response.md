Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` is missing a critical check to ensure that the number of extroverts can be fully accommodated with the available universals. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- In this case, there is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal.
- The introvert must be in a tent alone, which requires 1 tent.
- The extrovert needs to be in a tent with 2 others, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a tent of 3 people.
- Therefore, it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, and the output should be -1.

However, the program incorrectly returns 1, which is incorrect. This indicates that the program does not handle this specific edge case correctly.
