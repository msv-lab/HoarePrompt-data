Output State: **The program returns -1 if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.** 

Here, `introverts` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and `universals` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. The value of `ret` is the result of the function `func_1(extroverts, universals)`. If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`, the program returns -1. If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns a value, the program returns the sum of `introverts` and that value.
