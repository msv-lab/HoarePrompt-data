Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the problem requires counting ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the function `func_15()` does not seem to correctly handle the condition involving the gcd. Instead, it appears to be counting pairs based on a different logic, which is not aligned with the problem description. For example, the loop condition `i * i <= n + i` and the way the answer is incremented `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not reflect the required condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
