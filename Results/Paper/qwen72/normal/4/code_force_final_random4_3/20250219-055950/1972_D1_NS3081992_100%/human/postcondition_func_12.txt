The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that if `b` is 0, the tuple is `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `(b, a % b)` and returns a new tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, but the exact purpose and the final state of `x`, `y`, and `g` depend on the recursive calls and the initial values of `a` and `b`.
