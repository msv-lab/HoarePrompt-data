Postcondition: ***`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()) and initially filled with zeros, `tmp` is 1000000000, `di` is the third element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between 1000000000 and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.***
