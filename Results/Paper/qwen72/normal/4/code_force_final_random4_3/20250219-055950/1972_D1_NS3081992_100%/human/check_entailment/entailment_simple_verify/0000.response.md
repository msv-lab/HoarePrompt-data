### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and the implementation to understand why:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Function `func_15()` Analysis:**
   - The function reads \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop where `i` is incremented until `i` is greater than `m` or `i * i` is greater than `n + i`.
   - Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Issues with `func_15()`:**
   - **Loop Condition:** The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem does not mention any condition involving \(i^2\) or \(n + i\).
   - **Increment Logic:** The increment logic `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` is also incorrect. This logic does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be counting something unrelated to the problem's conditions.
   - **GCD Calculation:** The function does not use the `gcd` function or any logic to calculate the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\), which is a crucial part of the problem's condition.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - A correct implementation would involve:
     - Reading \(n\) and \(m\).
     - Iterating over all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and all \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
     - For each pair \((a, b)\), calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\).
     - Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - Counting the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses an incorrect loop condition and increment logic, and it does not calculate the gcd or check the required condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
