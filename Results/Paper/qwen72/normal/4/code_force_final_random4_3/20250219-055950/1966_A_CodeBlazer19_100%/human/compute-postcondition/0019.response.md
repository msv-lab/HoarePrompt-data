Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `l` to a list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged.
- The postcondition remains the same as in the initial state, as the code only affects the value of `l`.
