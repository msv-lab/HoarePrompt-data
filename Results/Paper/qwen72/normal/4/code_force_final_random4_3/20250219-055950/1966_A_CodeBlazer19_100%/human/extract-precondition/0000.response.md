Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `cards` representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The list `cards` should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element in `cards` should be an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).**

However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(cards, k):
```

With the precondition:

**Precondition: **cards is a list of integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each element c_i in cards satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100. k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 100.**
