Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program follows the logic for the if part. Otherwise, if the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`, the program follows the logic for the else part.***
