To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only variable in the loop head is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three lines of input.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases and is guaranteed to be at least 1, we can assume that `int(input())` will be `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and that the loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 (as it is the first iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
