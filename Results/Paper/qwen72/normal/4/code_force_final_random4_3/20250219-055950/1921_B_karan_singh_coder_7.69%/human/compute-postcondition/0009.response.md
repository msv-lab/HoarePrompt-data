The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is different from `t[i]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `i` is 1**
