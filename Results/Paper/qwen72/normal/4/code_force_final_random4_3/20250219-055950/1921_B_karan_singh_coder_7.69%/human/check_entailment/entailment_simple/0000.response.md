### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state string `s`, and the desired state string `t`.

2. **Counting '1's:**
   - It counts the number of '1's in both the initial state `s` and the desired state `t` using `s1 = s.count('1')` and `t1 = t.count('1')`.

3. **Counting Differences:**
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0 and iterates over each character in the strings `s` and `t`.
   - For each position `i`, it increments `cnt` if the characters in `s` and `t` at position `i` are different. This counts the total number of positions where the states differ.

4. **Determining the Minimum Number of Operations:**
   - If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are the same (`s1 == t1`), the number of operations required is simply the number of positions where the states differ (`cnt`).
   - If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are different, it calculates the absolute difference `d` between the number of '1's in `s` and `t`.
   - The minimum number of operations required is then calculated as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`. This formula accounts for the fact that some differences can be resolved by moving cats, while others require adding or removing cats.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum number of operations for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - When `s1 == t1`, the number of '1's is the same, so the only operations needed are moves to align the cats. The number of moves is equal to the number of differing positions (`cnt`).
  - When `s1 != t1`, the difference `d` represents the number of cats that need to be added or removed. The remaining differences (`cnt - d`) can be resolved by moving cats, and each move resolves two differences (one '1' to '0' and one '0' to '1'). Thus, the number of moves required is `(cnt - d) // 2`, and the total operations are `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input and output, and the logic for calculating the minimum number of operations is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
