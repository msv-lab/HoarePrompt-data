The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 2, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 3, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`, otherwise `cnt` remains the same. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
