The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n - 1`, meaning `n` has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `n` is `n - 1`, `screen_require_for_y` remains the same, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` <= `remaining_cells`, `result` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, and if `space_x` % 15 == 0, `extra_screen` is equal to `x // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1`. The value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` has been appended to the list `result`.**
