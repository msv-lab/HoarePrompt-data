Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has a few logical errors that can lead to incorrect results:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons using `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. This is incorrect because each screen can fit up to 3 of the 2x2 icons (since a 5x3 grid has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so 15 / 4 = 3.75, which means up to 3 icons can fit on one screen).
   - The correct calculation should be `y // 3 + (y % 3 > 0)` to account for the fact that each screen can fit up to 3 of the 2x2 icons, and if there are any remaining 2x2 icons, an additional screen is needed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons using `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is incorrect because it assumes that each screen can only fit 2 of the 2x2 icons, which is not true.
   - The correct calculation should be `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` where `screen_require_for_y` is the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons, and `space_y` is the total space occupied by the 2x2 icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Extra Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the extra screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `extra_space // 15 + 1`. This is incorrect because it should be based on the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The correct calculation should be to determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells and then calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screen_require_for_y = y // 3 + (y % 3 > 0)
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining cells
        remaining_x = max(0, x - remaining_cells)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        extra_screen = remaining_x // 15 + (remaining_x % 15 > 0)
        # Total screens required
        total_screens = screen_require_for_y + extra_screen
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
