Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`.** 

The value of `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y` divided by 2, using integer division. Since `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` will be an integer. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
