Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `n` is `n - 1`, `screen_require_for_y` remains the same, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- All other variables (`n`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`) remain unchanged or retain their previous values and conditions.
