To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `result`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be modified for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99**
