Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `n` is `n - 1`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, `extra_space` is equal to `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `x // 15`.**

Explanation:
- `extra_screen` is assigned the value of `space_x // 15`.
- Since `space_x` is equal to `x`, `extra_screen` is equal to `x // 15`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
