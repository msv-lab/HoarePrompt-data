Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list. `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. If `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated as follows: if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15`; otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` and `space_x` is not divisible by 15.***
