Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is odd and the remaining space on the last screen is not utilized optimally. Specifically, the program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` when `y` is odd. This approach assumes that each 2x2 icon will occupy a full screen, which is not always the case. 

For example, consider the input `x = 1`, `y = 1`. The program will calculate:
- `screen_require_for_y = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
- `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
- `space_x = 1 * 1 = 1`
- Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it will append `1` to the result.

However, the correct output should be `1` because the 2x2 icon can be placed on the screen, and there will be enough space for the 1x1 icon. The program's logic for calculating the remaining space and the number of screens required is flawed.

Another example is `x = 11`, `y = 1`. The program will calculate:
- `screen_require_for_y = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
- `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
- `space_x = 11 * 1 = 11`
- Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it will append `1` to the result.

However, the correct output should be `2` because the 2x2 icon will occupy 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons, but 11 1x1 icons cannot fit into 11 cells on a single screen (since the 2x2 icon occupies a 2x2 block, not just 4 individual cells). Therefore, an additional screen is needed.

These examples show that the program does not correctly handle the placement of icons and the calculation of the required number of screens.
