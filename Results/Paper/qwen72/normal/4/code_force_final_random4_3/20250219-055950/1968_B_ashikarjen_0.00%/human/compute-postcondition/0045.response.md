Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i]` or `j == m`, and `j` is equal to `m`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `t`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition that `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i]` or `j == m`, and `j` is equal to `m` still holds true.
