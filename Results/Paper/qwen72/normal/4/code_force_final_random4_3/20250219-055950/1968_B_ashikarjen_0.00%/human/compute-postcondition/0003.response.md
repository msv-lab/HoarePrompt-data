Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `k` is 0.**

The variable `k` is initialized to 0, and the other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
