Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `k` is 0 or 1, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 1]` or `j == m` plus 3, and `b[j]` must be different from `a[i]` and `j` must be less than `m`**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1.
- The initial state specifies that `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 1]` or `j == m` plus 2. After incrementing `j` by 1, `j` becomes the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 1]` or `j == m` plus 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
