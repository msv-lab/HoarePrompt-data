The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 2]` or `j == m`. If `j < m`, `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is set to 2. If `j >= m`, `k` is 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is `i + 1`**
