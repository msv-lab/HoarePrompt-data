Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The function correctly reads the input for each test case, including the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, and the strings themselves.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `k` and `j` are initialized to 0. `k` will keep track of the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to traverse `b`.

3. **Loop through `a`**: The function uses a loop to iterate through each character of `a`. For each character `a[i]`, it uses a nested while loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from the current position `j`.

4. **Matching Characters**: If a match is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), `k` is incremented to reflect that the current character of `a` is part of the subsequence, and `j` is incremented to move to the next character in `b`.

5. **Breaking the Loop**: If `j` reaches the end of `b` without finding a match for `a[i]`, the loop breaks, as no further characters in `a` can be part of the subsequence in `b`.

6. **Output**: The function prints the value of `k` for each test case, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

7. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `b` does not contain any '1' (as in the sixth example), or when the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b` (as in the fifth example).

8. **Constraints**: The function efficiently handles the constraints, ensuring that it can process up to \(10^4\) test cases and strings of length up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
