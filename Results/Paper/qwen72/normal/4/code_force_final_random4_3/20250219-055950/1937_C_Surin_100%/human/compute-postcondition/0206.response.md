Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 2. If `r` is `=`, `r2` is an input string, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 2. Otherwise, if `r` is not `>` and not `=`, the state of `r2` and `prev` remains unchanged.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` has no impact on the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `r`, `r2`, or `prev`. However, it ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which is already part of the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
