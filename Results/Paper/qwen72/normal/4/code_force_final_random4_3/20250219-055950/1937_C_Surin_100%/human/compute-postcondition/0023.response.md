Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v2` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `r` is the input string provided by the user. If the user inputs '<', the current value of `r` is '<'. Otherwise, the value of `r` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - The f-string contains the following elements:
     - A literal string `? `.
     - The value of `v1` is 1.
     - The value of `v1` is 1 (repeated).
     - The value of `v2` is 3.
     - The value of `v2` is 3 (repeated).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The f-string will be formatted with the values of `v1` and `v2`.
   - Therefore, the output will be: `? 1 1 3 3`.

5. **Final Output:**
   Output: **? 1 1 3 3**
