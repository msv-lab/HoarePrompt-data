Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`.
   - `kp` is `kp + 1`.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the final input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`.
   - `v1` depends on the value of `r`:
     - If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`.
   - `v1` is either `n-1` or the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

Given the initial state, we can summarize the output as follows:

- `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`.
- `v1` is `n-1` if the previous `r` was `<`, otherwise it is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

Since the exact values of `prev` and `v1` depend on the specific values of `r` and the iterations, we can only describe them in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where [prev] is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, and [v1] is `n-1` if the previous `r` was `<`, otherwise it is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`)**
