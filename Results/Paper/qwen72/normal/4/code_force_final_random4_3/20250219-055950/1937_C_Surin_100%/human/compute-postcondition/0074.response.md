Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`.**

The value of `n` is updated to the input integer, which must be greater than `kp + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `prev`, and `kp`) and the state of the output buffer remain unchanged.
