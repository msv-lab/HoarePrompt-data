Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `r` is an input string, `r2` is a new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Since `i` is 2, `prev` is now 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
