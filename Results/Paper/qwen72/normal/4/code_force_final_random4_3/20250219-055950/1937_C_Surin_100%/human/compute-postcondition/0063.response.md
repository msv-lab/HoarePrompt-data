Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this doesn't affect the value of the variables being printed).
   - `prev` remains unchanged (we don't have an explicit value for `prev`, so we will use the variable name).
   - `r` is an input string (this is not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` remains unchanged, so we will use `prev` in the output.

4. **Formatted Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string that starts with `?`.
   - It will then print the value of `i` twice, which is 3.
   - It will then print the value of `prev` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 3 3 prev prev (where prev is the unchanged value of the variable `prev`)**
