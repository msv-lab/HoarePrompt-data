Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: The input integer `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than `kp + 1`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`prev`**: The variable `prev` will be the last value of `i` where the input `r` was either `>` or `=`. If `r` was never `>` or `=`, `prev` will remain `0`.
- **`kp`**: The variable `kp` remains `kp + 1` as it was not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: The variable `g` remains `0` as it was not modified within the loop.
- **`v2`**: The variable `v2` remains `n-1` as it was not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: The variable `r` will be the final input string received after the last iteration of the loop.
- **`v1`**: The variable `v1` will be `n-1` if the last `r` was `<`. Otherwise, `v1` will be the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
