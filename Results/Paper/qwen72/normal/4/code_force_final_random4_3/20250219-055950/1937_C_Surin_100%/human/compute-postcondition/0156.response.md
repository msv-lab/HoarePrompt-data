The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 1, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and if `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**
