Based on the initial state provided:

- `kp` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `v2` is 1

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's break down the values of the variables used in the print statement:

- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 1

So, the print statement will substitute these values into the formatted string:

```
? 0 0 1 1
```

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
