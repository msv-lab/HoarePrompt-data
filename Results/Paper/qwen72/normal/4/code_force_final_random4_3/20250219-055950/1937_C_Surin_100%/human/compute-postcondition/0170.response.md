Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and `v1` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `<` or 0 if `r` was never `<`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: The input integer `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`prev`**: This variable remains the last value of `i` where the input string `r` was `>` or `=`.
- **`kp`**: This variable remains `kp + 2` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: This variable remains `0` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`v2`**: After the loop completes, `v2` will be `n-1` because it is set to the current value of `i` in each iteration.
- **`r`**: This is the final input string provided by the user during the last iteration of the loop.
- **`v1`**: This variable will be the last value of `i` where the input string `r` was `<`. If `r` was never `<` during any iteration, `v1` will remain `0`.
- **Output Buffer**: The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration, so it remains flushed after the loop completes.
