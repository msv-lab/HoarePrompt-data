### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\), which represents the size of the permutation.

3. **First Query Loop**:
   - The function initializes `v1` to 0.
   - It iterates over all indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it queries the comparison between \((p_0 \mid p_0)\) and \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to \(i\).
   - This loop effectively finds the index \(v1\) such that \(p_{v1}\) is the maximum value in the permutation.

4. **Second Query Loop**:
   - The function initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It iterates over all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) again.
   - For each index \(i\), it queries the comparison between \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) and \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\).
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to \(i\).
   - If the result is `=`, it makes an additional query to compare \((p_i \mid p_i)\) and \((p_{prev} \mid p_{prev})\).
   - If the result of the additional query is `<`, it updates `prev` to \(i\).
   - This loop effectively finds the index `prev` such that \(p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1}\) is maximized.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loops, the function prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the answer.
   - The output is flushed to ensure it is sent to the interactor.

6. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes \(n-1\) queries, and potentially \(n-1\) additional queries in the worst case.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \(2(n-1) + (n-1) = 3(n-1)\), which is within the limit of \(3n\) queries.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation using the first loop.
- The second loop correctly identifies the index `prev` such that \(p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1}\) is maximized.
- The program ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
