The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `range(1, n)`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and does not need to be adjusted manually.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The other variables (`kp`, `g`, `v1`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1**
