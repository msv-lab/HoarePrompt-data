Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**

The code snippet `r = input('')` updates the value of `r` to a new input string. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. If the new input string `r` is `<`, then `v1` will be set to 2. Otherwise, `v1` will remain 0. The initial state for `n`, `i`, `prev`, `kp`, `g`, and `v2` remains the same. The output buffer has been flushed, which is also part of the initial state and remains unchanged.
