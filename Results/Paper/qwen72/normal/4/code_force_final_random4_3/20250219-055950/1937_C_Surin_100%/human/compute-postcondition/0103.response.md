Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `<` at the last iteration, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains the same, with the only change being that the output buffer has been flushed.
