The `sys.stdout.flush()` command flushes the output buffer, but it does not change any of the variables in the program. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**
