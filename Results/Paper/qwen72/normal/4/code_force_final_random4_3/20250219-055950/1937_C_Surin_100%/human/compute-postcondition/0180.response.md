Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `r` is not equal to `>`.
   - The current value of `r` is `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, the print statement uses `prev` twice, suggesting that `prev` must be a variable that has been defined earlier in the code. Since `r` is the current value and `r` is `=`, it is reasonable to infer that `prev` might be the previous value of `r` or some other variable that has been set before this print statement. Without more context, we can only assume that `prev` has some value, but we don't know what it is.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a formatted string.
   - The string starts with `?` followed by the values of `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`.
   - `i` is 1, so the first two values will be `1`.
   - `prev` is not explicitly defined, so we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe it as the value of `prev`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 [prev] [prev]`, where `[prev]` is the value of the variable `prev`.

Output: **? 1 1 [prev] [prev] (where [prev] is the value of the variable `prev`)**
