The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., greater than 3).

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `prev` is 0, 1, or 2, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is updated to 2. If `r` is `=`, `prev` is updated to 2. If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains 0 or 1.**
