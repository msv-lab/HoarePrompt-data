Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `prev` is 0, 1, or 2, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is updated to 2. If `r` is `=`, `prev` is updated to 2. If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains 0 or 1.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` only affects the output buffer, which is already mentioned as being flushed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the output buffer remains flushed.
