Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` remains unchanged, `r` is an input string. If `r` == '>', `prev` is set to 2. If `r` == '=' and `r2` == '<', `prev` is set to 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `prev`, or `r`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, except for the confirmation that the output buffer has been flushed.
