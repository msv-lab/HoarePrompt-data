Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `I` is now defined as a lambda function that reads input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function `R` is now defined as a lambda function that reads input and converts it to an integer.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
        elif r == '=':
            print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r2 = input('')
            if r2 == '<':
                prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `r` is the final input string, and `v1` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `<` or 0 if `r` was never `<`. The output buffer has been flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
