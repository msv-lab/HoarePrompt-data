Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, except for the fact that the output buffer has been flushed.
