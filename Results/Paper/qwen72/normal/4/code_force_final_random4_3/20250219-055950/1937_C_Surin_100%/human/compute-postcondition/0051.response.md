Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is not relevant to the print statement itself).
   - `prev` remains unchanged (this means `prev` is some value that has not been modified).
   - `r` is an input string (this is not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')`.

3. **Values of Variables:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` remains unchanged, so its value is whatever it was before the print statement. Since the initial state does not specify an explicit value for `prev`, we can only refer to it as `prev`.

4. **Formatted String:**
   - The string to be printed is `f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}'`.
   - Substituting the values, we get: `f'? 2 2 {prev} {prev}'`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `? 2 2 {prev} {prev}` where `{prev}` is the value of `prev`.

Output: **? 2 2 {prev} {prev} (where {prev} is the value of `prev`)**
