Functionality: ** The function `func` operates in an interactive environment to determine two indices, `prev` and `v1`, based on the bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). The function processes multiple test cases, each with a different value of n. For each test case, it makes at most 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR results. After processing all test cases, the function prints the final result as `! {prev} {v1}` for each case, where `prev` is the last value of `i` where the comparison result was `>` or `=`, and `v1` is the last value of `i` where the comparison result was `<` or 0 if no such `i` was found. The function ensures that the output buffer is flushed after each query and the final result. **
