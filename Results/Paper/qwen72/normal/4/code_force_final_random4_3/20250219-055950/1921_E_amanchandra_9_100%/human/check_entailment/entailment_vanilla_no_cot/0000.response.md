Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are used inconsistently. `a` and `b` should represent Alice's initial position, and `c` and `d` should represent Bob's initial position. However, the logic in the solution seems to mix these variables, leading to potential errors.

2. **Winning Conditions**: The logic for determining the winner is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the conditions for checking if Alice or Bob can win are not accurate.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The solution does not correctly handle the boundary conditions for the board, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Optimal Play**: The solution does not fully account for the optimal play strategy of both players, which is crucial for determining the outcome of the game.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If Alice starts in the last row or Bob starts in the first row, it's a draw
        if x_a == h or x_b == 1:
            print('Draw')
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of moves until Alice and Bob are in the same row
        moves_until_same_row = (x_b - x_a) // 2
        
        # If the number of moves is odd, Alice will be the one to move into the same row
        if (x_b - x_a) % 2 == 1:
            # Check if Alice can move to Bob's column
            if abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves_until_same_row + 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Draw')
        else:
            # Check if Bob can move to Alice's column
            if abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves_until_same_row:
                print('Bob')
            else:
                print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initial Check for Draw**: If Alice is already in the last row (`x_a == h`) or Bob is already in the first row (`x_b == 1`), the game ends in a draw because neither can make a move.

2. **Calculate Moves Until Same Row**: The number of moves until Alice and Bob are in the same row is calculated as `(x_b - x_a) // 2`.

3. **Odd Number of Moves**: If the number of moves is odd, Alice will be the one to move into the same row. We check if Alice can move to Bob's column within the allowed moves. If she can, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

4. **Even Number of Moves**: If the number of moves is even, Bob will be the one to move into the same row. We check if Bob can move to Alice's column within the allowed moves. If he can, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

This corrected solution should handle all the cases correctly and determine the outcome of the game based on the optimal play strategy of both players.
