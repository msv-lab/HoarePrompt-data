Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where Alice and Bob's chips are initially in positions that allow one of them to win immediately. For example, if Alice's chip is at (x_a, y_a) = (1, 1) and Bob's chip is at (x_b, y_b) = (2, 2), Alice can move diagonally to (2, 2) and win on her first move. However, the program does not account for this and may incorrectly output "Draw" in such cases. Additionally, the logic for determining the winning conditions is flawed, as it does not correctly simulate the game's rules for all possible moves and positions.
