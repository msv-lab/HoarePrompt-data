### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the six integers `r, w, a, b, c, d` which represent the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program first checks if Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip (`a > c`). If this is true, the game will end in a draw because neither player can move into the other's position.

3. **Calculating the Number of Moves:**
   - If Alice's chip is not below Bob's chip, the program calculates the number of moves `x` that Alice can make to reach Bob's row. This is done using `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - The use of `abs(a - c) // 2` is correct because Alice and Bob move towards each other, and the number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's row is half the distance between their initial rows.

4. **Odd Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves `x` is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`), the program calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Alice can move to in Bob's row.
   - The range is calculated as `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`, which ensures that the columns are within the board boundaries.
   - The program then checks if Alice's chip can be moved to a column within this range such that it can capture Bob's chip. This is done using the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - If this condition is true, Alice wins. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.

5. **Even Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves `x` is even, the program calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Bob can move to in Alice's row.
   - The range is calculated as `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`, which ensures that the columns are within the board boundaries.
   - The program then checks if Bob's chip can be moved to a column within this range such that it can capture Alice's chip. This is done using the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.
   - If this condition is true, Bob wins. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the conditions checked.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given problem description. The conditions for winning and drawing are correctly implemented, and the program ensures that the moves are within the board boundaries.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
