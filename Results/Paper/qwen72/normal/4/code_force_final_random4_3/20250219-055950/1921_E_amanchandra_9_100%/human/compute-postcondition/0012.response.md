Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, with conditions `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`. `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are new variables assigned the values from the input split by spaces, where `r` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, and `d` is an integer, and `a` is less than or equal to `c`. `x` is assigned the value `abs(a - c) // 2`. Additionally, `abs(a - c)` is even. `l` is assigned the value `max(1, b - x)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is calculated as `max(1, b - x)`.
- `x` is already defined as `abs(a - c) // 2`.
- `b` is an integer input.
- The value of `l` will be the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
