Output State: **`r`, `w`, `b`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. `a` and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input. `x` is assigned the value `(abs(a - c) // 2)`.** 

In natural language: The values of `r`, `w`, `b`, and `d` remain unchanged. The value of `_` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than `t` for the loop to continue. The values of `a` and `c` are the integer values provided as input. The variable `x` is now assigned the value of the floor division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2.
