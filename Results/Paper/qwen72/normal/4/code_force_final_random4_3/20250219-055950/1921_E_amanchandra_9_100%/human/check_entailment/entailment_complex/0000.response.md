Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the game problem where Alice and Bob take turns moving their chips on a checkered board, with Alice moving down and Bob moving up. The goal is to determine the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect. It should take parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. The correct definition should be:
     ```python
     def func(t, h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):
     ```

2. **Variable Naming**:
   - The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are used to store the board dimensions and chip positions. However, these names do not match the problem description. The correct names should be `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` respectively:
     ```python
     h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
     ```

3. **Logic for Determining the Outcome**:
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip (`a > c`). If so, it prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up to Bob's row.
   - If Alice's chip is on or above Bob's chip (`a <= c`), it calculates `x` as the integer division of the absolute difference between `x_a` and `x_b` by 2.
   - If the difference in rows is odd, it checks if Alice can move to a position within a certain range of Bob's column. If so, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - If the difference in rows is even, it checks if Bob can move to a position within a certain range of Alice's column. If so, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Correctness of the Logic:

- **Initial Draw Condition**:
  - If `x_a > x_b`, Alice cannot move up to Bob's row, so the game will end in a draw. This is correct.

- **Odd Difference in Rows**:
  - If the difference in rows is odd, the program calculates `x` and then checks if Alice can move to a position within `x + 1` cells of Bob's column. This is because Alice will be the one to make the final move if the difference is odd. The logic here is correct.

- **Even Difference in Rows**:
  - If the difference in rows is even, the program calculates `x` and then checks if Bob can move to a position within `x` cells of Alice's column. This is because Bob will be the one to make the final move if the difference is even. The logic here is also correct.

### Conclusion:

Despite the issues with the function definition and variable naming, the core logic of the program is correct. If the function definition and variable names are corrected, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issues with the function definition and variable naming. These issues need to be fixed for the program to correctly solve the problem.
