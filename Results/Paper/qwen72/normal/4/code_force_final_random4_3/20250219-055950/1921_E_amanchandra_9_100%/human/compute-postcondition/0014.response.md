Let's break down the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed based on the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
- `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, with conditions `1 <= h <= 10^6` and `1 <= w <= 10^9`.
- `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, with conditions `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h` and `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.
- `r` is assigned the value `min(w, b + x)`.
- `w` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `c` is an integer.
- `d` is an integer.
- `a` is less than or equal to `c`.
- `x` is assigned the value `abs(a - c) // 2`.
- `abs(a - c)` is even.
- `l` is assigned the value `max(1, b - x)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`**:
   - `x` is defined as `abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - Since `abs(a - c)` is even, `x` will be an integer.

2. **Calculate `l`**:
   - `l` is defined as `max(1, b - x)`.
   - This ensures that `l` is at least 1, and it is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`**:
   - `r` is defined as `min(w, b + x)`.
   - This ensures that `r` is at most `w`, and it is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - The condition in the print statement is `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.
   - This condition checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`, and if the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Determine the Output**:
   - If the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is true, the print statement will output `['Bob']`.
   - If the condition is false, the print statement will output `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output either `['Draw']` or `['Bob']` based on the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `w` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `l`, `r`, and `x`. However, the output will be one of the two lists based on the condition.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Bob'] (where the output is determined by the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`)**
