Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the program checks if each character in string `c` is not in `a` or `b` and immediately prints "YES" if it finds such a character, which is incorrect. The correct approach should involve constructing a template that satisfies the conditions for both `a` and `b` and then checking if `c` does not match this template.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for _ in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Initialize the template with lowercase characters
        template = [''] * slength
        
        # Construct the template based on a and b
        for i in range(slength):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template[i] = a[i].upper()
            else:
                template[i] = a[i]
        
        # Check if c matches the template
        matches = True
        for i in range(slength):
            if template[i].islower() and c[i] != template[i]:
                continue
            elif template[i].isupper() and c[i] == template[i].lower():
                continue
            else:
                matches = False
                break
        
        if matches:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Template Construction**:
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), which is a lowercase character.

2. **Template Matching**:
   - For each position `i`, check if `c[i]` matches the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must be the same.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If `c` matches the template, print "NO".
   - If `c` does not match the template, print "YES".

This approach ensures that the template is correctly constructed and that the matching conditions are properly checked.
