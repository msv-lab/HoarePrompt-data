The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse, starting from `n-1` and decrementing `i` by 1 until it reaches 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 0

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n-2` (since the loop decrements `i` by 1)
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is n-2**
