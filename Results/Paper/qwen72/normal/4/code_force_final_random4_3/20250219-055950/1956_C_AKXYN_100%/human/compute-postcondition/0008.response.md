The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be at least 2).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be at least 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 7, `i` is 2**
