Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is `'2 %d' % i`. Here, `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and it will be replaced by the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, this part will print `2 n`.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so each integer in the range will be printed as separate arguments.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will first print `2 n`, followed by the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the input integer n)**
