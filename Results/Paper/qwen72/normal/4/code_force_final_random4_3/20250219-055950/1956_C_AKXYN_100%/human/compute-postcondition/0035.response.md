Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1.
   - `i` is `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement uses string formatting to print the string `'1 %d'` where `%d` is replaced by the value of `i`.
   - `i` is set to `n` based on the initial state.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and prints each element separated by spaces.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The string `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted to `'1 n'` where `n` is the value of `n`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the string `'1 n'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**
