You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0

            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500). For each test case, it creates an `n x n` matrix where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates a result `res` as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The function prints `res` followed by `n` shifted left by 1 bit (i.e., `n * 2`). Additionally, it prints a series of formatted strings for each integer from `n` down to 1, each string containing the integer and a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), then set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), then set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since each row and each column will be filled with this permutation, the total sum will be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes a matrix \( mat \) with rows filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - It calculates the maximum sum \( res \) using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \). However, this formula is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it performs a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it performs a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Correctness of Operations:**
   - The operations are valid and will indeed fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in each row and column.
   - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Correctness of Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

### Conclusion:
The program performs the operations correctly to fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in each row and column, but the sum calculation is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
