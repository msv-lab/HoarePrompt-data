The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` is now `n - 1`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be greater than 0, so `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is `n - 1`**
