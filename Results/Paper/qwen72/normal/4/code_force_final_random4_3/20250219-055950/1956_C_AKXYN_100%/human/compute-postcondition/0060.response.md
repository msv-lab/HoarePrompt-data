Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `i` is \(n-1\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is `'1 %d' % i`. This is a formatted string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - `i` is \(n-1\), so the string will be `'1 %d' % (n-1)`, which simplifies to `'1 n-1'`.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This unpacks the range of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'1 n-1'` followed by the unpacked range of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output: **1 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and n-1 is the value of i)**
