Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using at most `2n` operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
     - Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
   - The maximum possible sum is `n^2 * (n + 1) / 2` because each element in the matrix can be any integer from 1 to `n`, and there are `n^2` elements.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes an `n x n` matrix with each row containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It calculates a result `res` using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It prints `res` and `2n` (which is `n << 1`).
   - It then prints `n` operations of Type 1 and `n` operations of Type 2, each applying the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to a row and a column, respectively.

3. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is used to calculate the sum. However, this formula does not match the expected maximum sum of `n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum should be:
     \[
     \text{max\_sum} = n^2 \times \frac{(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - For example, for `n = 2`, the correct maximum sum is `2^2 * (2 + 1) / 2 = 4 * 3 / 2 = 6`, but the program calculates `1 * 1 + 2 * 3 = 1 + 6 = 7`, which is incorrect.

4. **Operation Verification**:
   - The program prints `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to a row or a column.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix will be one of the integers from 1 to `n`, but it does not necessarily maximize the sum.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's calculation of the maximum sum is incorrect.
   - The operations themselves are valid and within the allowed limit, but they do not guarantee the maximum sum.

Correctness: **False**
