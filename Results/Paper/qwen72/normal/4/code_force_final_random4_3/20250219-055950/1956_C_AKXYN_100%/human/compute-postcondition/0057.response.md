Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is a formatted string `'1 %d' % i`. Here, `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and `i` is the value that will be inserted into this placeholder.
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, the formatted string will be `'1 %d' % n`, which will print `1` followed by the value of `n`.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print each element in the range separated by spaces.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `1` followed by the value of `n`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 [n] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [n] is the value of n and the sequence 1 2 3 ... [n] includes all integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
