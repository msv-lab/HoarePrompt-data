Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0, the loop will execute `int(input()) - 1` more times.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, but the other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The loop will still execute `int(input()) - 1` more times, where the new input is used to update `n`.
