Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:

- The variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. This is because the loop runs `t` times, and `t` is not modified within the loop.
- For each iteration of the loop, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0. This is true because `n` is read from input for each test case, and the loop body assumes `n` is a valid positive integer.
- The variable `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. This is because `mat` is initialized within the loop as a 2D list with each row containing integers from 1 to `n`.
- The variable `res` is the sum of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This is because `res` is computed within the loop by summing this expression for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `i` is 0 after the loop has completed. This is because the loop variable `i` is reset to 0 for each test case, and the loop does not modify `i` outside of its scope.

The loop will have printed the value of `res` followed by `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`) for each test case, and then for each `i` from `n` down to 1, it will have printed two lines: one starting with "1" and the other starting with "2", both followed by the value of `i` and the range of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. This process will repeat for each of the `t` test cases.
