Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least three elements, `q` is the third element in `ans`, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and an additional `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is not '0', '1', or '?', `temp` remains unchanged.***
