To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `ans`. The loop will execute if `ans` is not empty. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, `_`, `temp`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`
- `_` is 1
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`
- `r` is now explicitly an integer
- `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'
- `temp` is an empty set

To ensure the loop executes, `ans` must contain at least one element. The variable `q` will be the first element in `ans` when the loop starts.

State: **`ans` must be a non-empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`**
