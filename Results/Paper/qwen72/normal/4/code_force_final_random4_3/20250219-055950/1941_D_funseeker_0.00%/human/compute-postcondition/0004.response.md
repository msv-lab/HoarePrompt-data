Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.**

Explanation:
- `r` is now an integer value, converted from the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `_`, and `c`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
