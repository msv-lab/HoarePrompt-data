The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` unpacks the result of `func_1().split()` into the variables `r` and `c`. The function `func_1()` returns a string, which is then split into two parts, and these parts are assigned to `r` and `c`. The initial state variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `_` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `_` is 0, `r` and `c` are the two parts of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.**
