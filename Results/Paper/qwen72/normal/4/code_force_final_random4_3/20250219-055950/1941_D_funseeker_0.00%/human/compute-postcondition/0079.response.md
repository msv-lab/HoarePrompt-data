Functionality: ** The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It initializes a set `ans` with a single element `x`, where `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`. It then iterates `m` times, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000. In each iteration, it processes a pair `(r, c)` where `r` is an integer and `c` is a string. Based on the value of `c`, it updates `ans` to include all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. After the loop, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`. Finally, the function prints the size of `ans` and all elements in `ans`. **
