Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, `_` is 1, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `r` is now explicitly an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', or '?', `temp` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set `temp`, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
