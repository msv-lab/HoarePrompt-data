Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in the original `ans`. `temp` is an empty set. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` remains a set containing only the value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`, and `q` is the first element in `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least two elements, `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`, and `q` is the second element in `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least three elements, `q` is the third element in `ans`, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and an additional `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is not '0', '1', or '?', `temp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
