Output State: **`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` remains an empty set, `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`, and `q` is the first element in `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` remains an integer.
- `c` remains unchanged and is either '1' or '?'.
- `ans` remains a set that must contain at least one element.
- `temp` is a set that now contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is not '1' or '?', `temp` remains an empty set.
- `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- `m` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.
- `q` remains the first element in `ans`.
