Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, `_` is 1, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'.**

Explanation:
- The code `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts, assigning the first part to `r` and the second part to `c`.
- `r` is now an integer value of the first part of the string.
- `c` is now a string value, which can be '0', '1', or '?'.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged from the initial state.
