Output State: **`ans` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in the original `ans`. `temp` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in `ans`. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` is updated to be the same as the variable `temp`, which contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in the original `ans`. The variable `temp` remains unchanged and still holds the final set of values after all iterations. The variables `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` are not affected and remain the same as they were in the initial state.
