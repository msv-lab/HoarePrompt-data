Output State: **`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set containing all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in the original `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the unique values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains only the unique values `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `r` remains an integer, and `c` is unchanged. The set `ans` now contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each element `q` in the original `ans`. The set `temp` contains the unique values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains only the unique values `(q + r) % n`. The variables `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `m` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.
