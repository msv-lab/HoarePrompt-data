Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, for all iterations of the loop. If `0` is in `ans`, the value `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. `c`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` is the final value of the range, which is `m - 1`.***
