Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, for all iterations of the loop. `c`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` is the final value of the range, which is `m - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` retain their initial values as returned by `func_3()`.
- The set `ans` contains all unique values that result from performing the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` on each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c` (which can be '0', '1', or '?') for each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `c` and `r` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The loop counter `_` will have the value `m - 1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
