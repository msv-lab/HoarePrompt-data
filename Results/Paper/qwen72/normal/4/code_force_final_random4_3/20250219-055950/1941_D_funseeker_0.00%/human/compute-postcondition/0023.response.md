Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and all elements generated by the loop, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'. `temp` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, depending on the value of `c`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`, `m`, and `x`**: These values remain unchanged as they are determined by the initial call to `func_3()`.
- **`ans`**: This set initially contains the value of `x`. After the loop, it will contain all the elements that were generated by the loop, including the initial value of `x` and any new values added to `temp`.
- **`_`**: This variable remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: This value remains unchanged as it is determined by the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- **`c`**: This value remains unchanged as it is determined by the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- **`temp`**: This set will contain all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is '0' or '?', it will contain all unique values of `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', it will contain all unique values of both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

In summary, the loop will continue to generate new values and add them to `temp` until all elements in `ans` have been processed. The final state of `temp` will include all unique values generated by the loop based on the conditions specified by `c`.
