Output State: **`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in the original `ans`. `temp` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in `ans`. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`.**
