To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `b` and `c` are new input integers with their parities unchanged.
   - `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the program retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.
   - If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program also retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('YES')`.

Given the conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will always execute regardless of the values of `b` and `c`. The conditions only describe the state of `b` and `c` but do not affect the execution of the print statement. The print statement is a simple output of the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
