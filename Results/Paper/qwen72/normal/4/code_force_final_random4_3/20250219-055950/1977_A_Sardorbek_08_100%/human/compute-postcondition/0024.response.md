Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `q` is a tuple containing the new input integers `b` and `c`, `b` and `c` are updated to the new input values, and the parities of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the program retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal. If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program also retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.***
