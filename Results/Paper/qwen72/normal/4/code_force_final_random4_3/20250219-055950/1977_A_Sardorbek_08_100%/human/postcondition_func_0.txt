The function `func` reads a positive integer `a` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. The function then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If `b` and `c` have different parities and `b` is greater than `c`, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has processed `a` test cases and printed the corresponding results for each.
