The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes several variables and conditions:
  - `a` is a positive integer.
  - `i` is 0.
  - `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`.
  - `b` is not equal to `c`.
  - `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
  - Both `b` and `c` have the same parity (i.e., both are either even or both are odd).

- However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
