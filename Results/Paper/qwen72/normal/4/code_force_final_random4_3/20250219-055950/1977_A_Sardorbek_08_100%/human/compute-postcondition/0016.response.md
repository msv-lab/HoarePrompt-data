Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`. If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state. Otherwise, if `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`, and the parities of `b` and `c` (whether they are both even or both odd, or one is even and the other is odd) remain unchanged.***
