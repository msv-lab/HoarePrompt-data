You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `a` is a positive integer, `i` is `a-1`, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` containing the last input integers `b` and `c`. The parities of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state. If `b` is less than `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the program retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal. If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program also retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

3. **Conditions to Check:**
   - If `n` is equal to `m`, then Nikita can simply add one cube in each move to achieve exactly `m` cubes.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - If `n` is greater than `m`, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes must match the parity of the number of moves. If `n` and `m` have the same parity, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads `b` and `c` (which correspond to `n` and `m` in the problem description).
   - It checks the following conditions:
     - If `b` is equal to `c`, it prints 'YES'.
     - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (`b % 2 == c % 2`), it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is equal to `m`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `m`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than `m` and checks the parity.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' in the correct format, which is acceptable according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
