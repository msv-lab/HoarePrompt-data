Let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `q` is a tuple containing the new input integers `b` and `c`.
- `b` and `c` are updated to the new input values.
- The parities of `b` and `c` remain unchanged.
- If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state.
- Otherwise, if `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state describes the conditions and values of variables `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and the tuple `q`, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or the tuple `q`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
