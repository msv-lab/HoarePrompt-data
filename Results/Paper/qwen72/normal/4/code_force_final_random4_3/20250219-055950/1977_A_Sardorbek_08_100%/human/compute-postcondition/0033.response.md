Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` and `c` are new input integers with their parities unchanged.
- `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.

### Conditions:
- If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state.
- If `b` is less than `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`.
- If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the program retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.
- If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program also retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'No'`.
- The initial state and conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is a fixed string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
