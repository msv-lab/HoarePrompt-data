Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is a tuple containing the new input integers `b` and `c`.
   - `b` and `c` are updated to the new input values, and their parities (odd or even) remain unchanged.
   - If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state.
   - Otherwise, if `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is unconditional. It does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - Therefore, regardless of the values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`, the `print` statement will always execute and print the string 'YES'.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The output of the `print` statement will always be 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
