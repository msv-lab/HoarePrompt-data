Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a positive integer greater than 1.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `b` and `c` are new input integers with their parities unchanged.
4. `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.
5. If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state.
6. If `b` is less than `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`.
7. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the program retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.
8. If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program also retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state describes various conditions and states related to the variables `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and the tuple `q`, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
