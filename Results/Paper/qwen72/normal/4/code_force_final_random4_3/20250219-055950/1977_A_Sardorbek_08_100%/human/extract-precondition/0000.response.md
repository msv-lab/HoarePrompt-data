Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function definition should be updated to include the parameters `n` and `m`, and potentially a parameter for the number of test cases `t`. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
    # t is the number of test cases
    # test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (n, m)
```

For each test case, the function should determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves and output "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
