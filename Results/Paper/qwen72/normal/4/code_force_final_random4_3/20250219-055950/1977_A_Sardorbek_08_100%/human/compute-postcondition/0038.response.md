The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters. Assuming the function signature should include these parameters, the function would look like this:

```
def func(t, n, m):
```

Now, let's think step by step about what the function accepts and what it returns:

1. The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`.
2. `t` is the number of test cases and is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
3. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
4. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Since the specific output for each test case is not provided, we'll describe the functionality based on the parameters and the general structure:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases, a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100), `n` (a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 100), and `m` (a non-negative integer such that 1 <= m <= 100). It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.**
