Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of `x` integers. It then checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, the function prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, either `2` or `3` has been printed to the console. **
