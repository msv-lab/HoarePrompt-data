To ensure the for loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(n)` function and will start at 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. Given the problem constraints, `n` should be an integer between 2 and 50.

Since the loop will start with `i` being 0, and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, the adjusted state should reflect these conditions.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
