### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Condition Check**: The function checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends by iterating through the list `l` and checking if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. This condition ensures that friend `i + 1`'s best friend is `l[i]`, and friend `l[i]`'s best friend is `i + 1`.

3. **Output**: If such a pair is found, the function prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such pair is found, the function prints `3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 2`, the function will always find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, so it will print `2`.
   - For `n > 2`, the function will print `2` if a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is found, and `3` otherwise.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where at least one pair of friends are each other's best friends, and it prints `2` in such cases.
   - The function correctly handles the case where no such pair exists, and it prints `3` in such cases.

However, there is a potential issue with the function's logic:
- The function assumes that if no pair of friends who are each other's best friends is found, the minimum number of invitations required is always `3`. This is not necessarily true. For example, consider a case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. Here, no pair of friends are each other's best friends, but sending invitations to friends `1` and `3` will result in friends `1` and `3` attending the party, which means the minimum number of invitations required is `2`.

### Correctness: **False**

The function is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the minimum number of invitations required is `2` even if no pair of friends are each other's best friends. The function should be modified to correctly determine the minimum number of invitations required in all scenarios.
