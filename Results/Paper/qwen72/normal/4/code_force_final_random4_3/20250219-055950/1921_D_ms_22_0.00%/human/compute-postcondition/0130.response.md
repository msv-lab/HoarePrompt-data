Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the negative of `item[0]`, and `n` must be greater than 0. `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap, and `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, but `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**
