Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b.sort()
    max_heap = []
    tp1 = 0
    tp2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    for i in a:
        diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
        diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))
    while max_heap:
        item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
            diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
            diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
            if diff1 > diff2:
                tp1 += 1
                ans += diff1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
                ans += diff2
        else:
            ans += -item[0]
            if item[2] == tp1:
                tp1 += 1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has finished executing, `max_heap` is an empty list, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `tp1` is equal to `tp2 + 1` or `tp2` is equal to `tp1 - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet used in the previous iterations.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, and `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `max_heap` is an empty list. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not already matched, considering the conditions in the loop. `tp1` is the index of the next unmatched element in `b` from the beginning, and `tp2` is the index of the next unmatched element in `b` from the end.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
