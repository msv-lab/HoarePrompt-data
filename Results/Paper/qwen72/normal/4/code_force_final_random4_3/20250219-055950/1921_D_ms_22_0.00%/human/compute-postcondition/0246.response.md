Postcondition: ***If the program is executed as the main module, `max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet used in the previous iterations for all test cases, and `tp1` is equal to `tp2 + 1` or `tp2` is equal to `tp1 - 1` for each test case. If the program is not executed as the main module, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2` retain their initial values or states.***
