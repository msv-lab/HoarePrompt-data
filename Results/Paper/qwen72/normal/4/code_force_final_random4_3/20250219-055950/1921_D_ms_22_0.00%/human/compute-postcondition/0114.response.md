The only object in the loop head is `max_heap`. For the loop to execute, `max_heap` must not be empty. Given that the state right before the loop indicates `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0**
