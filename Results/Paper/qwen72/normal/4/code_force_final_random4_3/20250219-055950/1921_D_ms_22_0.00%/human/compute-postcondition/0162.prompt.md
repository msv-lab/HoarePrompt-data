Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0. `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is updated by adding either `diff1` or `diff2` to its previous value. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. If `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, `tp2` is set to `m - 2` and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the negative of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1` (which is 0), then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. If `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 1. `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap. If `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is now `ans` plus the negative of the first element in `item`. If `item[2]` is 1, `tp1` is 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, and `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive), `ans` is increased by the negated value of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
