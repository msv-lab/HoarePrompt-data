Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `diff1`, `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap, and the index from `b` in `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. The absolute difference between the element from `a` in `item` and the first element in `b` (i.e., `b[0]`) is greater than the absolute difference between the element from `a` in `item` and the last element in `b` (i.e., `b[tp2]`).**
