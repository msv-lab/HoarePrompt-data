Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, and `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the `max_heap` list will be empty because the loop continues until `max_heap` is exhausted. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the first or last elements in `b` that were processed during the loop. The indices `tp1` and `tp2` will have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, but their final values will depend on the specific elements and their positions in `b` that were used to calculate the differences. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
