Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing two tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, the first tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)` and the second tuple is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, the first tuple is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and the second tuple is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `i` (the third element of `a`) and the first element of `b`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
