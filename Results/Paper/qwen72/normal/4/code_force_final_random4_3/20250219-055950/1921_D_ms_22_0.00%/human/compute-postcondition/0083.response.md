The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has finished executing, which implies that `t` is 0 or less. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `tp1` is equal to `tp2 + 1` or `tp2` is equal to `tp1 - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet used in the previous iterations.**
