Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` are unchanged. `tp1` is increased by 1, and `tp2` remains unchanged.** 

The value of `tp1` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values. The specific values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` are not altered, and `tp2` remains the same. The structure and content of `max_heap` and the form of `item` also remain unchanged.
