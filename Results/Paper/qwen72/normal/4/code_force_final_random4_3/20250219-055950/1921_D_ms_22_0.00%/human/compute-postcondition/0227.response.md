Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with one tuple removed and must still contain at least one tuple. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + -item[0]`, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.***
