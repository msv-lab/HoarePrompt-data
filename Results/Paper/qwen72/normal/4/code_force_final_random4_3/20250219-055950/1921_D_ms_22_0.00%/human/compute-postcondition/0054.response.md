Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple. After `heapq.heappop(max_heap)`, the list `max_heap` contains one less tuple.
- `item` is assigned the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` are not affected by the `heapq.heappop` operation, so they remain unchanged.
