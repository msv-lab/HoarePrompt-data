Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with two tuples removed and must still contain at least one tuple. `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated based on the condition. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff2` and `tp2` is decremented by 1. `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.***
