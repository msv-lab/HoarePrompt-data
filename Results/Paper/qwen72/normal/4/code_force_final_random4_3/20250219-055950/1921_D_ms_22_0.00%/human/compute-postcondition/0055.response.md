Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
