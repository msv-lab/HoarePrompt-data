The value of `ans` is incremented by `diff1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1-1]`, and `tp1` was previously increased by 1, the value of `diff1` is based on the updated `tp1`.

Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1-1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**
