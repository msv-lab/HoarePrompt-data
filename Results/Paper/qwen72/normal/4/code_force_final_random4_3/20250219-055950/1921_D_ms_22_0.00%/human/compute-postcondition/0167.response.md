Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The initial state indicates that `a` was previously a list of integers input by the user. After executing the code, `a` is now a new list of integers based on the user's input.
- The other variables (`max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.
