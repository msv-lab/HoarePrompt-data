Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that has not been used in previous iterations. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the `max_heap` is empty, `t` is 0, and the final state of the program reflects the completion of all test cases. If the function is not executed as the main module, the variables retain their initial states. **
