Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers input by the user, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple is either `(-diff1, a[j], 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, a[j], m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `j` is the index of the element in `a` and `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between `a[j]` and `b[0]` and `b[m - 1]` respectively, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations, the `max_heap` will contain `n` tuples, where each tuple represents the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the smallest or largest element in `b`. The first element of each tuple is the negative of the maximum absolute difference, the second element is the corresponding element from `a`, and the third element is the index of the element in `b` (either 0 or `m - 1`) that produced the maximum absolute difference. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial values.
