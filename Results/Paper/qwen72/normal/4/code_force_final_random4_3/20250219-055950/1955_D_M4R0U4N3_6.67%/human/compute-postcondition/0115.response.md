Postcondition: ***`r` is `m`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, the state of `done` and `todo` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.***
