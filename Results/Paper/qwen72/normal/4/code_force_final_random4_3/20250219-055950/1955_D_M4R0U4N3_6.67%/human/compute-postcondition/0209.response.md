Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` minus `old`, plus the integer `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `todo` no longer includes `a[r]`, `done` includes `a[r]`, and if `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

The code `done.add(a[r])` adds the integer at index `r` of the list `a` to the set `done`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `done` now includes the integer `a[r]`, while all other initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
