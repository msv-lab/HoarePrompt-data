Output State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `a` and `ans` remain unchanged, `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `old`, and `done`, `todo` remain unchanged. If `old` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. Otherwise, `done` and `todo` remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` no longer contains `a[m + 1]` and `done` now contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`.**
