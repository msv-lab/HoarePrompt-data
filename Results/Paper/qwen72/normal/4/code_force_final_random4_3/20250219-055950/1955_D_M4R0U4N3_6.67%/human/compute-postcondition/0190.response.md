Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` minus `old`, `done` is a set that may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop body, `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `old` is removed from the set `extra`.
- All other variables (`a`, `r`, `m`, `n`, `todo`, `done`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The set `extra` now contains the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`, minus the value of `old`.
