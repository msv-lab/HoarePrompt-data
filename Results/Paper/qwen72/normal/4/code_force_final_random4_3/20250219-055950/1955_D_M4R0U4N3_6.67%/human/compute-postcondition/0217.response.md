The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The integers `n`, `m`, and `k` satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the lists `a` and `b` contain integers within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. The function returns the result of whether there are at least `k` matching elements between the lists `a` and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. It returns whether there are at least `k` matching elements between the lists `a` and `b` for each test case.**
