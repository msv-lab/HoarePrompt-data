The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it checks how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in `b`. The function prints the count of such subarrays for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the internal sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are no longer relevant.
