Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 2`. `old` is `a[r - m]`. `extra` now contains `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[r - m]`, and `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged otherwise. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is `ans + 1`. If `old` is not in `extra` and is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` now contains `old` and `a[1]` (if `a[1]` was in `done`), `extra` no longer contains `a[1]` (if `a[1]` was in `extra`), `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]` (if `a[r]` was in `todo`), otherwise `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`, and `ans` is `ans + 1` if `len(done) >= k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is `m + 2`.
- The value of `m` remains `m`.
- The value of `n` remains `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 2`.
- The value of `old` is `a[r - m]`, which is `a[2]`.
- The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds `a[r]` to the set `extra`.
- The conditions and actions related to `old` and `a[1]` remain unchanged.
- The conditions and actions related to `a[r]` and `len(done) >= k` remain unchanged.
