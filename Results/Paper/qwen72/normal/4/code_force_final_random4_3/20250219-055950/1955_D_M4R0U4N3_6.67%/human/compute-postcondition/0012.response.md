Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0. If the first element of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` is updated to remove the first element of `a`, and `done` is a set containing the first element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not in `todo`, then `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a`, and `done` remains an empty set.***
