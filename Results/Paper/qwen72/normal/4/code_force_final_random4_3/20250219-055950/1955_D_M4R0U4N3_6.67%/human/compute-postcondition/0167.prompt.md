Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input, `done` is a set containing the integer `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus `a[1]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is a set containing the integers `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing only `a[0]`, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is a set containing only `a[1]`, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` is greater than 2, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus `a[1]` and `a[2]` if `a[2]` is in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is a set containing the integers `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` if `a[2]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing only `a[0]`, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` if `a[2]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is a set containing only `a[1]`, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
