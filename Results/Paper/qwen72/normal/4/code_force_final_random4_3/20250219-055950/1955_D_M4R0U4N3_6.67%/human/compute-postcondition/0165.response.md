Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` must be greater than 2, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus `a[1]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is a set containing the integers `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing only `a[0]`, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[2]` to the set `extra`.
- Since `j` is 2, `a[j]` refers to `a[2]`.
- The set `extra` initially contains `a[0]` and `a[1]`. After adding `a[2]`, `extra` now contains `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
