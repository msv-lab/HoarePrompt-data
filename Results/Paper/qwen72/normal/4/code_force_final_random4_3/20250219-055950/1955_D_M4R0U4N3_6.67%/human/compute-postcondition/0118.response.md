Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`, and the state of `done`, `todo`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

The value of `old` is `a[1]`, and `extra` is a list that initially contains `a[1]`. After executing `extra.remove(old)`, `a[1]` is removed from `extra`. The values of `r`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the conditions that `n` must be greater than `m + 1` still hold. The states of `done`, `todo`, and `ans` also remain unchanged.
