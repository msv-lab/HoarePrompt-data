Postcondition: ***`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 2`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m + 1]`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1, `todo` no longer contains `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `done` now contains `a[r]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, and `extra` remains unchanged if `old` is not in `done` or `extra`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo` and `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[m + 1]`, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged. If `old` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `old` and `todo` now contains `old`. If `len(done) < k`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are the same as in the precondition.***
