To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `m` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`.
   - `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`.
   - `done` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` and any integers from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were in `todo` and have been moved to `done`.
   - `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]` that were not in `todo`.
   - `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `m` is a smaller integer than `n`.
   - `old` is the element at index `n - m - 1` in the list `a`.
   - `todo` is a set that starts with some integers from a new input and is modified by removing elements that are in the first `m` elements of `a` and were already in `todo`.
   - `done` is a set that starts with elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were in `todo` and is updated with elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were in `todo`.
   - `extra` is a set containing elements from `a` that were not in `todo`.
   - `ans` is a counter that increments each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.
   - `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.

Since the exact values of `a`, `m`, `n`, `k`, and the new input are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the length of done was greater than or equal to k during the loop execution)**
