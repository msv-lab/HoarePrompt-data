The code snippet `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is less than `n`
- `r` is `m + 2`
- `n` must be greater than `m + 2`
- `old` is `a[m + 1]`
- `a` and `ans` remain unchanged
- If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[m + 1]`
- If `old` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `old` and `todo` now contains `old`
- If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1
- If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` no longer contains `a[m + 1]` and `done` now contains `a[r]`
- Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`
- If `old` is not in `done` or `extra`, `done` and `todo` remain unchanged

The code `todo.remove(a[r])` will remove the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. This means that `a[r]` is no longer in `todo`.

Output State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 2`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m + 1]`, `a` and `ans` remain unchanged, `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`, `done` and `extra` remain unchanged if `old` is not in `done` or `extra`, otherwise the previous conditions for `done` and `extra` still hold.**
