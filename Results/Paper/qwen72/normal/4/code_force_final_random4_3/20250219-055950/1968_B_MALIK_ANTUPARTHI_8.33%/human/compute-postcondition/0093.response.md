The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `b` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is 2.
- `b` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`b` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
