The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `b` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `b` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0, and `j` is 1.**
