Postcondition: **`b` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `k` is `e.index(d[0]) + 1`, and the element at index `j` in list `d` is present in the slice of list `e` starting from index `k-1` to the end. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
