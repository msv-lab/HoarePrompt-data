Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is `b - 1`, and `k` is the index of the last element in `d` that is found in `e[k:]` plus 1, or `b` if no such element is found or the loop is broken before the last iteration.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `b` and `c` are updated to the values provided by the user input, where the input is split and each part is converted to an integer.
