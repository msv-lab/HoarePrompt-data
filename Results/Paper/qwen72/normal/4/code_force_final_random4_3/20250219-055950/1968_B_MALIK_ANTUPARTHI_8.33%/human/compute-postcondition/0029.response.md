Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, and `k` is set to 2 if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
