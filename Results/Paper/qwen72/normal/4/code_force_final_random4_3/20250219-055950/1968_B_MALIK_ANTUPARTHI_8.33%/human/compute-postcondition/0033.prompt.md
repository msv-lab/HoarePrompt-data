Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `d[j]` is in the slice `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in the slice `e[k:]`, then `k` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, and `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and neither `k` is equal to `c` nor `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1. In all cases, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
