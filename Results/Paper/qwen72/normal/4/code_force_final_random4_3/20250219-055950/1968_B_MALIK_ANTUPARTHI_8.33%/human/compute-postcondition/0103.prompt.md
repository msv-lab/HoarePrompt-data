Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of the binary strings a and b, respectively. a is an integer input by the user, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is `b - 1`, and `k` is the index of the last element in `d` that is found in `e[k:]` plus 1, or `b` if no such element is found or the loop is broken before the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is a new input value, `j` is `b - 1`, and `k` is the index of the last occurrence of any `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or `b` if no such occurrence is found or if the loop breaks due to `k` equaling `c` or `j` equaling `b - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` remains the same, `j` is `b`, `k` is the last value of `j` where the conditions in the loop were met or `b` if the loop completes without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
