Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6**:
   - This means `s` is a string of lowercase letters, and its length can be anywhere from 1 to 1,000,000.

2. **`n` is the length of `s`**:
   - `n` is simply the number of characters in the string `s`.

3. **`func_1(s[0:])` is True**:
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True, which means the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.

4. **`i` is `n-1`**:
   - `i` is the index of the last character in the string `s`.

5. **There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`**:
   - This means that the string `s` is not entirely composed of the same character as the first character. There is at least one character in the substring `s[1:n]` that is different from `s[0]`.

6. **`x` is the index of the first such character**:
   - `x` is the smallest index in the range 1 to `n-1` where `s[x]` is not equal to `s[0]`.

7. **`func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False**:
   - `func_1` returns False when applied to the substring `s[x + 1:]`, which is the part of the string starting from the character after `x`.

Given these conditions, the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This print statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `x`, or the result of `func_1`.

### Explanation:
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of the print statement directly.
- The print statement is simply printing a constant string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
