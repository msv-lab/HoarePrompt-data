The `print(s)` statement will print the string `s`.

Based on the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- The length of `s` is between 1 and \(10^6\) (inclusive).

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific characters or the exact length of the string. However, we know that `s` is a valid string within the given constraints.

Output: **s (where s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6)**
