Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 1. If the second character of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is not equal to the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`), `x` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` remains -1.***
