Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is the index of the first such character. Additionally, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False.**
