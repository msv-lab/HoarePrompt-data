Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length `1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
   - `i` is `n-1`. This means `i` is the last index of the string `s`.
   - There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - `x` is the index of the first such character.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end.
   - `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `2`.
   - The value `2` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `2`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **2**
