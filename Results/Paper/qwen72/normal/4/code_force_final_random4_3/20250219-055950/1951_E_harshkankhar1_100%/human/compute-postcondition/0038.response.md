Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is the index of the first such character. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, then `func_1(s[x + 1:])` remains False. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, and if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value as 1 or `n // 2`. If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, then `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.***
