Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length \( 1 \leq |s| \leq 10^6 \).
2. `n` is the length of `s`.
3. `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
4. `i` is `n-1`.
5. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
6. `x` is the index of the first such character.
7. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False.

### Analysis:
- `func_1(s[0:])` being True suggests that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
- `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the string `s`.
- There is at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`. This means that the string `s` is not entirely composed of the same character.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` being False suggests that the function `func_1` returns False when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

### Explanation:
- `s[:x + 1]` is the substring of `s` from the beginning of the string up to and including the character at index `x`.
- `s[x + 1:]` is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 1` to the end of the string.
- The `print` statement will output these two substrings separated by a space.

### Output:
- The first part of the output, `s[:x + 1]`, will be the substring of `s` from the beginning up to and including the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`.
- The second part of the output, `s[x + 1:]`, will be the remaining substring of `s` starting from the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **[s[:x + 1]] [s[x + 1:]] (where [s[:x + 1]] is the substring of `s` from the beginning up to and including the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`, and [s[x + 1:]] is the remaining substring of `s` starting from the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`)**
