The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from the input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and its length is between 1 and 1,000,000. It checks if the string `s` satisfies a condition defined by `func_1`. If `func_1(s)` is `False`, the function prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the string `s`, and then returns `None`. If `func_1(s)` is `True`, the function searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s`. If no such character is found, the function prints 'NO' and returns nothing. If such a character is found at index `x`, the function checks if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`. If it is `False`, the function prints 'YES' followed by '2', and then the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the function further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of `s`). If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the function prints 'NO' and returns nothing. Otherwise, the function prints 'YES' followed by '2', and then the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
