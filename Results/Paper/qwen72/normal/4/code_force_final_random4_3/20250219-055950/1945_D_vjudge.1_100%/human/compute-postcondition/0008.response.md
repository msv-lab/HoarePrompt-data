Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `i` is `-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The variable `k` remains the same as it was initially.
- The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- The list `c` remains unchanged, with each element still being the minimum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- The list `suff` now contains cumulative sums of the elements in `c` starting from each index `i` to the end of the list. Specifically, `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` through `c[n-1]`.
- The loop index `i` is `-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
