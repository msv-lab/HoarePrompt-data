### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kirill wants to move from the end of the queue to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - To move from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`), he needs to pay `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins to each person at position `k` where `j < k < i`.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position for Kirill.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the costs for each person.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Step 1:** It creates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is crucial because it represents the minimum cost Kirill would pay if he were to move past the `i`-th person.
   - **Step 2:** It computes a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`. This array helps in quickly calculating the total cost of moving past a range of people.
   - **Step 3:** It initializes `ans` to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost.
   - **Step 4:** It iterates over the first `k` positions and for each position `i`, it calculates the cost of moving to position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This cost includes the cost of moving to position `i` and the cost of moving past all people from position `i+1` to `n`.
   - **Step 5:** It updates `ans` with the minimum cost found.
   - **Step 6:** It prints the minimum cost for the current test case.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case.
   - The use of the suffix sum array `suff` ensures that the cost of moving past a range of people is calculated efficiently.
   - The logic of finding the minimum cost by iterating over the first `k` positions and considering the cost of moving to each position is sound.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` (Kirill can stay in the last position without moving).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 1 (Kirill must move to the first position).

6. **Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the suffix sum array.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
