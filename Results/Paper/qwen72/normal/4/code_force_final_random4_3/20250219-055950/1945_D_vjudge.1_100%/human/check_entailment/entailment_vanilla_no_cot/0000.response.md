Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. Each test case reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This represents the cost Kirill would pay if he moves to position `i` and then moves through all positions `j` such that `j < i`.
   - It then calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from position `i` to the end. This helps in efficiently calculating the total cost when Kirill moves to a position `i`.

3. **Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity to ensure it captures the minimum cost.
   - It iterates over the first `k` positions and updates `ans` with the minimum cost of moving to position `i` and then paying the suffix sum for positions `i+1` to `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the minimum cost `ans`.

The logic and implementation seem to align with the problem requirements, and the program should produce the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
