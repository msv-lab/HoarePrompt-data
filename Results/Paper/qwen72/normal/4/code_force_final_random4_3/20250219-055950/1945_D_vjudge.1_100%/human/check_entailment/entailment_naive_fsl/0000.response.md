Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The program calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to the first `k` positions, but it does not correctly account for the costs of moving through intermediate positions.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `14`, which is correct for this specific case. However, consider a different input:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `33`, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the minimum cost. It only considers the cost of moving directly to the first `k` positions without accounting for the intermediate costs correctly. For example, in the second input case, the correct minimum cost to move Kirill to the 3rd position is `10 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 16`, but the program calculates it as `30 + 3 = 33`.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming, to account for all possible moves and their associated costs.
