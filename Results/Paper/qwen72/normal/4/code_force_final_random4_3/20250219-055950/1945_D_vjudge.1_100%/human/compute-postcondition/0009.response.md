Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, `i` is `-1`, `ans` is set to positive infinity.**
