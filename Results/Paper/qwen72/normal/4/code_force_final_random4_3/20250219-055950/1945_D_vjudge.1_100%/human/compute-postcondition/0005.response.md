Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `suff[n - 1]` which is now `c[n - 1]` and `suff[n - 2]` which is now `c[n - 2] + c[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `suff[i]` is updated to be the sum of `suff[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `suff[n - 2]` is now `c[n - 2] + c[n - 1]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
