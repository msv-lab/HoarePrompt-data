Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` with `suff[n - 1]` equal to `c[n - 1]`, `suff[n - 2]` equal to `c[n - 2] + c[n - 1]`, and `suff[n - 3]` now equal to `c[n - 3] + suff[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 3`.**
