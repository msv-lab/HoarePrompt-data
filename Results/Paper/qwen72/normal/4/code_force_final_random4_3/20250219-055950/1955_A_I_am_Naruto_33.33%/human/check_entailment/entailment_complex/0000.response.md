Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The program processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the cost in two different ways and prints the minimum of the two.

1. **Regular Price Calculation (`ans1`)**:
   - `ans1 = a * n` calculates the total cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price `a`.

2. **Promotional Price Calculation (`ans2`)**:
   - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` calculates the total cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price `b` and buys any remaining yogurts at the regular price `a`.
   - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost for the pairs of yogurts.
   - `a * n % 2` calculates the cost for any remaining yogurts (if `n` is odd, there will be one yogurt left over).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.
   - If `n` is 1 or less, it directly prints `a` because there are no pairs to consider.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - `min(10, 9) = 9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 9 + 5 = 14`
  - `min(15, 14) = 14` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 11 + 5 = 16`
  - `min(15, 16) = 15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22 + 0 = 22`
  - `min(20, 22) = 20` (Correct)

The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
