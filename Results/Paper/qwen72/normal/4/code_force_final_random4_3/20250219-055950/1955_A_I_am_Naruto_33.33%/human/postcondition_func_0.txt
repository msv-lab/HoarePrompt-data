The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a, b \le 30\). For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two values: `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these two values. If `n` is 1 or less, it simply prints the value of `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged outside the function.
