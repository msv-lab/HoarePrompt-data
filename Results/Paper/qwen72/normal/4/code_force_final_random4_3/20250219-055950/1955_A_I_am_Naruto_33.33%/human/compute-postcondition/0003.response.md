Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`.** 

The value of `ans1` is now the product of `a` and `n`, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
