### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **When `n > 1`**:
     - The function calculates two potential costs:
       - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
       - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.
     - The function then prints the minimum of these two costs.
   - **When `n <= 1`**:
     - The function directly prints the price of one yogurt (`a`), as there is no promotion to consider for a single yogurt.

3. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The calculation `ans1 = a * n` is straightforward and correct.
   - The calculation `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is also correct:
     - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost of buying the maximum number of pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - `a * n % 2` calculates the cost of buying the remaining yogurts (if `n` is odd, there will be one yogurt left to buy at the regular price).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case when `n = 1` by printing `a`.
   - The function also handles the case when `n` is even or odd by using the modulo operation to account for any remaining yogurts.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`
     - The minimum cost is `9`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 2 = 14`
     - The minimum cost is `14`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 2 = 15`
     - The minimum cost is `15`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 0 = 22`
     - The minimum cost is `20`, which is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering both the regular price and the promotion price, and it handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
