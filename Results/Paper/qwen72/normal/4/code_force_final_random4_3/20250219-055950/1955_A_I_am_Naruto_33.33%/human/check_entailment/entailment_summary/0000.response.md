Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two potential costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1 or less, the program correctly prints the value of `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `2 5 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - The minimum is `9`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `3 5 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
     - The minimum is `14`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `3 5 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
     - The minimum is `15`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `4 5 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
     - The minimum is `20`, which is correct.

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic is sound. It ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by considering both the regular price and the promotional price.

Correctness: **True**
