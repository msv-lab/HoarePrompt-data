Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`) with the cost of buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining at the regular price (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs. For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints the price of one yogurt (`a`), as there is no promotion to consider. This logic ensures that the program works correctly for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
