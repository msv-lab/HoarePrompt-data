Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0; `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, and the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is greater than `x`.**
