Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the integer 1 if `a[1]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains an empty list; `c` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 0; `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. If `c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as the precondition.***
