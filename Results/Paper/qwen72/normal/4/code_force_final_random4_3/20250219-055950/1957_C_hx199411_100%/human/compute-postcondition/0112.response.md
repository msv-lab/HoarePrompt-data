Let's break down the initial state step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(1)` statement is executed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1`. This is a bit confusing because it doesn't provide a clear initial value for `t`. However, for the purpose of this task, we can ignore `t` since it is not used in the print statement.
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `k` is an input integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `m` is `n - num`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is \((dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) \cdot dp[j - 2] \cdot 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - `num` is the total number of `c` and `r` values read, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r` and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `m` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `m` is 1.

2. **Analyzing the Variables:**
   - Since `m` is given as 1, we can determine the length of the `dp` list.
   - The length of `dp` is `m + 1`, which is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
   - The `dp` list is initialized as follows:
     - `dp[0]` is 0.
     - `dp[1]` is 1.
     - `dp[2]` is 3 (since `m` is 1, `dp` only has indices 0 and 1, but the precondition mentions `dp[2]` as 3, which is not relevant for `m = 1`).

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(1)`.
   - This statement simply prints the integer 1.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output is straightforward:

Output: **1**
