The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 4
- `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 4

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` must still be at least 4 to ensure that `i` is less than `m + 1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 5
- `m` must be at least 4

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `dp`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 5, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 13**
