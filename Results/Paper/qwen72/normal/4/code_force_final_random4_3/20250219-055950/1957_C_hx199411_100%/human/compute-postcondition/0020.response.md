Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n and `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are input integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 5. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is 6.**
