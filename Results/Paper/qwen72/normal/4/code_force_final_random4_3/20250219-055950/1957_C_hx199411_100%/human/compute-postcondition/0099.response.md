The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` was 1, and now it becomes 3. If `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` was 2, and now it becomes 4.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n and `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 3. Otherwise, `num` is 4.
