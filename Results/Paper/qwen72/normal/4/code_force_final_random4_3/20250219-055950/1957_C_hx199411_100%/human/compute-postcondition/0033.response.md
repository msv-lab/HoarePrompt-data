To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if the range from 3 to `m + 1` is non-empty, which means `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to start and iterate.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`
- `m` is `n - num`
- `m` is not equal to 0
- `m` is not equal to 1
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

We need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute. Since `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0 or 1, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 3. This means `n - num` must be at least 3.

The initial state of `i` is `k - 1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should be 3 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `m` must be at least 3
- `i` is 3

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 3, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
