The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, and a list of moves represented by pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. Here, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, which are valid positions on the `n \times n` chessboard.

The function returns the result of processing the moves on the chessboard for each test case. However, the specific output based on the moves is not provided in the constraints and relationships, so we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `k` moves represented by pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`, which are valid positions on an `n \times n` chessboard. The function processes these moves and returns a result for each test case.**
