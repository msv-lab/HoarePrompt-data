Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions of the loop, which is the sum of 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r` for all `k` iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `k` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- The variable `k` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- The variable `i` is now `k - 1`, reflecting the final value of the loop counter before the loop exits.
- The variable `m` remains `n`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `dp` remains unchanged, as the loop does not modify it.
- The variable `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions of the loop. For each pair of input integers `c` and `r`:
  - If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
  - If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2.
  - This process is repeated for all `k` iterations, and `num` accumulates the total increments.
