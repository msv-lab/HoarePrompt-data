The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n and `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are input integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 3. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is 4.**
