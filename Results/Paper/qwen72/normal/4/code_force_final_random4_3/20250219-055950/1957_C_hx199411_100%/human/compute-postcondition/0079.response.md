The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k`, and `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `m` must still be at least 3.

Given that `i` is `k` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` (which is now `k + 1`) must be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k + 1`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[k - 1]` which is `(dp[k - 2] + (k - 2) * dp[k - 3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[k]` which is `(dp[k - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[k - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**
