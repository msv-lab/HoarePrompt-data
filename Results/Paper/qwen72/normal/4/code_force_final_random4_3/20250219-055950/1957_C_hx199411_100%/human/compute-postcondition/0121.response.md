The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `m` is greater than or equal to 4. 

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 5. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`i` is 5, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007`, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 6 * dp[2]) % 1000000007`**
