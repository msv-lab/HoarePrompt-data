Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions of the loop, which is the sum of 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r` for all `k` iterations, and `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]` initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` where each element is 0.
- The initial state specified that `dp` had specific values at indices 1 and 2, and a formula for other indices. However, this initialization overwrites all elements of `dp` to be 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, and `num` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
