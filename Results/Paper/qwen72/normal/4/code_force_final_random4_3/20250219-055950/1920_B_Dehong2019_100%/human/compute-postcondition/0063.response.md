Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus `2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+k-1])`, and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` during the loop execution.**

The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated to the integers provided by the `input().split()` method. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The new values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are specific integers provided by the user.
