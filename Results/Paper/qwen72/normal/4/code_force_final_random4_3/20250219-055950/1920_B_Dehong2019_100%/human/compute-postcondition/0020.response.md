The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x-1`, and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `x`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans1` and `ans2` retain their values as described in the precondition.**
