Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans1` is `ans1 + a[x]`, `ans2` retains its value as described in the precondition.**

The value of `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[x]`, where `a[x]` is the element in the list `a` at the index `x`. All other variables retain their values as described in the initial state.
