Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the new input, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, and the sum of `i` and `x` is less than `n`.**
