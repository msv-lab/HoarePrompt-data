Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the new input, `i` is 1. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. If `i + x >= n`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.**
