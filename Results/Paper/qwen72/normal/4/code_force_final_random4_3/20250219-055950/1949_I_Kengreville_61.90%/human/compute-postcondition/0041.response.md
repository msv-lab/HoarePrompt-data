Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1, the element at index `1` is 1, and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` is an empty list, `j` is undefined as `nodes` is empty, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is 1.**

The value of `c0` is set to 0, which was already its initial value, so no change is observed. All other variables and their states remain the same as in the initial state.
