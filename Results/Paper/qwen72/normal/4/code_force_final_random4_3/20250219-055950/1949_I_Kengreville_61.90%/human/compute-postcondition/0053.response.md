The code snippet `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the value of `ok` based on the current value of `ok` and the value of `c1`. The value of `ok` is initially `True`, and the value of `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes`.

Since `ok` is already `True`, the expression `ok or c1 != 0` will always evaluate to `True`, regardless of the value of `c1`. Therefore, `ok` remains `True`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1, the element at index `1` is 1, and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` is a list with `m` elements (1 <= m <= n), `j` is the last element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is the sum of all elements in `coef0` at the indices present in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes`.**
