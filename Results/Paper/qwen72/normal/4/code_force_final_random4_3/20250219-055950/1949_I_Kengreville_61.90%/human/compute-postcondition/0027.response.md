The function `dfs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The function also relies on several lists: `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1`, each of length n. The elements of `x` and `y` represent the integer coordinates of the centers of the disks, and the elements of `r` represent the positive integer radii of the disks. The list `visited` contains boolean values indicating whether a disk has been visited in the DFS traversal, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers used to store coefficients for the DFS traversal.

The function does not explicitly return a value, but it modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists as part of its operation.

Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` representing the index of a disk and modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists during a depth-first search traversal of the disks.**
