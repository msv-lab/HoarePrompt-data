The code snippet `nodes = []` reassigns the variable `nodes` to an empty list. This overrides the initial state where `nodes` was a list with `m` elements (1 <= m <= n). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`. `nodes` is an empty list, `j` is the last element in `nodes` (which is now undefined), `ok` is `True`, `c0` is the sum of all elements in `coef0` at the indices present in `nodes` (which is now 0), and `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes` (which is now 0).**
