Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains at least one more element after the current `j`, `j` is the next element in `nodes`, `ok` might be `True` or `False` depending on the specific condition within the `dfs` function, `c0` is 1, `c1` is 1 + coef1[j].**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` increments the value of `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`.
- Since `coef0[j]` is 0 (as `coef0` is a list where the element at index `i` is 0 and all other elements are `None`, and `j` is the next element in `nodes` which is not `i`), `c0` is incremented by 0.
- Therefore, `c0` changes from 0 to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
