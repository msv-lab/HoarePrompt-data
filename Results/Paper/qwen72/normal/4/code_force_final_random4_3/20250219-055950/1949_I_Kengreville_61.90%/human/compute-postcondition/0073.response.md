Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, and the element at index 2 is 0 if `visited[2]` was `False` before the if statement, otherwise, the element at index 2 remains `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, and the element at index 2 is 1 if `visited[2]` was `False` before the if statement, otherwise, the element at index 2 remains `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least `m` elements where `m` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `j` is the last element in `nodes` (if `nodes` is not empty), `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is the sum of the first `m` elements of `coef1` (which is `m` because all the first `m` elements of `coef1` are 1).***
