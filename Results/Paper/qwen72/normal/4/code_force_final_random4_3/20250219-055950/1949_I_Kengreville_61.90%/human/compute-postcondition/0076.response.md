Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`.
- `coef0` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0.
- `coef1` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 1.
- `nodes` is a list with `n` elements, each element being an index from 0 to `n-1`.
- `ok` is `True`.
- `c0` is 0.
- `c1` is `n`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Since the `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`, and there are no variables or conditions that affect this output, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
