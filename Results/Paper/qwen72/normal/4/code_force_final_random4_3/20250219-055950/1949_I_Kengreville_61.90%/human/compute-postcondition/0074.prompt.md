Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain unchanged and are still initialized to `False` and `None` respectively for all their elements. The list `nodes` remains empty. `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain unchanged and are still initialized to `False` and `None` respectively for all their elements if `visited[0]` is `True`. If `visited[0]` is `False`, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains the index `0`, `j` is the last element in `nodes` (which is 0), `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain unchanged and are still initialized to `False` and `None` respectively for all their elements if `visited[0]` is `True`. If `visited[0]` is `False`, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1, the element at index `1` is 1, and all other elements remain `None`. `nodes` is a list with `m` elements (1 <= m <= n), `j` is the last element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is the sum of all elements in `coef0` at the indices present in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, and the element at index 2 is 0 if `visited[2]` was `False` before the if statement, otherwise, the element at index 2 remains `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, and the element at index 2 is 1 if `visited[2]` was `False` before the if statement, otherwise, the element at index 2 remains `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least `m` elements where `m` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `j` is the last element in `nodes` (if `nodes` is not empty), `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is the sum of the first `m` elements of `coef1` (which is `m` because all the first `m` elements of `coef1` are 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
