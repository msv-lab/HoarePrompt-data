The value of `c1` is incremented by the value at index `j` in the list `coef1`. The initial value of `c1` is 1, and since `j` is the second element in `nodes`, and `coef1` has the value 1 at index 2, `c1` will be incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least two elements, `j` is the second element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 2.**
