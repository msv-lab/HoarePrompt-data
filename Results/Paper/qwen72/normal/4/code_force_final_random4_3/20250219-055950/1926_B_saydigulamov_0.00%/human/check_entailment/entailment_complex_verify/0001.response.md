Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `a`, and then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and the `n` lines of input representing the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program collects the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' into a list `k`.
   - The program then checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal.
   - This condition is insufficient to determine the shape correctly. For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal. For a triangle, the elements should follow the pattern of a triangle (either increasing or decreasing by 2).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `k` instead of the required output ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").
   - This is a clear logical error, as the output format does not match the problem description.

4. **Logical Errors**:
   - The condition `if k[0] == k[1]` is not enough to determine the shape. It only checks the first two elements, which is insufficient for both squares and triangles.
   - For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal. For a triangle, the elements should form a sequence where each element is 2 more or 2 less than the previous one, starting from the smallest or largest element.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid contains an upside-down triangle correctly.
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid contains a rotated triangle, which is not allowed but should be considered invalid.

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
     - Check if all elements in `k` are equal to determine if it's a square.
     - Check if the elements in `k` form a sequence where each element is 2 more or 2 less than the previous one to determine if it's a triangle.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment accurately identifies the logical errors and the incorrect output format.

Final: **False**
