Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, this condition is retained.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `k` is a list containing the number of '1' characters in each input string `b` provided during the loop iterations. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings `b` that contained at least one '1' character. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, this condition is retained.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in each input string `b` where `b` contains at least one '1'. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings `b` that contained '1' characters. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the program retains this state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
