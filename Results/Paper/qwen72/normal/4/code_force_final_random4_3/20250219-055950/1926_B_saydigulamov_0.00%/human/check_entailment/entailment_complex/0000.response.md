Reasoning:

The provided function `func` is intended to determine whether a given grid contains a square or a triangle based on the distribution of '1's. However, the function as written does not correctly solve the problem for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Output**: The function prints the list `k` if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. This is not the correct output format as specified in the problem description. The function should print "SQUARE" if the grid contains a square and "TRIANGLE" if the grid contains a triangle.

2. **Incomplete Shape Detection**: The function only checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. This is insufficient to determine the shape. For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal. For a triangle, the elements should form a sequence where each element is 2 more than the previous one (or 2 less for an upside-down triangle).

3. **Missing Shape Validation**: The function does not validate the shape beyond the first two elements. It needs to check the entire list `k` to ensure it forms a valid square or triangle.

4. **Handling of Input**: The function reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself, but it does not store the grid in a way that allows for further shape validation. It only keeps the count of '1's in each row, which is not enough to determine the shape.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
