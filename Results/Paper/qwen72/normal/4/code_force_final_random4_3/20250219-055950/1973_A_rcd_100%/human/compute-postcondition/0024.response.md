Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 2, `y` is `p3 - 2`, and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` is now `p3 - 2`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
