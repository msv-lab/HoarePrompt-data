Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is `p3 - 1` (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `p3` must be greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(p1 - x + p3)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `x` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `p1` is an integer such that `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - `p3` is an integer such that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - The expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 - 1 + p3`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `p1 - 1 + p3` will be printed.
   - Since `p1` and `p3` are integers and `x` is 1, the expression `p1 - 1 + p3` will result in an integer.

Given the constraints, the exact numerical value of `p1` and `p3` is not specified, but we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - 1 + p3 (where p1 is an integer such that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, p3 is an integer such that p3 is less than p1 + p2 and p3 is greater than or equal to 2, and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
