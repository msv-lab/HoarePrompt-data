Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the loop breaks and the output is `p1 - x + p3`. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y < x`, and the output is `p3`. After all iterations, `x` will be `p3 - p2 + p1` and `y` will be `p2 - p1`.**
