Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`.**

The value of `y` is now equal to the value of `p3`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
