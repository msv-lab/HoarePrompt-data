Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `_` is 0 (though `_` is not used in the print statement).
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.
   - The current value of `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(p1 - x + p3)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1 - 0`, which is just `p1`.
   - The print statement `print(p1 - x + p3)` simplifies to `print(p1 + p3)`.

4. **Constraints and Implications:**
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` < `p1 + p2`.
   - `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` simplifies to `p1 ≤ p2 - p3` (since `x = 0` and `y = p3`).

Given these constraints, the value of `p1 + p3` will be a specific integer that satisfies all the conditions. However, without the exact values of `p1` and `p3`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, and p3 < p1 + p2)**
