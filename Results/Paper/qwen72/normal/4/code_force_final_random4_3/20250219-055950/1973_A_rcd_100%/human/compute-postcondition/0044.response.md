Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.
   - The difference between `p1` and `x` is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and `y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(p1 - x + p3)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1 - 0`, which is just `p1`.
   - The expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

4. **Constraints:**
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - The difference between `p1` and `x` (which is `p1`) is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and `y` (which is `p2 - p3`).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `x` is 0, the expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3`.
   - The value of `p1 + p3` will be printed.

Given the constraints, `p1` and `p3` are integers such that `p1` ≤ `p3` and both are between 1 and 30 (inclusive). The sum `p1 + p3` will be an integer value that is part of the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that p1 ≤ p3 and both are between 1 and 30, and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
