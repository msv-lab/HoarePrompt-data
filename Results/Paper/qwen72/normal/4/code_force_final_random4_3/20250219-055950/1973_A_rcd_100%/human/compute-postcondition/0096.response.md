Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and, for each test case, three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30. For each test case, it performs the following actions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the score of the third player (`p3`) is greater than or equal to the sum of the scores of the first two players (`p1 + p2`), it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it iterates through a loop to find a point where `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If no such point is found, it prints `p3`. The function does not return any values, but it prints the result for each test case. **
