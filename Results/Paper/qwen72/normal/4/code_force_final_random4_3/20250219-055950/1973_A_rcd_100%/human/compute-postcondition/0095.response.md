The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing the scores of three players after playing chess games, with the constraint 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.

The function returns different outputs based on the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each test case:
- Case_1: If `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are all equal, the function returns "All players have the same score."
- Case_2: If `p_1` and `p_2` are equal but `p_3` is different, the function returns "Two players have the same score, and one player has a different score."
- Case_3: If all scores are different, the function returns "All players have different scores."

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. For each test case, it returns "All players have the same score" if all scores are equal, "Two players have the same score, and one player has a different score" if two scores are equal and one is different, or "All players have different scores" if all scores are different.**
