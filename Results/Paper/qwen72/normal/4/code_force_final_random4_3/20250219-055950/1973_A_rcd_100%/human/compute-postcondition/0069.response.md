Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
- The condition `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30` is satisfied.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- Since `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers and their sum is odd, we know that:
  - The sum of three integers is odd if and only if one of them is odd and the other two are even, or all three are odd.
- However, the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, but we know they are integers and `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`, where `p1` and `p2` are integers such that `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30` and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30 and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
