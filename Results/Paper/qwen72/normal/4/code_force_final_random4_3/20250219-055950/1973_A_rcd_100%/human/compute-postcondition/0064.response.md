The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `_` will be 2 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2**
