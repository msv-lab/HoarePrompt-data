Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer greater than 2, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input. `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1` and `i` must be greater than 1. The current value of `i` is equal to `L[cur]`.**
