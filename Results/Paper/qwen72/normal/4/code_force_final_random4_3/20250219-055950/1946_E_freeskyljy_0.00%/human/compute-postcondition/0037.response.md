Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input. `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`. `cur` is 0 or -1, depending on whether `L[cur]` was encountered during the loop. `nums_left` is 0. `i` is 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- The variable `cases` remains a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2).
- The variable `N` remains an input integer.
- The variable `M1` remains an input integer.
- The variable `M2` remains an input integer.
- The list `L` remains a list of integers read from input, with the last element equal to the first element of `R`.
- The list `R` remains a list of integers read from input, with the first element equal to `N`.
- The variable `M1` remains greater than 1.
- The variable `ans` is now the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers, all taken modulo `MOD`.
- The variable `cur` is either 0 or -1, depending on whether the loop encountered the value `L[cur]` during its execution. If `L[cur]` was encountered, `cur` is 0; otherwise, `cur` is -1.
- The variable `nums_left` is 0, as it has been decremented to 0 over the course of the loop.
- The variable `i` is 1, as the loop continues to decrement `i` until it reaches 1, at which point the loop terminates.
