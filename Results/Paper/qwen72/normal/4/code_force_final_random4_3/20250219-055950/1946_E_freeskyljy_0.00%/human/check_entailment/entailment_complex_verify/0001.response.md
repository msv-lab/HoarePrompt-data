### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, and the lists `L` and `R` containing the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Basic Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. This is a necessary condition because the last prefix maximum must also be the first suffix maximum.
   - It checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This is correct because the first prefix maximum must be at index 1, and the first suffix maximum must be at index `N`.

3. **Overlap Check:**
   - The program checks if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If they are equal, it returns 0. This check is necessary to avoid invalid permutations where the second-to-last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum overlap, which would violate the permutation constraints.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of ways to arrange the elements using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is correct because it counts the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the positions before the last prefix maximum (which is also the first suffix maximum).

5. **Left Side Calculation:**
   - If `M1` is greater than 1, the program iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element. For each index that is not a prefix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the left side of the permutation. This logic is correct as it ensures that the elements are placed in valid positions according to the prefix maximums.

6. **Right Side Calculation:**
   - If `M2` is greater than 1, the program iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element. For each index that is not a suffix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the right side of the permutation. This logic is correct as it ensures that the elements are placed in valid positions according to the suffix maximums.

7. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program ensures that the final answer is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers. This is a standard practice in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow and is correctly applied.

### Annotations and State Validation:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
  - `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are correctly read and are within the specified bounds.
  - `L` and `R` are correctly read as lists of integers in increasing order.

- **After Initial Checks:**
  - The program correctly returns 0 if the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is not 1, or `R[0]` is not `N`.
  - The program correctly returns 0 if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`.

- **Combination Calculation:**
  - The initial combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is correct and sets the base value for `ans`.

- **Left Side Calculation:**
  - The loop correctly iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element, updating `ans` and `nums_left` appropriately.

- **Right Side Calculation:**
  - The loop correctly iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element, updating `ans` and `nums_left` appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints. It performs the necessary checks and calculations to determine the number of valid permutations. The annotations and state validation confirm that the program's logic is sound and follows the problem's constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
