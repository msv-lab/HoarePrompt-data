#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2), where n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), m_1 is the number of prefix maximums (1 ≤ m_1 ≤ n), and m_2 is the number of suffix maximums (1 ≤ m_2 ≤ n). Each test case is followed by two lists of integers: the first list contains m_1 distinct integers in increasing order (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing the indices of prefix maximums, and the second list contains m_2 distinct integers in increasing order (1 ≤ s_i ≤ n) representing the indices of suffix maximums. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single test case defined by the input values `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, along with two lists `L` and `R`. It returns 0 if any of the following conditions are met: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is not 1, `R[0]` is not `N`, or if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If these conditions are not met, the function calculates a value `ans` based on the binomial coefficient and the elements of `L` and `R`, and returns `ans` modulo `MOD`. The final state of the program is that `ans` is returned, which is either 0 or the calculated value based on the conditions and input.
