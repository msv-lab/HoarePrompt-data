To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i > 1`. The variable `i` is the only one in the loop head that can be adjusted to meet this condition.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is `N - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `N - 1` must be greater than 1, which implies that `N` must be greater than 2.

Since `N` is an input integer and it is part of the tuples in the `cases` list, we cannot directly adjust `N` itself. However, we can ensure that the condition `i > 1` is met by stating that `N` must be greater than 2.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer greater than 2, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input. `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1` and `i` must be greater than 1.**
