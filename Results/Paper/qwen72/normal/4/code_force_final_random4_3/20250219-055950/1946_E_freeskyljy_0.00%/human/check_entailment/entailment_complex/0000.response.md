Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Conditions**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, and the lists `L` and `R` which represent the indices of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Validation of Input Conditions**:
   - The program first checks if the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`. If this condition is true, it returns 0 because the permutation cannot be valid if the last prefix maximum is not the first suffix maximum.
   - It then checks if the first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not `N`. If either condition is true, it returns 0 because the first prefix maximum must be at index 1, and the first suffix maximum must be at index `N`.
   - Finally, it checks if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If this condition is true, it returns 0 because it would imply that the same element is both a prefix maximum and a suffix maximum, which is not possible unless it is the only maximum (i.e., `M1` or `M2` is 1).

3. **Calculation of the Number of Permutations**:
   - If the above conditions are not met, the program initializes `ans` to the binomial coefficient `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, which represents the number of ways to choose the positions for the elements that are not the last prefix maximum.
   - It then processes the prefix maximums (if `M1` > 1) by iterating from the second-to-last element of `L` down to the first element, updating `ans` by multiplying it with the number of remaining positions and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
   - Similarly, it processes the suffix maximums (if `M2` > 1) by iterating from the second element of `R` up to the last element, updating `ans` in the same way.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program returns the final value of `ans` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Correctness Analysis**:
- The program correctly handles the initial conditions and returns 0 when the permutation cannot be valid based on the given indices.
- The binomial coefficient calculation and the subsequent updates to `ans` are logically sound and follow the rules for counting permutations with given prefix and suffix maximums.
- The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the result fits within the required constraints and avoids overflow.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for updating `ans`:
- The program assumes that the number of remaining positions (`nums_left`) is always correctly decremented and used in the multiplication. However, it does not account for the fact that the number of remaining positions should be adjusted based on the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.

**Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the way it updates `ans` for the prefix and suffix maximums. Specifically, the `nums_left` variable is not correctly adjusted to reflect the number of positions available for the remaining elements. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases. 

For example, consider the case where `N = 6`, `M1 = 2`, and `M2 = 3`, with `L = [1, 3]` and `R = [3, 4, 6]`. The program should correctly account for the positions of the elements that are not prefix or suffix maximums, but the current logic may not do so accurately.

To fix this, the program should correctly track the number of available positions for each element that is not a prefix or suffix maximum, ensuring that the multiplication and modulo operations are performed correctly.
