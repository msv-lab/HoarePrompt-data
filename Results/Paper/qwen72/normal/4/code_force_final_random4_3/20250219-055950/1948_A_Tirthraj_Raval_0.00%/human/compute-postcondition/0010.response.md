The code snippet `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` appends a new element to the `pattern` list. The element appended is determined by the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. Given that `i` is 0, `i % 2` is 0, and `0 ^ 1` is 1. Therefore, the element `'B'` is appended to the `pattern` list, which initially contains the string `'A'`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than 0, `pattern` is a list containing the strings 'A' and 'B', `i` is 0**
