Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to create a string with exactly `n` special characters, as each special character must be part of a pair (one character equal to exactly one of its neighbors). Therefore, the function prints "NO" for odd `n`, which is correct.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the function prints "YES" and then constructs a pattern. The pattern is created by alternating 'A' and 'B' in pairs, which ensures that each character is special (equal to exactly one of its neighbors). The pattern is repeated `n // 2` times, resulting in a string of length `n` where each character is special. This is correct and meets the problem requirements.

4. **Output Length**: The generated string for even `n` is of length `n`, which is always less than or equal to 50 (since `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`). This is within the limit of 200 characters as specified in the problem.

5. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern construction using `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` and `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` ensures that the string alternates between 'A' and 'B' correctly, creating the required special characters.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 (odd) and when `n` is 2 (even).

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
