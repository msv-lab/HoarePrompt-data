To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and expressions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n // 2):
```

The variables and expressions in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `n // 2`

For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than 0. Let's break down the conditions:

1. **If `n` is odd:**
   - `n // 2` will be an integer, but since `n` is odd, `n // 2` will always be less than `n / 2` and will be a non-negative integer.
   - For `n // 2` to be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3 (since 1 // 2 = 0, and 3 // 2 = 1).

2. **If `n` is even:**
   - `n // 2` will be exactly `n / 2`, which is a non-negative integer.
   - For `n // 2` to be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2 (since 2 // 2 = 1).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1 (this does not affect the loop head).
- `_` is 0 (this does not affect the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer.
- If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer.
- If `n` is even, `pattern` is an empty list, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

We need to ensure that `n // 2` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 (for even) or 3 (for odd).

Since `i` is already defined in the loop head as the loop variable, we do not need to adjust it separately. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it meets the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 2 if even or at least 3 if odd, `pattern` is an empty list if `n` is even, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even.**
