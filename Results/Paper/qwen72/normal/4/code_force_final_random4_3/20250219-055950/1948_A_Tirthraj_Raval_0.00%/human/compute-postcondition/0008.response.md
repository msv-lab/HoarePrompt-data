The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`, and the expression `n // 2`. The loop will execute if `n // 2` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer, and for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

- `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `_` is 0 (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer and must be even and greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `pattern` is an empty list (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than 0, `pattern` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
