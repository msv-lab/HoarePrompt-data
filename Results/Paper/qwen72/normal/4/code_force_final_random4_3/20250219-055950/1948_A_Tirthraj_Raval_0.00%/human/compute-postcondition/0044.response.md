Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is ['A', 'B'], `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends the character at index `i % 2 ^ 1` of the string 'AB' to the list `pattern`. Since `i` is 0, `i % 2` is 0, and `0 ^ 1` is 1. Therefore, the character 'B' is appended to `pattern`. The other variables remain unchanged.
