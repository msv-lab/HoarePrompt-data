The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the result of `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n // 2` must be greater than 0.

Given that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to have started, and `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be at least 2 for `n // 2` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is ['A', 'B'], `i` is 1**
