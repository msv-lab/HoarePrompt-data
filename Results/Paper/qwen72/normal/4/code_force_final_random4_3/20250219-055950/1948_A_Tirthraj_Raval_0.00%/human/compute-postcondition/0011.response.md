The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an even integer greater than 0
- `pattern` is a list containing the strings 'A' and 'B'
- `i` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.
- `n` must still be an even integer greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again, `n // 2` must be greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than 2, `pattern` is a list containing the strings 'A' and 'B', `i` is 1**
