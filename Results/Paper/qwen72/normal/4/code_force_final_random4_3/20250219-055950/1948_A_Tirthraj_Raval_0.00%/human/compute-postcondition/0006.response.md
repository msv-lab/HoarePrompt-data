The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state provides the following conditions:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even.

However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, or `n`.

Output: **YES**
