The code `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends a new element to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Let's break it down:

- `i` is `n // 2`.
- `n` is at least 2 if even or at least 3 if odd.
- `pattern` is `['B', 'A']` if `n` is even.

First, we need to determine the value of `i % 2`:
- If `n` is even, `i` is `n // 2`, which is an integer. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` is also an integer, and `i % 2` will be 0.
- If `n` is odd, `i` is `n // 2`, which is an integer. Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be an integer, and `i % 2` will be 1.

Next, we determine what is appended to `pattern`:
- If `i % 2` is 0, `'AB'[0]` is `'A'`.
- If `i % 2` is 1, `'AB'[1]` is `'B'`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- If `n` is even, `pattern` will be `['B', 'A', 'A']`.
- If `n` is odd, `pattern` will be `['B', 'A', 'B']`.

The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 2 if even or at least 3 if odd, `pattern` is `['B', 'A', 'A']` if `n` is even, `pattern` is `['B', 'A', 'B']` if `n` is odd, `i` is `n // 2`.**
