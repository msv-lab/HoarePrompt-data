The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `b` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial values. `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is 1 if either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is the index of `d[0]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the previous value of `k`. If the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is met, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
