Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial values. `j` is 1. `k` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = j + 1` assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Given that `j` is 1, `k` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e`) are not affected by this code snippet, so they retain their initial values.
