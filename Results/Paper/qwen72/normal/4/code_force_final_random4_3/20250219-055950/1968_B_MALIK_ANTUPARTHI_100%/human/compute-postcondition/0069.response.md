To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t`: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `m`: An integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a`: An input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `b`: An integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `c`: An integer.
   - `i`: An integer set to 1.
   - `d`: An input value (likely a list or string, but not specified).
   - `e`: A new input value (likely a list or string, but not specified).
   - `j`: The index at which the loop broke, or `b` if the loop completed.
   - `k`: The last index in `e` where `d[j]` was found, or the value of `j` if the loop did not find `d[j]` in `e[k:]`.

2. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The variable `k` is determined based on the value of `j` and the content of `d` and `e`.
   - If the loop broke at some index `j`, `k` is the last index in `e` where `d[j]` was found.
   - If the loop completed without breaking, `j` is set to `b`, and `k` is set to `j`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `d` and `e` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `k`.
   - However, based on the given conditions, `k` will either be the last index in `e` where `d[j]` was found, or it will be the value of `j` if `d[j]` was not found in `e[k:]`.

Given this information, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be:

Output: **k (where k is the last index in `e` where `d[j]` was found, or the value of `j` if the loop did not find `d[j]` in `e[k:]`)**
