Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, and the value `d[j]` is present in the slice `e[k:].` If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`, `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
