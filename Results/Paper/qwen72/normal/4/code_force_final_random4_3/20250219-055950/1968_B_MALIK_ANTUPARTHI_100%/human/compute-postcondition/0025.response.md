Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 0. If `d[j]` is in the slice `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1` after this update, `k` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` and `j` remain as they were after the update. If `d[j]` is not in the slice `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
