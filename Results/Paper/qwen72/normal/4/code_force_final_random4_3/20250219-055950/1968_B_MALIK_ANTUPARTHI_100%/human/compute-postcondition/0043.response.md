Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of the element `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to the index of the element `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. Since `j` is 0, `d[j]` is the first element of `d`. The slice `e[k:]` starts from the element at index `k` in `e` to the end of `e`. The `index` method finds the first occurrence of `d[j]` in this slice and returns its index relative to the slice. Adding 1 to this index and then adding the original value of `k` gives the new value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
