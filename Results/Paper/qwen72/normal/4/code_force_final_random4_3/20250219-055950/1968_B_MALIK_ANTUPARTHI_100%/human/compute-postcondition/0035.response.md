To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is an integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `d` is an input value.
   - `e` is an input value.
   - `j` is the index at which the loop broke or `b` if the loop completed.
   - `k` is the value of `k` at the point the loop broke or the value of `j + 1` if the loop completed.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a`, `b`, `d`, and `e` are input values, and their exact values are not specified in the initial state.
   - `j` and `k` are determined by the loop's behavior, which is not explicitly provided in the code snippet.

3. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop's behavior is not explicitly given, but we know that `j` is the index at which the loop broke or `b` if the loop completed.
   - `k` is the value of `k` at the point the loop broke or `j + 1` if the loop completed.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If the loop breaks at some index `j`, then `k` will be the value of `k` at that point.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, then `k` will be `j + 1`, where `j` is `b`.

Since the exact loop conditions and the values of `a`, `b`, `d`, and `e` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given information:

- If the loop breaks at some index `j`, `k` will be the value of `k` at that point.
- If the loop completes, `k` will be `j + 1`, where `j` is `b`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **k (where k is the value of k at the point the loop broke or j + 1 if the loop completed, and j is the index at which the loop broke or b if the loop completed)**
