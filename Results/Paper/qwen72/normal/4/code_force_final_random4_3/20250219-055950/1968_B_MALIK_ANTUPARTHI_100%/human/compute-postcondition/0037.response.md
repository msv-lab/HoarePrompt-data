Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is the index at which the loop broke or `b` if the loop completed, and `k` is the value of `k` at the point the loop broke or the value of `j + 1` if the loop completed.**

Explanation:
- The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `b` and the second integer to `c`.
- The initial state specifies that `b` must be greater than 0, and `c` is an integer.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
