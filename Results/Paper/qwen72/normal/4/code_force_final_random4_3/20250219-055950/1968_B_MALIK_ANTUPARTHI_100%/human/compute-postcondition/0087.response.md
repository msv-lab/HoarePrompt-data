Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial values. `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the previous value of `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
