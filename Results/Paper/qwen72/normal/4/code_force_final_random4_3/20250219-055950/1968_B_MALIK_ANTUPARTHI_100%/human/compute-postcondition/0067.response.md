Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` == `c` or `j` == `b` - 1, `k` is set to 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
