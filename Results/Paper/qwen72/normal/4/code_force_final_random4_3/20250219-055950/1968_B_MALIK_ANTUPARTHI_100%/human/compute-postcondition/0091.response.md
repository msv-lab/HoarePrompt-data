Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial values. `j` is 1. `k` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = j` assigns the value of `j` to `k`. Since `j` is 1, `k` becomes 1. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
