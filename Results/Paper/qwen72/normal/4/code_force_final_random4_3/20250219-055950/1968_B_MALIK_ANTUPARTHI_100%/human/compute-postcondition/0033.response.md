Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` are integers. If `d[j]` is in the slice `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1` after this update, `k` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains as `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` and `j` remains as 1. If `d[j]` is not in the slice `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
