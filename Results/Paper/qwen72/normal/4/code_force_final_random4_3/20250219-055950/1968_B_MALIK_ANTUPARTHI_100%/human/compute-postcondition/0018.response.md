The code snippet `k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` updates the value of `k` based on the index of `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4
   - `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
   - `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5
   - `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
   - `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0
   - `c` is an integer
   - `i` is 0
   - `d` is an input value
   - `e` is an input value
   - `k` is 0
   - `j` is 1

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` is executed.
   - `e[k:]` is the slice of the list `e` starting from index `k` to the end of the list.
   - `d[j]` is the value at index `j` in the list `d`.
   - `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]`.
   - `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, and `j` remain unchanged.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Since `k` is initially 0, the slice `e[k:]` is the entire list `e`.
   - `d[j]` is `d[1]` (since `j` is 1).
   - Let `index` be the index of `d[1]` in the list `e`.
   - The new value of `k` is `index + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1, and `k` is `e.index(d[1]) + 1`.**
