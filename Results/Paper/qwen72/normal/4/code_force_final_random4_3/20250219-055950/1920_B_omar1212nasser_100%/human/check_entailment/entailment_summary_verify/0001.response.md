### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which are the most negative when multiplied by -1) and Bob to multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of the array `s` is calculated using `sum(elements)`.

4. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Bob's strategy is to multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1. The program calculates the sum of the smallest `x` elements and subtracts twice this sum from the initial sum `s` to account for the effect of multiplying by -1.

5. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements. The program iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `k`).
   - For each possible number of removals, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the smallest elements (which are the ones Alice would remove).
   - It also updates the sum of the smallest `x` elements `s2` to account for the changes in the array after Alice's removals.
   - The program then calculates the new sum after Bob's multiplication and appends it to the list `pos`.

6. **Optimal Sum Calculation:**
   - The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the best possible sum after both players have played optimally.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array is essential for both players to play optimally. Alice will remove the smallest elements, and Bob will multiply the smallest elements by -1.

- **Initial Sum Calculation:**
  - The initial sum `s` is correctly calculated.

- **Bob's Strategy:**
  - The program correctly calculates the effect of Bob multiplying the smallest `x` elements by -1.

- **Alice's Strategy:**
  - The program correctly iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove and updates the sum accordingly.
  - It also correctly updates the sum of the smallest `x` elements after each removal to ensure Bob's strategy is applied correctly.

- **Optimal Sum Calculation:**
  - The program returns the maximum possible sum, which is the correct approach to find the optimal sum after both players have played.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function `func_2` is responsible for calculating the optimal sum after Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications.
  - It initializes `pos` as a list to store the possible sums.
  - It calculates the initial sum `s` and the sum of the smallest `x` elements `s2`.
  - It appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the smallest `x` elements to `pos`.
  - It then iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `k`).
  - For each removal, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the smallest element and updates `s2` to account for the changes in the array.
  - It appends the new sum after Bob's multiplication to `pos`.
  - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

The program correctly handles the problem as described. It ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by sorting the array and calculating the sums accordingly. The logic and steps are sound and match the problem requirements.
