Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, the second element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, and the third element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, minus the second last element in `elements`, and minus `elements[-3]`, `i` is 3, `s2` is `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 3)]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]` updates the value of `s2` by adding the value of `elements[-(negatives + 3)]` to it.
- The value of `i` is 3, so `-(negatives + i)` becomes `-(negatives + 3)`.
- Therefore, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 3)]`.
- All other variables (`elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `pos`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
