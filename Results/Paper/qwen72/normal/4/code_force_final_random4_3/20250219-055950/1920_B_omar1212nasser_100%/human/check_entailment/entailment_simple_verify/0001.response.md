### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which are the most negative when multiplied by -1) and Bob to multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of the array `s` is calculated using `sum(elements)`.

4. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Bob's strategy is to multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1. The program calculates the sum of the smallest `x` elements and subtracts twice this sum from the initial sum `s` to account for the effect of multiplying by -1. This is correct because multiplying a negative number by -1 makes it positive, and multiplying a positive number by -1 makes it negative. The effect on the sum is thus `-2 * sum_of_smallest_x_elements`.

5. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements. The program iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `k`).
   - For each possible number of removals, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the smallest elements (which are the ones Alice would remove).
   - It also updates the sum of the smallest `x` elements `s2` to account for the changes in the array after Alice's removals.
   - The program then calculates the new sum after Bob's multiplication and appends it to the list `pos`.

6. **Optimal Sum Calculation:**
   - The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the best possible sum after both players have played optimally. This is the correct approach to find the optimal sum after both players have played.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Sorting the Array:**
  - The array is sorted in ascending order, which is correct for the problem. This ensures that Alice can remove the smallest elements and Bob can multiply the smallest elements by -1.

- **Initial Sum Calculation:**
  - The initial sum `s` is correctly calculated as the sum of all elements in the array.

- **Bob's Strategy:**
  - The sum of the smallest `x` elements is correctly calculated using `sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
  - The effect of Bob's multiplication is correctly applied by subtracting `2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` from the initial sum `s`.

- **Alice's Strategy:**
  - The program iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `k`).
  - For each removal, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the smallest elements (which are the ones Alice would remove).
  - It also updates the sum of the smallest `x` elements `s2` to account for the changes in the array after Alice's removals.
  - The condition `if negatives + i <= len(elements):` ensures that the program correctly handles the case where the number of elements to be multiplied by -1 exceeds the length of the array after removals.

- **Optimal Sum Calculation:**
  - The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which is the correct approach to find the optimal sum after both players have played.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described. It ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by sorting the array and calculating the sums accordingly. The logic and steps are sound and match the problem requirements.
