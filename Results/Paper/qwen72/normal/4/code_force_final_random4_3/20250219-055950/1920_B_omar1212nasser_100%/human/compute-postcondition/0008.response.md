The code snippet `s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]` adds the value of the element at the index `-(negatives + i)` in the list `elements` to the variable `s2`.

Given the initial state:
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`).
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`).
- `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`.
- `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`.
- `i` is 1.
- The current value of `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.

After executing the code:
- `s2` is updated to include the value of the element at the index `-(negatives + 1)` in `elements`.
- The value of `negatives + i` is still less than or equal to the length of `elements`.

Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.**
