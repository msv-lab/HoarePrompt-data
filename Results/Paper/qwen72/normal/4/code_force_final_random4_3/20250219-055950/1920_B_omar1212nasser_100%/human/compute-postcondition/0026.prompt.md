You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: elements is a list of integers, removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals <= len(elements) and 0 <= negatives <= len(elements).
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: `elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is the result of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of the loop. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`. If `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements` plus the sum of the `removals` integers starting from `-(negatives + removals)`. Otherwise, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`. `s2` is determined based on the condition: if `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements` plus the sum of the `removals` integers starting from `-(negatives + removals)`. Otherwise, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`, where `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers and `elements` is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value from a list of `removals + 1` elements, each calculated as the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, minus twice a value `s2`. The value `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, adjusted based on the relationship between `negatives`, `removals`, and the length of `elements`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`. `s2` is determined based on the condition: if `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements` plus the sum of the `removals` integers starting from `-(negatives + removals)`. Otherwise, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
