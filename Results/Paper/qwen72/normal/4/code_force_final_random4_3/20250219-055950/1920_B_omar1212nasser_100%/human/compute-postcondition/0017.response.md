To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `removals`. The other variables (`elements`, `negatives`, `pos`, `s`, and `s2`) are not directly part of the loop head, so we will not adjust them directly. However, we need to consider how the loop condition and the state of `i` will affect these variables.

### Given:
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`).
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`).
- `pos` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `s - 2 * s2`, the second element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the third element is `s - 2 * s2`.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` and minus the second last element in `elements`.
- If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` minus `elements[-i]` plus `elements[-(negatives + 2)]`.
- Otherwise, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` minus `elements[-i]`.
- `i` is 2.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `removals + 1` (exclusive). This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
2. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 3 at the start of the next iteration.
3. **`removals`**: The value of `removals` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 3.
- `removals` remains the same.

### Final State:
State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `s - 2 * s2`, the second element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the third element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` and minus the second last element in `elements`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` minus `elements[-i]` plus `elements[-(negatives + 2)]`, and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` minus `elements[-i]`, and `i` is 3.**
