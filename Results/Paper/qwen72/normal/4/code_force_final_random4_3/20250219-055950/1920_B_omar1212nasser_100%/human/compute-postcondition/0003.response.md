Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.**
