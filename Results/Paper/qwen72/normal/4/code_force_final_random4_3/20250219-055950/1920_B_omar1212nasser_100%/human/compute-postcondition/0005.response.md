Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the last element in the `elements` list (`elements[-i]` where `i` is 1).
- All other variables (`elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `pos`, `s2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`.
