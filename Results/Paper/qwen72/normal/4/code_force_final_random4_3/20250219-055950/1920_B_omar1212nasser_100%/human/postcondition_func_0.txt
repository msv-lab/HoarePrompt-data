The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` (where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k, x <= n`), followed by a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 1000). It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.
