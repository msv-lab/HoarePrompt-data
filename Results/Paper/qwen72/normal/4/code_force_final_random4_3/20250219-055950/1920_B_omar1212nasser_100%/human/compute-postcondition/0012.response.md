Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the second element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` and minus the second last element in `elements`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]`, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the second last element of `elements` (since `i` is 2).
- The values of `elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `pos`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `s2` remains unchanged if the condition `negatives + i` <= len(`elements`) is not met. If the condition is met, `s2` is still the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]`.
