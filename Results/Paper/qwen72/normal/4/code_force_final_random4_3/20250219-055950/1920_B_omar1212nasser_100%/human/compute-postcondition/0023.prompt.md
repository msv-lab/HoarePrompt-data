Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `elements` is a list of integers, `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    s2 -= elements[-i]
    if negatives + i <= len(elements):
        s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
    pos.append(s - 2 * s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the second element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `s2` and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `s - 2 * s2`, the second element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the third element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` and minus the second last element in `elements`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` minus `elements[-i]` plus `elements[-(negatives + 2)]`, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` minus `elements[-i]`, and `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing four elements: the first three elements are `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, and the fourth element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, minus the second last element in `elements`, and minus `elements[-3]`, `i` is 3. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 3)]`. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
