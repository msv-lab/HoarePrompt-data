The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= removals <= len(elements)` and `0 <= negatives <= len(elements)`. `elements` is a list of integers.

The function returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`. `s2` is determined as follows:
- If `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements` plus the sum of the `removals` integers starting from `-(negatives + removals)`.
- Otherwise, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`.

Functionality: **The function accepts `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`, where `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers and `elements` is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value from a list of `removals + 1` elements, each calculated as the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, minus twice a value `s2`. The value `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, adjusted based on the relationship between `negatives`, `removals`, and the length of `elements`.**
