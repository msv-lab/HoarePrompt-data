### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` to facilitate the optimal removal and negation of elements.

2. **Optimal Removal and Negation:**
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for calculating the optimal sum after Alice's removals and Bob's negations.
   - The initial sum `s` of the list `a` is calculated.
   - The function then iterates over the possible number of removals (from 0 to `removals`), adjusting the sum `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `s2` accordingly.
   - The list `pos` is used to store the possible sums after each iteration of removals and negations.
   - The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - **Alice's Strategy:** Alice will remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. This is achieved by sorting the list and removing elements from the beginning.
   - **Bob's Strategy:** Bob will multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. This is achieved by considering the sum of the last `negatives` elements and adjusting it based on the number of removals.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the sum after each possible number of removals and negations, and then returns the maximum of these sums.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `t` is 1 and the list `a` contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where `k` or `x` is equal to `n`, meaning Alice or Bob can remove or negate all elements, respectively.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the functions. For instance:
     - In the first test case, Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of 0.
     - In the second test case, Alice does not remove any elements, and Bob negates the largest element (4), resulting in a sum of 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.
     - In the fifth test case, Alice removes the two largest elements (9, 9), and Bob negates the next three largest elements (5, 5, 3), resulting in a sum of -5 - 5 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = -5.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to handle the input, perform the necessary operations, and produce the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
