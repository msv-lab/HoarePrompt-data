Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is increased by 2, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing the values [1, 2], `a[2]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `pf[2]` is assigned the result of `pf[1]` XOR `a[2]`, `a[3]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[3]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
