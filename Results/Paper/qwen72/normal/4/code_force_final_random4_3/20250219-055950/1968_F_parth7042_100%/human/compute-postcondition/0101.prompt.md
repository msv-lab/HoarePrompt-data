Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than `_`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict of lists, and `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is increased by 2, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing the values [1, 2], `a[2]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `pf[2]` is assigned the result of `pf[1]` XOR `a[2]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `index` is increased by 3, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 3], `a[2]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `pf[2]` is assigned the result of `pf[1]` XOR `a[2]`, `a[3]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `pf[3]` is assigned the result of `pf[2]` XOR `a[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
