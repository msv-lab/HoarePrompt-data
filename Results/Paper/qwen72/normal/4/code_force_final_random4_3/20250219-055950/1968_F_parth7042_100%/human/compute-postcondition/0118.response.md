The code snippet `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, or `it2`. The only change is that `results` now contains an additional element at the end.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is a list that now contains an additional element 'NO' at the end. Additionally, either `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`.**
