Output State: **`q` iterations have completed, `index` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`q` iterations have completed:** The loop has run `q` times, as specified by the loop head `for _ in range(q)`.
- **`index` is increased by `2 * q`:** In each iteration, `index` is increased by 2. After `q` iterations, `index` will have increased by `2 * q`.
- **`results` is a list of length `q`:** The `results` list has been appended with a string ('YES' or 'NO') in each iteration, so after `q` iterations, it will have `q` elements.
- **Each element in `results` is either 'YES' or 'NO':** The value appended to `results` in each iteration depends on the conditions:
  - If `x` (which is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`) is 0, 'YES' is appended.
  - Otherwise, if `it1` (the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`) is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` (the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`) is greater than or equal to 0, and the element at index `it1` in `v1` is less than the element at index `it2` in `v2`, 'YES' is appended.
  - If any of the above conditions are not met, 'NO' is appended.

The state of other variables such as `a`, `pf`, and `mp` remains unchanged by the loop, as they are not modified within the loop body.
