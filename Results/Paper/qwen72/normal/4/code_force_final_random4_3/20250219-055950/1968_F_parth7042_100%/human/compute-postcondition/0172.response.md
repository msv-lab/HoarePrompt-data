Output State: **`index` is increased by 1, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` contains the list `[2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 5`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[2]` which is `int(data[index])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `a[3]` is `int(data[index])`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` updates the value of `pf[3]` to be the result of `pf[2]` XOR `a[3]`.
- `i` is 3, so `pf[3]` is set to `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
