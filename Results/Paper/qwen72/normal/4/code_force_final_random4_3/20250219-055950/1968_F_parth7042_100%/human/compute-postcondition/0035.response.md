Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES', `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is 0.**

The code appends the string 'YES' to the `results` list, which was initially empty. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
