Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `q`, a list `a` of integers, and a list of `q` queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, `n` and `q` satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, respectively, and for each query, `l` and `r` satisfy 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The elements of `a` are integers in the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. The sum of `n` and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5. `data` is a list of strings, each element being a string from the input split by whitespace.**
