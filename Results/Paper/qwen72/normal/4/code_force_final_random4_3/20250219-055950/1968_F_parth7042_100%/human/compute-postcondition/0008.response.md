Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**

The value of `index` has been incremented by 2, so it is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
