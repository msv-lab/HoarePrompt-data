Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]` and `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `pf[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` now contains the list `[1]`, `i` is 2.**

The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, changing from 4 to 5. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
