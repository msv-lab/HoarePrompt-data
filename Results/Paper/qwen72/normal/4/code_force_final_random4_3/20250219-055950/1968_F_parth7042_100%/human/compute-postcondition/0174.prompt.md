Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`. `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0, 1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 3`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `i` is 1, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0, 1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains the list `[2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 4`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[2]` which is `int(data[index])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is increased by 1, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` contains the list `[2]`, `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 5`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[2]` which is `int(data[index])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `a[3]` is `int(data[index])`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
