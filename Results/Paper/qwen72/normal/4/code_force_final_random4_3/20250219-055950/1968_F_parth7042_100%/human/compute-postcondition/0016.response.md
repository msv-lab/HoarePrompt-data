Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `pf[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, and `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pf[1]` is updated to `pf[0] ^ a[1]`.
- `pf[0]` is 0 (as it is a list of zeros).
- `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`.
- Therefore, `pf[1]` is `0 ^ a[1]`, which is simply the integer value of `data[3]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
