Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `pf` with zeros, and the length of `pf` is `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
