Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros.**
