Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and the element at index `it1` in `v1` is less than the element at index `it2` in `v2`, then `results` now contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now contains the string 'NO' at the end. Additionally, in the 'NO' case, either `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`.***
