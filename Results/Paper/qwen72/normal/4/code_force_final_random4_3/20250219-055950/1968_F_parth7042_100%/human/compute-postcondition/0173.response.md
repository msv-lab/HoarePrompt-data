Output State: **`index` is increased by 1, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` contains the list `[2]`, `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 5`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[2]` which is `int(data[index])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `a[3]` is `int(data[index])`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list in the defaultdict `mp` at the key `pf[i]` (which is `pf[3]`).
- Since `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, the list `mp[pf[3]]` will now contain `[3]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
