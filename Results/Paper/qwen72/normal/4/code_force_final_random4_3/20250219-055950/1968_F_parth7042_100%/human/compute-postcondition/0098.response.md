Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `index` is increased by 3, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing the values [1, 2], `a[2]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `pf[2]` is assigned the result of `pf[1]` XOR `a[2]`, `a[3]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially increased by 2, it is now increased by 3.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a[1]`, `pf[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]`, `a[2]`, and `pf[2]` remain unchanged.
- The value of `a[3]` is still assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, but since `index` has been incremented by 1, `a[3]` is now assigned the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
