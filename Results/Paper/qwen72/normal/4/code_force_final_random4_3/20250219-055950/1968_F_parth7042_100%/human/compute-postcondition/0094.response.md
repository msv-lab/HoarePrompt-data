Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is increased by 2, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing the value 1, `a[2]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `pf[2]` is assigned the result of `pf[1]` XOR `a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `pf[2]` is calculated as `pf[1]` XOR `a[2]`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 2, so `pf[2]` is updated.
- The values of `n`, `a[1]`, `index`, `pf[1]`, and `mp[pf[1]]` remain the same.
- The value of `a[2]` is still assigned the integer value of `data[index - 2]` as per the initial state.
