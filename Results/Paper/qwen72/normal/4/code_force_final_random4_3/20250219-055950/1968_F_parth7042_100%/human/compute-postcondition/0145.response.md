Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `x == 0`, the appended element is 'YES', and the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the appended element is 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` assigns the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)` to `it1`.
- The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, and `results` remain unchanged.
- The value of `it1` is updated to the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`.
- The value of `it2` is still assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.
- The list `results` still has an additional element appended to it based on the value of `x`.
- The program continues to the next iteration if `x == 0`, appending 'YES' to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended.
