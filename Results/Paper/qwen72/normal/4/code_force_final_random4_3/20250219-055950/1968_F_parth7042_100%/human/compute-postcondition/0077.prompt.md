Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `3 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element is less than `r`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then `results` contains the string 'YES' if `x` is not 0, otherwise `results` contains the strings 'YES' and 'YES'. Otherwise, if any of these conditions are not met, `results` contains the string 'NO' if `x` is not 0, otherwise `results` contains the strings 'YES' and 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `7 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element is less than `r` minus 1. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `9 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[7 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element is less than `r`, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions. If `x` is 0, `results` includes an additional 'YES'. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
