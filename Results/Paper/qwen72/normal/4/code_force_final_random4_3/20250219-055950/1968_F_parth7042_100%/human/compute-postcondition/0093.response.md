Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 2, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing the value 1, `a[2]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The new value of `index` is `index + 1`, so `index` is now increased by 2 from its initial state.
