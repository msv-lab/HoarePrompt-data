Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. If `x` is 0, `results` has a new element 'YES' appended to it, and the program continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`.
- The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, and `v1` remain unchanged.
- The condition for appending 'YES' to `results` (if `x` is 0) is still valid and will be checked in the next iteration.
