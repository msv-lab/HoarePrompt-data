Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each test case, the grid is a 2 \times n grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters. `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's conditions, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` that match the corresponding characters in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]`, or 1 if the loop was reset due to a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop was broken if any character in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` did not match the corresponding character in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]` and was not a '0' followed by a '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings, each containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters. `ans` is a string containing the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions until the loop terminates. `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from the second character of `a` and the first character of `b`, or 1 if a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` are encountered, or the loop breaks if any other mismatch is found.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all iterations. `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value based on the conditions inside the loop. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]` for all `j` in the range, `counter` will be `len(a) - 1`. If any condition breaks the loop (i.e., `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]` and `a[j + 1]` is not '0' and `b[j]` is not '1'), `counter` will be the value it reached before the loop was broken. If the loop encounters a '0' in `a[j + 1]` and a '1' in `b[j]`, `counter` will be reset to 1 and the loop will continue.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
