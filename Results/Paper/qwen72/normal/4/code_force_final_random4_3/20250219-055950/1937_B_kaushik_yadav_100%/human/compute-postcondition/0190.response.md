Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from the second character of `a` and the first character of `b`, or 1 if a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` are encountered, or the loop breaks if any other mismatch is found. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)`, `i` is 4, otherwise `i` is 3, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`. `work` is False if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]` or if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, otherwise `work` is True.**
