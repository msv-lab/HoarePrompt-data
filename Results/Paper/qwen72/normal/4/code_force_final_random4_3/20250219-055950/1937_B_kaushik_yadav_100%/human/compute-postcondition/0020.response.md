Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a non-empty string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, and `work` is True. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is updated to include the first character of `b`, `i` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 1, and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, with the condition that either `i + 1` is equal to or greater than the length of `a`, or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` still holding.***
