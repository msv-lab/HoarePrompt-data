### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It uses a variable `work` to decide whether the grasshopper should move right in the top row or switch to the bottom row.
   - The loop iterates through the indices of the strings `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
     - If the next character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`, it switches to the bottom row by setting `work` to `False`.
     - If the loop reaches the end of the string `a`, it appends the last character from `b` to `ans`.
     - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` to `ans` and moves to the next index.
   - This logic ensures that the grasshopper always takes the smallest possible value at each step, and switches to the bottom row only when necessary.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The program initializes a counter `counter` to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It iterates through the indices of the strings `a` and `b` to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string:
     - If the next character in `a` is the same as the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
     - If the characters differ in a way that does not allow the counter to increment, it breaks the loop.
   - This logic correctly identifies the points where the grasshopper can switch between the top and bottom rows and counts the valid paths accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans` and the number of paths `counter` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Lexicographically Smallest String**:
  - The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string by always choosing the smaller value between the current cell in the top row and the next cell in the bottom row.
  - The condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]` ensures that the switch to the bottom row happens only when it is lexicographically beneficial.
  - The loop correctly handles the end of the string by appending the last character from `b` when necessary.

- **Number of Paths**:
  - The counter logic is designed to count the number of valid paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
  - The condition `if a[j + 1] == b[j]` correctly identifies when the grasshopper can switch between rows without changing the lexicographical order.
  - The condition `elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` ensures that the counter is reset if the grasshopper cannot switch back to the top row without increasing the lexicographical order.
  - The loop breaks when the characters differ in a way that does not allow the counter to increment, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It finds the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.

### Correctness:
