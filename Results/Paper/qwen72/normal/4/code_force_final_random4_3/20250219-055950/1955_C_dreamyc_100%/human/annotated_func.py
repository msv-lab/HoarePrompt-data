#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
    #State: n and k are positive integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9. Additionally, k is less than the sum of the elements in nums.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n - 1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `nums`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `nums` (which is the same as `s_a` since `nums` has `n` elements), and `ans` is the number of times `s_a` was less than or equal to `a` plus the number of times `s_b` was less than or equal to `b` during the loop execution.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times `s_a` was less than or equal to `a` plus the number of times `s_b` was less than or equal to `b` during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the value of `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the count of elements from the start and end of `nums` that, when summed, are less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`, respectively. The final state of the program includes the return value, which is either `n` or a count based on the conditions described.
