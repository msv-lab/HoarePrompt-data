The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `s_a` is increased by `nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 2]`. If `s_a` <= `a` and `s_b` <= `b`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `s_a` <= `a` but `s_b` > `b`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
