Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `nums`. `a` is equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and `b` is equal to `k // 2`. `ans` is 0. `s_a` is 0. `s_b` is 0.**

The code initializes `s_b` to 0, which was previously undefined. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
