Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 0, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- `s_a` has already been increased by `nums[0]` in the initial state.
- `s_b` is now increased by `nums[n - 1]`, which is the last element in the `nums` list.
