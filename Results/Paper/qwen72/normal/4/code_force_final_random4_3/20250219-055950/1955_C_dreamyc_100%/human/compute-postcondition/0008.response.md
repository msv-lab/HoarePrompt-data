The code snippet `s_a += nums[i]` adds the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `s_a`. Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, and `i` is 0, the value of `nums[0]` is added to `s_a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `n` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 0, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0]`.**
