The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1]`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
