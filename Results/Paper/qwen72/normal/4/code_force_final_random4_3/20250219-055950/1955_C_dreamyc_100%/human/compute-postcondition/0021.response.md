Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1, `s_a` is increased by `nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 2]`, `ans` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `i`, `s_a`, and `s_b` remain unchanged. The conditions for `s_a` and `s_b` being increased by specific elements in the `nums` list are still valid.
