Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are integers input by the user for the last test case, and `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings for the last test case. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a` for the last test case, and `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a` for the last test case. The loop has processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has checked the conditions and printed 'NO' if either the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row, or if the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column. Otherwise, it has printed 'YES' for each test case.**
