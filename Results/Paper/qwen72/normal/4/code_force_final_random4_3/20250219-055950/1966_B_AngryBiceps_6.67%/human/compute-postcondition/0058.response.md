Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.** 

The code snippet initializes `last_row` to an empty string, which does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the initial state remains the same, with the addition of `last_row` being an empty string.
