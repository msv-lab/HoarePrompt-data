Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects are as follows:

- `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, with `n` being greater than 0.
- `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is 1, meaning the first string in `a` contains only one unique character.
- The first string of `a` is not equal to the last string of `a`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
