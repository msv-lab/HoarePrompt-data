Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.**
   - This means `n` is a positive integer.

2. **`i` is `n-1`.**
   - `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.

3. **`a` is a list with `n` elements, each element being a user input.**
   - `a` is a list of strings, where each string is provided by the user.

4. **`first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of each user input.**
   - `first_row` is a string that concatenates the first character of each string in the list `a`.

5. **`last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of each user input.**
   - `last_row` is a string that concatenates the last character of each string in the list `a`.

6. **The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1.**
   - This means that all characters in `first_row` are the same. For example, if `first_row` is "aaaa", then the set of characters is {'a'}, and its length is 1.

7. **`first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.**
   - This means that the string `first_row` is different from the string `last_row`.

8. **Either the first element of `a` contains more than one unique character or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**
   - This condition implies that either the first string in `a` has more than one unique character, or the first string is the same as the last string in `a`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the string 'NO'. The conditions provided do not affect the output of this `print` statement directly. The conditions are used to determine the state of the program, but the `print` statement itself is hardcoded to print 'NO'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **NO**
