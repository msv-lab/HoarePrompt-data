Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing two user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of the first user input concatenated with the first character of the second user input, `last_row` is the last character of the first user input concatenated with the last character of the second user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the second user input (which is the last element of the list `a`) to the variable `last_row`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `_`, `a`, and `first_row`) remain unchanged.
