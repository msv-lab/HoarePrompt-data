Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings.
   - `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`.
   - `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - Additionally, either the length of the set of characters in the first row is not 1, or the first row is equal to the last row.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The condition `len(set(first_row)) != 1` means that the first characters of the strings in `a` are not all the same.
   - The condition `first_row == last_row` means that the string formed by the first characters of the strings in `a` is the same as the string formed by the last characters of the strings in `a`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet contains a `print('YES')` statement.

Given the conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute if either of the following is true:
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1.
- `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

Since the precondition states that either of these conditions must be true, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute.

Output: **YES**
