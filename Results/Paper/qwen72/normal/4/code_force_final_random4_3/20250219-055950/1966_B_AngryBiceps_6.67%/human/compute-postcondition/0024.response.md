Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.**
   - This means `n` is a positive integer.

2. **`i` is `n-1`.**
   - `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.

3. **`_` is 0.**
   - This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it.

4. **`a` is a list containing `n` user inputs.**
   - `a` is a list of strings, where each string is an input provided by the user.

5. **`first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together.**
   - `first_row` is a string formed by taking the first character of each string in the list `a` and concatenating them.

6. **`last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together.**
   - `last_row` is a string formed by taking the last character of each string in the list `a` and concatenating them.

7. **Either the length of the set of the first element of `a` is not 1, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**
   - This condition checks if the first string in `a` has more than one unique character, or if the first string is the same as the last string in `a`.

8. **Additionally, either the length of the set of `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
   - This condition checks if the string `first_row` has more than one unique character, or if `first_row` is the same as `last_row`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute if either of the two conditions is met. Since the conditions are complex and involve user inputs, we need to determine if they are likely to be true based on the initial state.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** `len(set(a[0])) != 1 or a[0] == a[-1]`
  - This means that either the first string in `a` has more than one unique character, or the first string is the same as the last string in `a`.
  - If the first string has more than one unique character, the condition is true.
  - If the first string is the same as the last string, the condition is true.

- **Condition 2:** `len(set(first_row)) != 1 or first_row == last_row`
  - This means that either the string `first_row` has more than one unique character, or `first_row` is the same as `last_row`.
  - If `first_row` has more than one unique character, the condition is true.
  - If `first_row` is the same as `last_row`, the condition is true.

Since the conditions are disjunctive (using `or`), if either of them is true, the `print('YES')` statement will execute.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute because it is highly likely that at least one of the conditions will be true. The conditions are designed to check for non-uniformity or equality in the strings, which are common in user inputs.

Output: **YES**
