Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing two user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of the first user input, `last_row` is the last character of the first user input.**

The code `a.append(input())` adds a new user input to the list `a`, which initially contained one user input. Now, `a` contains two user inputs. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `_`, `first_row`, `last_row`) remain unchanged.
