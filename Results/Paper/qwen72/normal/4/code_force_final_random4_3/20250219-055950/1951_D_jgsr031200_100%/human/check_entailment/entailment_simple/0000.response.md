### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin. This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The first stall price is set to `n - k + 1`, which ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from this stall (since `n - k + 1` is the minimum price that leaves her with fewer than `k` coins).
   - The second stall price is set to 1, which allows Alice to buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) by iterating over the `costs` list and using integer division to determine how many jewels she can buy from each stall.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given setup.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints "YES" and the prices of the two stalls.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n == k` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `n < k` correctly.
   - For other cases, the logic of setting up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if `n >= k`.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" as required.
   - If the answer is "YES", it prints the number of stalls (2) and the prices of the stalls.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the specified cases correctly. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the stalls with appropriate prices.

### Correctness:
**True**
