Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the function correctly prints 'YES', followed by `1` and `1`. This is because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with a price of `1` coin per jewel, and she will have exactly `0` coins left.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the function correctly prints 'NO'. This is because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` and `h` accordingly.
   - The loop is designed to ensure that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall and then buys the remaining jewels from the second stall.
   - The function checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`. If it is, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by `2` and the values in `costs`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is exactly `k`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `k`.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than 60. The problem specifies that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, but the function always prints `2` stalls, which is incorrect if `k` is greater than 60.

4. **General Case**:
   - The function's logic for setting up two stalls is flawed. It assumes that `n - k + 1` and `1` will always result in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels, but this is not necessarily true for all values of `n` and `k`.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the function sets up stalls with prices `8` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 8 coins) and then 2 jewels from the second stall (spending 2 coins), totaling 3 jewels. This is correct.
   - However, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the function sets up stalls with prices `6` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 6 coins) and then 4 jewels from the second stall (spending 4 coins), totaling 5 jewels. This is also correct.
   - The issue arises when `k` is greater than 60. For example, if `n = 1000` and `k = 61`, the function will still print `2` stalls, which is incorrect because Bob can only set up at most 60 stalls.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would be to check if `k` is greater than 60. If it is, print 'NO'.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to 60, Bob can set up `k` stalls, each with a price of `1` coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, as she will spend `k` coins and have `n - k` coins left.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k` is greater than 60 and it uses a flawed logic for setting up the stalls.

Correctness: **False**
