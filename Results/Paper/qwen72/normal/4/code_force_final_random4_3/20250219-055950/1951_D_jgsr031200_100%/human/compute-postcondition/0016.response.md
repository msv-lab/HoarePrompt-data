The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`. The loop iterates over the elements of `costs`, so the state of `i` and `costs` need to be considered for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - k + 1`
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`
- `h` is `h + n // (n - k + 1)`
- `n` is `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be the next element in the `costs` list. Since `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, the next value of `i` will be `1`.

The state of `costs` remains the same as it is the list being iterated over.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `h` is `h + n // (n - k + 1)`, `n` is `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`**
