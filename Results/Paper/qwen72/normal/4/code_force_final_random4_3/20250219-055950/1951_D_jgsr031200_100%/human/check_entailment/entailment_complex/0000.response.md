### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy.

2. **Base Case: `n == k`**:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints "YES", followed by `1` and `1`. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `1` coin each, and she will have `0` coins left, which is exactly what is needed.

3. **Base Case: `n < k`**:
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

4. **General Case: `n >= k`**:
   - The program sets up a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs and calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall.
   - The variable `h` is used to keep track of the total number of jewels Alice buys.
   - The program updates `n` by subtracting the total cost of the jewels bought at each stall.
   - After the loop, it checks if `h` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", followed by `2` and the values in `costs`.

5. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic of setting `costs` to `[n - k + 1, 1]` is intended to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The first stall is priced such that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels, and the second stall is priced at `1` coin per jewel, ensuring she buys the remaining `1` jewel.
   - However, the calculation of `curr` and the update of `n` are not necessary and can be simplified. The program should directly check if the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from the two stalls is equal to `k`.

6. **Simplified Logic**:
   - If `n >= k`, Alice can always buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and another with a price of `1` coin per jewel.
   - This ensures that Alice buys `k-1` jewels from the first stall and `1` jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but the logic for calculating `curr` and updating `n` is unnecessary and can be simplified. The core idea of setting up two stalls with specific prices is correct and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the problem constraints. It prints the correct output for each scenario, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when possible.
