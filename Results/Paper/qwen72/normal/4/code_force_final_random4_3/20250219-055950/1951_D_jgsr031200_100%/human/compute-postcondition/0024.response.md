Output State: **`i` is 1, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `curr` is `n // 1`, `h` is `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`, `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) % 1`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop iterates over the elements of the `costs` list, which are `[n - k + 1, 1]`. After the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.
- **`costs`**: The list `costs` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`curr`**: During the second iteration, `curr` is calculated as `n // 1`, which is simply `n` (since any number divided by 1 is itself).
- **`h`**: The variable `h` accumulates the value of `curr` for each iteration. After the first iteration, `h` is incremented by `n // (n - k + 1)`. After the second iteration, `h` is further incremented by `n % (n - k + 1) // 1`, which is just `n % (n - k + 1)` because `n % (n - k + 1)` is less than `n - k + 1` and thus `n % (n - k + 1) // 1` is simply `n % (n - k + 1)`.
- **`n`**: After the first iteration, `n` is reduced by `(n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`. In the second iteration, `n` is further reduced by `1 * (n % (n - k + 1))`. After the second iteration, `n` is 0 because `n % 1` is always 0.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `h` will be the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by the elements in `costs`, and `n` will be 0.
