The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, stating that they are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and that `n` is equal to `k`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` in any way. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
