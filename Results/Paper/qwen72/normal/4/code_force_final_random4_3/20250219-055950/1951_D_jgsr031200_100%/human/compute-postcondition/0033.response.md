Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= n, k <= 10^18) and performs the following actions: If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by two '1's and returns. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' and returns. If `n` is greater than `k`, it calculates a series of values and prints 'NO' if the sum of these values is less than `k`. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by '2', and the values in the `costs` list. The function does not return any value. **
