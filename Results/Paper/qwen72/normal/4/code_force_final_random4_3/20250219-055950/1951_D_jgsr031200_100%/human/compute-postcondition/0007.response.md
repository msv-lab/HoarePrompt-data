Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers.
- Both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
