The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `costs`. The loop will execute for each element in `costs`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `costs` must be used. The list `costs` has two elements, so the next element after 1 is `n - k + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n - k + 1`
- `costs` remains `[n - k + 1, 1]`

The other variables (`curr`, `h`, and `n`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `curr` is `n // 1`, `h` is `h + n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1`, `n` is `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1)) - i * curr`**
