To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`. The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `cur` is equal to `low + 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `cur` is set to `low + 2` in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `low + 2` is less than or equal to `high`.

Given that `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, the condition `high >= low + 2` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `_`, `low`, or `high` for the loop to execute one more time. The only variable that needs to be considered is `cur`, which is already set to `low + 2`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low + 2`**
