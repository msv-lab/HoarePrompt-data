To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head, which is `high >= cur`. Let's break down the state and the conditions:

- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `_` is 0 (also not relevant to the loop condition).
- `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`.
- `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`.
- `cur` is `low`.
- The sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd (this affects the loop body, not the loop head).
- `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2` (this is a constraint on the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`).

For the loop `while high >= cur` to execute at least once, the condition `high >= cur` must be true. Given that `cur` is initialized to `low`, we need to ensure that `high >= low`.

Let's analyze the values of `low` and `high`:
- `low` is the minimum of `p_3 - p_1` and `p_3 - p_2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p_3 - p_1` and `p_3 - p_2`.

Since `low` and `high` are derived from the same two values (`p_3 - p_1` and `p_3 - p_2`), `high` will always be greater than or equal to `low`. Therefore, the condition `high >= cur` (which is `high >= low`) will always be true, and the loop will execute at least once.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the state variables in the loop head.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `cur` is `low`, and if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`.**
