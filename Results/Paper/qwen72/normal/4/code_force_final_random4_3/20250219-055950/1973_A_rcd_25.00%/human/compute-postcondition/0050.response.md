Postcondition: ***`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is equal to `low + 2`.***
