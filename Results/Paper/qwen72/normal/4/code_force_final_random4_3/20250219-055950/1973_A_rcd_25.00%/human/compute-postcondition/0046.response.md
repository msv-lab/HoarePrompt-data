The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `high >= cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is equal to `low`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`. Given that `cur` is updated to `low + 1` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not met, we need to ensure that `low + 1` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it is guaranteed that `low + 1` will be less than or equal to `high` as long as `high` is at least 1 more than `low`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `cur` is now `low + 1` and `high` is still the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low + 1`**
