Functionality: **The function accepts three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3, representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games, and an integer t representing the number of test cases. The function returns different outputs based on the scores: if p_1, p_2, and p_3 are all within the range 0 to 30 and p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3, it returns a result for each test case. If any score is outside this range or the order is not maintained, it returns an error message.**
