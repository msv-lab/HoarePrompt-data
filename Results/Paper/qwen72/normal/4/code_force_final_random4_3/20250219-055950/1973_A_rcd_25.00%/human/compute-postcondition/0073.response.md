The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`. The loop condition is `high >= cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `cur` remains equal to `low`.
- Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1`, and `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

Given that `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be at least `cur`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time:
- If `cur` is `low`, then `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`.
- If `cur` is `low + 1`, then `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.

Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is always greater than or equal to `low`. Therefore, `high` will always be greater than or equal to `cur` if `cur` is `low` or `low + 1`.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`**.
