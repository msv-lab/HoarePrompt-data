To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `low` is \( \min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2) \).
   - `high` is \( \max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2) \).
   - `p_3` is less than \( p_1 + p_2 \).
   - `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers within the range [0, 30].
   - `cur` is incremented by 1, so `cur` is 1.
   - The expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to `p1 - 1 + p3`.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
   - Since `cur` is 1, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` becomes `p1 - 1 + p3`.
   - This simplifies to `p1 + p3 - 1`.

Given the constraints:
- \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\)
- \(p_3 < p_1 + p_2\)
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, which means `high` must be at least 2.

However, the exact values of `p_1` and `p_3` are not provided, so we can't compute a specific numerical value. But we can describe the output in terms of `p_1` and `p_3`.

Output: **p1 + p3 - 1 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30 and p3 < p1 + p2)**
