Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low + 2`.** 

The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `low + 2`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `_`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.
