The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of several variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `_`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the initial state.

Output: **-1**
