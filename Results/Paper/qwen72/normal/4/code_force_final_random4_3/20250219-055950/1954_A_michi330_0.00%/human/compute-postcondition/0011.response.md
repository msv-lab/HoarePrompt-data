To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `func` is not properly defined (this is irrelevant to the `print` statement).
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (this is also irrelevant to the `print` statement).
   - `itest` is 1 (this is irrelevant to the `print` statement).
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
   - The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true if:
     - `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The `print('Yes')` statement is executed if the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true.
   - If the condition is true, the statement will print 'Yes'.
   - If the condition is false, the statement will not execute, but since the precondition states that the condition holds true, the statement will always print 'Yes'.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the precondition, the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is always true.
   - Therefore, the `print('Yes')` statement will always execute and print 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
