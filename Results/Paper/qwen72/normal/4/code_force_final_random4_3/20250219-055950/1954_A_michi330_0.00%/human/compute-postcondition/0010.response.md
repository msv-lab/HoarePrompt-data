Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `func` is not properly defined.
2. `t` must be greater than 1.
3. `itest` is 1.
4. `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
5. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true if:
   - `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides conditions that determine whether a certain logical condition holds true. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on these conditions. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` or the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.

Output: **NO**
