Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and logic. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is used to determine if Bob can always repaint the ribbon to have all parts the same color.
   - `n <= k` checks if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that can be painted with different colors (after distributing the colors as evenly as possible) is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this is true, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Output**:
   - If either of the conditions is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that Bob can always make all parts the same color.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

This logic aligns with the problem description and the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
