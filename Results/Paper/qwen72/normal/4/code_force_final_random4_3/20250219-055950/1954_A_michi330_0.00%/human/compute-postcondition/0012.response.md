Postcondition: ***`func` is not properly defined, `t` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
