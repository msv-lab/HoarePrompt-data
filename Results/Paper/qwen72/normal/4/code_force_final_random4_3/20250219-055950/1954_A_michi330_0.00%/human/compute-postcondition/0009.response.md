The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten by the new input values. The variable `t` must still be greater than 1, and `itest` remains 1. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` will be evaluated based on the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`func` is not properly defined, `t` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
