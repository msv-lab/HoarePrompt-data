Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n-1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n-1) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `high` is updated to `(n-1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `(n-1) // 2` and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.***
