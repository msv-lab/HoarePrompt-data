Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is `(n-1) // 2`, `high` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n-1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n-1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is `(n-1) // 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
