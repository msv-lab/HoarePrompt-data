To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `low + 1 < high`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n-1`.
- `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`.
- `st` is an empty set.

The condition `low + 1 < high` can be broken down as follows:
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n-1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `0 + 1 < n-1` must be true. Simplifying this:
- `1 < n-1`
- `2 < n`

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute the first time. The other variables (`i`, `pos`, `st`) do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is an empty set.**
