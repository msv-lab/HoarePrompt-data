Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n-1) // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Initially, `st` contains the value `(n-1) // 2`. After the code execution, `st` will contain both `(n-1) // 2` and `mid`. The values of `n`, `i`, `low`, `high`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
