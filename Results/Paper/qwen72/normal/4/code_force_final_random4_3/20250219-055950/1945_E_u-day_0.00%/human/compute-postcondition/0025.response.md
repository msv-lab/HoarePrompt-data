Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n-1) // 2`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `mid` is updated to the value of `(low + high) // 2`.
- `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`, so `mid` becomes `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n-1) // 2`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `low`, `high`, `pos`, and `st` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `arr[mid]` is greater than `k` or `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k` is still valid, but `mid` is now calculated based on the updated formula.
