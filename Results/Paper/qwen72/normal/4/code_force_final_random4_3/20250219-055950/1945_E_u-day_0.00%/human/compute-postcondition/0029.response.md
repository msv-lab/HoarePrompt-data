Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n-1) // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.***
