The `print(0)` statement will print the integer `0`.

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, and `i` is `n-1`.
- It also mentions that `low + 1 >= high`, which implies that the range defined by `low` and `high` is very small or non-existent.
- `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`.
- `st` is a set containing the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint.
- Additionally, `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

However, none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print(0)` statement. The statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
