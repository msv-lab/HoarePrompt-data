The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `arr[i] == k`, `pos` is set to 2. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.**
