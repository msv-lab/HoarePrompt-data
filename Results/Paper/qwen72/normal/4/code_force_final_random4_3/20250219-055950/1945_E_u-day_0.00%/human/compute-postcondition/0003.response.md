The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be set by the `range(n)`.

Given that `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` after `func_2()` has been called, the critical state to ensure the loop executes is that `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
