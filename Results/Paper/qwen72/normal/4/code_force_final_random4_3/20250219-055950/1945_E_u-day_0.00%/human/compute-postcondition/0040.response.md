Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `low + 1 >= high`.
   - `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`.
   - `st` is a set containing the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.
   - `mid` is the last calculated midpoint.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is very straightforward. It prints the integer `1`.
   - The values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state do not affect the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
