You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, where each element in arr is unique and within the range 1 to n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 >= high`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: [low + 1], [pos + 1] (where low + 1 is at least high or greater, and pos + 1 is 0 if k is not found in arr, or the index of k plus one if k is found in arr)
    #State: *`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `low + 1 >= high`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `low`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. It returns the `k`-th smallest element in `arr`. If `k` is 1, it returns the smallest element. If `k` is `n`, it returns the largest element.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
