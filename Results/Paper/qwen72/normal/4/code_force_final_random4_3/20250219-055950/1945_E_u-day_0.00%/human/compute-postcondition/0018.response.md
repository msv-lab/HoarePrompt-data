Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n-1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n-1) // 2`.**

The value `(n-1) // 2` has been added to the set `st`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
