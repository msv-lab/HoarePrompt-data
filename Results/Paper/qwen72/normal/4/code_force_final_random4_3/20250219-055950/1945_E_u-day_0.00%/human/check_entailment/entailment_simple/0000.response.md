Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to read and process the input. `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, while `func_2` converts the next line of input into a list of integers. This is a standard way to handle input in Python for this type of problem.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**: The program correctly finds the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` by iterating through the list and setting `pos` to the index where `k` is found. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search Loop**: The binary search loop is implemented correctly. It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n-1` respectively, and then iterates, updating `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`. The loop continues until `low + 1 >= high`, which is the correct termination condition for binary search.

4. **Output Based on Binary Search Result**:
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the program prints `0` because no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the program prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap. This is intended to move `k` to the position where `low` points after the binary search.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is not found in `arr` by setting `pos` to `-1`.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is found but not at the position `low` after the binary search.

6. **Number of Swaps**:
   - The program ensures that at most one swap is performed, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps.

7. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program assumes that if `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, then swapping `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` will always result in `k` being found at the correct position after the binary search. However, this assumption is incorrect because the binary search is not guaranteed to find the correct position in an unsorted permutation. The binary search might end up with `low` pointing to a different element, and swapping `low` with `pos` might not necessarily make `k` appear at the correct position.

Given the logical flaw in the assumption that a single swap will always correct the position of `k` after the binary search, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
