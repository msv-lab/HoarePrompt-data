Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n-1) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` and `high` must satisfy `low + 1 < high`.**

Explanation: The code `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The set `st` now contains the values `(n-1) // 2` and `mid`, with `mid` being added again. The values of `n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. The condition `low + 1 < high` is still valid.
