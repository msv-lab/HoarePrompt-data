Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `low + 1 >= high`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, and `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
