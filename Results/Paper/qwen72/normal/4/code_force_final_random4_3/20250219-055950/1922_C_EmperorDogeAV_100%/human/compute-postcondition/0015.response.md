The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `cities`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `cities` (which is `n`). If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1, ensuring that `i` is still less than `n - 1`.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` < `n - 1`, then if `i` > 0, `back` is equal to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.**
