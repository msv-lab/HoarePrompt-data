Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the closest city is not unique for every city. According to the problem description, for every city, the closest city must be determined uniquely. However, the function `func_1` does not ensure this uniqueness. For example, if the cities are located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`, the closest city to city 3 (at point 12) is both city 2 (at point 8) and city 4 (at point 15), both having a distance of 3. This violates the problem's constraint that the closest city must be unique for each city. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
