Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list where `prog_cities[i]` is equal to `abs(forward - cities[i])`, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` < `n - 1`, then if `i` > 0, `back` is equal to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged. Additionally, the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**

Explanation:
- The code `prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])` updates the `i`-th element of the `prog_cities` list to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.
- The values of `cities`, `i`, `n`, `back`, and `forward` remain unchanged, except for the specific update to `prog_cities[i]`.
- The precondition that `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 1, remains valid.
- The conditions for `back` and `forward` based on the value of `i` also remain valid.
- The additional condition that the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back` remains valid.
