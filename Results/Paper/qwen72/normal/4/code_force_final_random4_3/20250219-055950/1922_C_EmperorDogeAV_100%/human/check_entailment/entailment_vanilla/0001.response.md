### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then parses the city coordinates from a string to a list of integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` with extreme values to handle edge cases.
   - For each city `i`, it updates `back` to the previous city and `forward` to the next city.
   - It then determines the closest city by comparing the distances to `back` and `forward`.
   - If the forward city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the closest city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum array for the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum array for the backward direction, which is calculated by reversing the cities list and applying `func_1` again.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array to calculate the minimum cost.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array to calculate the minimum cost.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are the same by ensuring `a != b` in the input.
   - It also handles the edge cases for the first and last cities by setting `back` and `forward` appropriately.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the closest city for each city.
   - The prefix sum arrays are used to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query.
   - The program correctly handles the direction of travel (forward or backward) based on the relative positions of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output formats as specified, and the algorithm for determining the closest city and calculating the minimum cost is logically sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
