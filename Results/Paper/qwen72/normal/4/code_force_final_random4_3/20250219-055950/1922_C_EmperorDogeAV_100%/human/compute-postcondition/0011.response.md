Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is 1 and the rest are zeros, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` < `n - 1`, then if `i` > 0, `back` is equal to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged. Additionally, the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**
