### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then parses the city coordinates from a string to a list of integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` with extreme values to handle edge cases.
   - For each city `i`, it updates `back` to the previous city and `forward` to the next city.
   - It then determines the closest city by comparing the distances to `back` and `forward`.
   - If the forward city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the closest city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum array for the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum array for the backward direction, which is calculated by reversing the cities list and applying `func_1` again.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array to calculate the minimum cost.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array to calculate the minimum cost.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are the same by ensuring `a != b` in the input.
   - It also handles the edge cases for the first and last cities by setting `back` and `forward` appropriately.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the closest city for each city.
   - However, there is a logical error in the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to return a list where each element at index `i` is the distance to the closest city from city `i`. The current implementation sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the forward city is closer, which is incorrect. It should set `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the closest city, which is either `abs(forward - cities[i])` or `abs(cities[i] - back)`.
   - The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(cities, n):
         prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
         for i in range(n - 1):
             back = -99999999999999999999
             forward = 99999999999999999999
             if i > 0:
                 back = cities[i - 1]
             if i < n - 1:
                 forward = cities[i + 1]
             if abs(forward - cities[i]) <= abs(cities[i] - back):
                 prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
             else:
                 prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
         return prog_cities
     ```

7. **Impact of the Error:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` will incorrectly set the cost to 1 for many cities, leading to incorrect prefix sums.
   - This will result in incorrect minimum cost calculations for the queries.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement due to the error in the `func_1` function. The function should return the distance to the closest city, not just 1 when the forward city is closer.

### Correctness:
**False**
