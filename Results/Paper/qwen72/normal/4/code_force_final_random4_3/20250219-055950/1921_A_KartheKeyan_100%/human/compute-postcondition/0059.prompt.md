Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, the function still accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)
    print(round(res))
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `n` is decreased by 1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)` from each of the 4 iterations, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
