Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in every potential case. The issue lies in how the program calculates the side length of the square. It assumes that the distance between the second and first coordinates (after sorting) and the distance between the fourth and third coordinates (after sorting) will give the side length of the square. However, this is not always true. The correct approach should be to find the unique x and y coordinates and then calculate the area based on the differences between these unique coordinates.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 1
1 4
4 1
4 4
```
The program will sort the coordinates as follows:
```
[(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)]
```
Then it calculates `p1` and `p2` as:
```
p1 = (1 - 1) ** 2 + (4 - 1) ** 2 = 0 + 9 = 9
p2 = (4 - 4) ** 2 + (4 - 1) ** 2 = 0 + 9 = 9
```
The area is then calculated as:
```
res = math.sqrt(9) * math.sqrt(9) = 3 * 3 = 9
```
However, the correct area should be 9 (since the side length is 3). The program will produce the correct result in this case, but it is not robust and will fail in other cases where the coordinates are not in a specific order.

A more robust solution would be to find the unique x and y coordinates and then calculate the area based on the differences between these unique coordinates. For example:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set([x for (x, y) in coord]))
        y_coords = sorted(set([y for (x, y) in coord]))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = x_coords[1] - x_coords[0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        n -= 1
```
This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the area of the square in every potential case.
