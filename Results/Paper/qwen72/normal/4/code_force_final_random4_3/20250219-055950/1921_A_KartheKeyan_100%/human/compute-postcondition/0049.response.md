The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the `range` which is 4. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The `range` remains 4.

State: **`i` is 2, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`**
