Output State: **`i` is 2, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`**

The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The initial state specifies that `coord` already contains two tuples `(x, y)`. After appending, `coord` now contains three tuples `(x, y)`. The values of `i` and `range` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` are still the input integers.
