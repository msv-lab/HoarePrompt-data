Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 3.
2. `range` is 4.
3. `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers.
4. `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`.
5. `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`.
6. `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.
7. `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`coord` List:**
   - Since `coord` is a sorted list containing four identical tuples `(x, y)`, the list will look like this:
     ```python
     coord = [(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]
     ```

2. **Squared Distances:**
   - The squared distance between two identical points `(x, y)` and `(x, y)` is always 0.
   - Therefore, `p1` and `p2` will both be 0:
     ```python
     p1 = (x - x)**2 + (y - y)**2 = 0
     p2 = (x - x)**2 + (y - y)**2 = 0
     ```

3. **Product of Square Roots:**
   - The square root of 0 is 0.
   - Therefore, `res` will be:
     ```python
     res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2) = 0 * 0 = 0
     ```

4. **Rounding `res`:**
   - The `round` function will round 0 to the nearest integer, which is 0.

### Final Output:
The `print(round(res))` statement will print the rounded value of `res`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
