Output State: **`i` is 2, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)` has been appended to `coord`.** 

In natural language: The variables `i` and `range` remain unchanged with values 2 and 4, respectively. The variables `x` and `y` are updated to new integers provided by the user input. The list `coord` now contains the tuple `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)` that was appended to it.
