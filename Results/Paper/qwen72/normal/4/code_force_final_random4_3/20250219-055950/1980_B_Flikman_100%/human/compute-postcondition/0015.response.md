Output State: **`k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `removed_count` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `removed_count` is incremented by 1, while the values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition about the second element of `sorted_a` being equal to `favorite_value` and its impact on `removed_count` is no longer relevant because `removed_count` has been explicitly incremented.
