The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `i` is already set to `k - 1`, which is not necessary for the loop to start, but it will be adjusted to 0 by the loop itself. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be set to 0 by the loop.

State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
