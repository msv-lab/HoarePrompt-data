You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.

    #State: After the loop executes all `t` iterations, `n`, `f`, and `k` will have been reassigned `t` times, and `a` will have been reassigned `t` times as well. For each iteration, `favorite_value` will be the value of `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` will be the sorted version of `a` in descending order, `removed_count` will be the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` will be the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count` for any iteration, "YES" will be printed. If `removed_count` is 0 for any iteration, "NO" will be printed. Otherwise, "MAYBE" will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then determines if the `f`-th element in `a` (considering 1-based indexing) is among the top `k` largest elements in `a` when sorted in descending order. If all occurrences of this element are within the top `k` largest elements, it prints 'YES'. If none of the occurrences are within the top `k` largest elements, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has a value that is the same as other cubes, and these cubes are in the range of the first k cubes after sorting. The program incorrectly counts the number of times the favorite value is removed, which can lead to incorrect outputs.

Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

- The favorite cube is the second cube with a value of 3.
- After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`.
- In the first case, the favorite cube is removed.
- In the second case, the favorite cube is not removed.

The program will output `MAYBE` for this input, which is correct. However, the program does not correctly handle the following input:
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 3 3
```

- The favorite cube is the second cube with a value of 3.
- After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
- The program will count the number of times the value 3 is removed, which is 2.
- The program will output `YES` because it assumes that all cubes with the favorite value are removed, which is incorrect.

In this case, the favorite cube may or may not be removed, so the correct output should be `MAYBE`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
