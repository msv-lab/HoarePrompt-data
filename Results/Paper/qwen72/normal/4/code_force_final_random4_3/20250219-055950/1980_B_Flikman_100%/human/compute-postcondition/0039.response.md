The value of `removed_count` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `removed_count` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`. After the increment, `removed_count` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the value of `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, `removed_count` is either 1 or 2.**
