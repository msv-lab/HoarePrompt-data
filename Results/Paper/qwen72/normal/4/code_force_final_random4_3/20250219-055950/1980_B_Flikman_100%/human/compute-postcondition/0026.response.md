Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k - 1`, `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` remains unchanged. If `removed_count` is 0, `removed_count` remains 0. If `removed_count` is not 0, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.***
