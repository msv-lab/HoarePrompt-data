Postcondition: ***`k` is the input integer, `i` is `k - 1`. If any of the first `k` elements in `sorted_a` are equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is increased by the number of such occurrences. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged. `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, it remains unchanged. If `removed_count` is less than `favorite_count`, it may be increased or remain unchanged based on the occurrences of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements, but it will not be 0 if it was initially not 0.***
