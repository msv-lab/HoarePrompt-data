Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `removed_count` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `removed_count` is incremented by 1, while the values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `removed_count` remains unchanged unless the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value` is not relevant to this code snippet, so `removed_count` is simply increased by 1.
