Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not 1, the program continues without breaking.**
