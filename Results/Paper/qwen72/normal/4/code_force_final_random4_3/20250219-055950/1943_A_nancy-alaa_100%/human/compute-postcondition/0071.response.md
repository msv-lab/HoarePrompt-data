Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `first` is True if `mpp` contains at least one key with a value of 1, otherwise `first` is False.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i` is `n + 1`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `n + 1`. This is because the loop iterates from `0` to `n` (inclusive), and the final value of `i` will be the next integer, which is `n + 1`.
- **`n` is a positive integer**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop body.
- **`first` is True if `mpp` contains at least one key with a value of 1, otherwise `first` is False**: The variable `first` is set to `True` the first time the loop encounters a key `i` in `mpp` where `mpp[i]` is `1`. If no such key is found, `first` remains `False`. After the loop completes, `first` will be `True` if at least one key in `mpp` has a value of `1`, and `False` otherwise.
