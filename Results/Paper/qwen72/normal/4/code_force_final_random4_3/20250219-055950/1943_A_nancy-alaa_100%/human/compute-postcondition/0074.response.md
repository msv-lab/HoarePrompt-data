The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part into an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `arr`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer, `first` is True if `mpp` contains at least one key with a value of 1, otherwise `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
