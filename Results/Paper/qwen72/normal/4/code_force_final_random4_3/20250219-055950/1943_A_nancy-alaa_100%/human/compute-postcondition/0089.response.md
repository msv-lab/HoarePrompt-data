The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition that `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure that `i` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**
