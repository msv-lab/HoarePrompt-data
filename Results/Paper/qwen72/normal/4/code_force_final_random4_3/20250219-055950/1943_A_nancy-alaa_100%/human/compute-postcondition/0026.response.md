The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition `i < n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2, and `first` is False.**
