Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 2, `y` is `n - 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `r` is `a[2] + (k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, and `k` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
