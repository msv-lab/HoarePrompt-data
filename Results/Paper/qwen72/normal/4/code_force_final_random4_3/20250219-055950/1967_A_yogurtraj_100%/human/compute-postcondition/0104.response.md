The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, and `r` is `a[0]` or `a[1]` depending on the conditions in the loop body.**
