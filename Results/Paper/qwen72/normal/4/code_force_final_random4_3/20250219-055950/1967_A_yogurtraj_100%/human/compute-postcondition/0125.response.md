Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `ii` is 2.
- `i` is `n - 2`, where `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `k` is not 0.
- `y` is the number of elements in `a` that were not processed due to the loop breaking.
- `rem` is the remainder of `k` when divided by the last processed index + 1.
- `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n`**:
   - `n` is the first integer input by the user. Let's denote this value as `n`.

2. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`. This means `i` is the second-to-last index of the list `a`.

3. **Determine `r`**:
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

4. **Determine `rem`**:
   - `rem` is the remainder of `k` when divided by the last processed index + 1.
   - The last processed index is `i`, which is `n - 2`.
   - Therefore, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`.

5. **Determine the Expression**:
   - The expression to be printed is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.
   - Substitute `r` with `a[n - 1] + k // n`:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n
     \]
     \[
     (a[n - 1] * n + k // n * n - n) + 1 + k % n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + k % n
     \]

6. **Final Simplification**:
   - Since `k % n` is the remainder of `k` when divided by `n`, it is a value between 0 and `n-1`.
   - The expression can be further simplified to:
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + k % n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + (k - (k // n) * n)
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + k - (k // n) * n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n + k - k
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n
     \]

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of the expression `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n`.

Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 - n (where `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `n` is the first integer input by the user, and `k` is a non-zero integer)**
