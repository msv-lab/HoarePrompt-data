Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `rem` to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition that `rem` is now 0.
