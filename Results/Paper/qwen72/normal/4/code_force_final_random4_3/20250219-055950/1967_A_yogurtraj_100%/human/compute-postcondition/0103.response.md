Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, and `r` is `a[0]`. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then `k` is set to 0, `y` is set to `n - 1`, and `r` is set to `a[0] + k // 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is set to the second integer input by the user minus the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` multiplied by 1, and `r` is set to `a[1]`.***
