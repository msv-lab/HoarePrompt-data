You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer input for the last test case, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user for the last test case, `r` is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks or completes. If `k` is not 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`. If the loop breaks, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i` (the number of elements remaining in the list after the break), and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`. If the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the remaining value after all subtractions, and `r` is the last element of the list `a`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks or completes, and `k` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a long integer `k`, along with a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` and then iterates through it to find a specific value `r` and a remainder `rem`. The function calculates and prints a result for each test case, which is a combination of `r`, `n`, `rem`, and `y` (the number of elements remaining in the list after a certain condition is met). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and a result has been printed for each one. The variables `ii`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` are in their final states as described in the annotated code.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of coins \( k \) is exactly enough to make all the counts of cards equal to the maximum count. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 3
1 2 3
```

The initial counts of cards are \( a = [1, 2, 3] \). The program should be able to buy 3 cards to make the counts equal to 3 for all types, resulting in \( a = [3, 3, 3] \). This would allow for the maximum score of 3, as there are 3 subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of \([1, 2, 3]\).

However, the program's logic breaks down in this case. It sorts the array and then tries to distribute the coins to make the counts as equal as possible. When \( k \) is exactly enough to make all counts equal to the maximum count, the program does not correctly handle the distribution and may end up with an incorrect score.

To illustrate, let's walk through the program with the input:

1. \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
2. \( a = [1, 2, 3] \) (sorted)
3. The program will try to distribute the coins:
   - \( i = 0 \): \( (0 + 1) * (2 - 1) = 1 \) (1 coin is used to make \( a[0] = 2 \))
   - \( i = 1 \): \( (1 + 1) * (3 - 2) = 2 \) (2 coins are used to make \( a[1] = 3 \))
   - \( k = 0 \) after these operations, but the program does not correctly handle the final score calculation.

The program will output an incorrect score in this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
