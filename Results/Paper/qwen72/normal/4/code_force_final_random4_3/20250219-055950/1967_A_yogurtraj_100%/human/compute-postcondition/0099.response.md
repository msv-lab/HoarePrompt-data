Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
