Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1` which is now `a[0] + 0 // 1` (so `r` is `a[0]`), `rem` is `k % 1` which is now `0 % 1` (so `rem` is 0), `y` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k) is true.**
