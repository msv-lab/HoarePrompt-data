Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is 0, `y` is the number of elements in `a` that were not processed due to the loop breaking, `rem` is the remainder of `k` when divided by the last processed index + 1, and `r` is the last processed element in `a` or the result of `a[last_processed_index] + (k - (last_processed_index + 1) * (a[last_processed_index + 1] - a[last_processed_index])) // (last_processed_index + 1)` if the loop broke due to the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. Additionally, `k` is 0.**
