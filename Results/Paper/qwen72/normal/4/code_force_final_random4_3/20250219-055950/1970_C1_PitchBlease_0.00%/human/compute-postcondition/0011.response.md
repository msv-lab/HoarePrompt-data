Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` contains the integers `start` and `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor.***
