The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor`, `tree`, and `current`. The loop iterates over the neighbors of the current node, which is stored in `tree[current]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`.
- `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.
- If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, 1)`, `visited` contains the integers `start` and `neighbor`, and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor.
- If `neighbor` is in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged.
- In both cases, `current` is equal to `start` and `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `neighbor` must be available in `tree[current]`. Since `current` is `start` and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor, the next `neighbor` will be the next element in the list `tree[start]`.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `tree[start]` must have at least one more neighbor.**
