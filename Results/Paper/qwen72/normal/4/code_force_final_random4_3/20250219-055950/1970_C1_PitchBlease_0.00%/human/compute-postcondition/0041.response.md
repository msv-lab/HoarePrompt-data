Output State: **The program returns the distance `dist` associated with the current node `current` from the `start` node. If `current` equals `target`, this distance is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph represented by `tree`. If `current` does not equal `target`, the returned distance is the distance to the first node processed from the `queue` after the first element was removed.**
