The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor` and `tree[current]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `tree[current]` having neighbors. If `tree[current]` has at least one neighbor, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tree[current]` must still have at least one neighbor that hasn't been processed yet. After the last iteration, `neighbor` was the next neighbor in `tree[current]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` will be the second neighbor in `tree[current]`.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, but with the first element removed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop, plus the `neighbor` that was just added. `current` is now the first neighbor that was in the `queue` before the operation, and `dist` is the distance associated with that neighbor. `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
