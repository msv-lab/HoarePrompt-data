The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor` and `tree[current]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the neighbors of the current node, which is `current`. At the end of the last iteration, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree[current]` must still have at least one more neighbor that hasn't been processed yet.

Since the loop iterates over `tree[current]`, the next state will be the next neighbor in the list of `tree[current]`. The state of `current` remains unchanged, and `tree[current]` must still have at least one more neighbor for the loop to continue.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` contains the integers `start` and `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor.**
