Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have occurred based on the given scores. Here's why:

1. The total points (a + b + c) should be even, which the solution correctly checks. If the total points are odd, it prints -1, which is correct.
2. However, the solution calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`, and then prints `min(x, y)`. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the constraints of the game and the possible distributions of wins and draws.

To correctly determine the maximum number of draws, we need to ensure that the points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = a + b + c
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_wins = total_points // 2
        if c > total_wins * 2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        max_draws = total_wins - (c - a - b)
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Explanation:
1. **Total Points Check**: If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so we print -1.
2. **Total Wins Calculation**: The total number of wins (or games that ended in a win) is `total_points // 2`.
3. **Consistency Check**: We check if the highest score `c` is more than twice the total number of wins. If it is, then it's impossible to achieve the scores, so we print -1.
4. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is calculated as `total_wins - (c - a - b)`. This ensures that the remaining points after accounting for the highest score can be distributed as draws.

This corrected solution should handle all the test cases correctly.
