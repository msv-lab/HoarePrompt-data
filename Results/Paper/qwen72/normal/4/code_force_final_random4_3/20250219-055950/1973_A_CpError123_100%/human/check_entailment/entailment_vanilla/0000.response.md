### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total number of points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.

3. **Calculate Total Points:**
   - The program calculates `x` as half of the total points `(a + b + c) // 2`. This is because the total number of points is always even, and each game (whether a win/loss or a draw) contributes 2 points.

4. **Calculate Maximum Draws:**
   - The program calculates `y` as the sum of the scores of the two lowest players `(a + b)`.
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because:
     - `x` represents the total number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points).
     - `y` represents the maximum number of draws possible if all draws were between the two lowest players (since each draw gives 1 point to each player).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

### Analysis of the Example Cases:

1. **Input: 0 0 0**
   - Sum: 0 (even)
   - Total points: 0
   - Maximum draws: 0 (since no points were scored, no games were played)
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

2. **Input: 0 1 1**
   - Sum: 2 (even)
   - Total points: 1 (1 draw)
   - Maximum draws: 1 (since the only way to get 1 point each for two players is a draw)
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

3. **Input: 1 1 1**
   - Sum: 3 (odd)
   - Output: -1 (Correct, since the sum is odd, the scores are invalid)

4. **Input: 1 1 2**
   - Sum: 4 (even)
   - Total points: 2 (2 draws or 1 win/loss and 1 draw)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (since 2 draws can give 1 point each to the two lowest players and 2 points to the highest player)
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

5. **Input: 3 3 3**
   - Sum: 9 (odd)
   - Output: -1 (Correct, since the sum is odd, the scores are invalid)

6. **Input: 3 4 5**
   - Sum: 12 (even)
   - Total points: 6 (6 draws or 3 win/loss and 3 draws)
   - Maximum draws: 6 (since 6 draws can give 3 points each to all players)
   - Output: 6 (Correct)

7. **Input: 1 1 10**
   - Sum: 12 (even)
   - Total points: 6 (6 draws or 3 win/loss and 3 draws)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (since 2 draws can give 1 point each to the two lowest players and the rest can be win/loss games)
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks for valid scores, and calculates the maximum number of draws. It also correctly prints `-1` for invalid scores. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
