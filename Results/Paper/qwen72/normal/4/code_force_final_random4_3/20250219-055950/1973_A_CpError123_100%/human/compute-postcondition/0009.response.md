Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
2. `t` is greater than 0.
3. `_` is 0.
4. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
5. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
6. `x` is assigned the value \((a + b + c) // 2\).
7. `y` is assigned the value \(a + b\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(min(x, y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input for `a`, `b`, and `c`**:
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided by the user.
   - If the sum \(a + b + c\) is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. This means that the `print` statement will only execute if the sum \(a + b + c\) is even.

2. **Calculation of `x`**:
   - `x` is calculated as \((a + b + c) // 2\).
   - Since \(a + b + c\) is even, \((a + b + c) // 2\) will be an integer.

3. **Calculation of `y`**:
   - `y` is calculated as \(a + b\).

4. **Determine the Minimum**:
   - The `print` statement will output the minimum of `x` and `y`.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will print the minimum value between \((a + b + c) // 2\) and \(a + b\).
- Since \(a + b + c\) is even, \((a + b + c) // 2\) is an integer.
- The value of \(a + b\) is also an integer.

Output: **min((a + b + c) // 2, a + b) (where a, b, and c are integers provided by user input, and the sum a + b + c is even)**
