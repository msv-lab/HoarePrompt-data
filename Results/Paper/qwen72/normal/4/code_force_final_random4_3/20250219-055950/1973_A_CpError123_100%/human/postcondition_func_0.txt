The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input, representing the scores of three players. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2, and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
