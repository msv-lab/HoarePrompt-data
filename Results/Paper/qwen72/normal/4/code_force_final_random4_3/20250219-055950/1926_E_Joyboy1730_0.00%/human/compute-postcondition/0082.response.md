The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `pow` is `2^(t - 1)`, `a` is undefined, `n` is `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
