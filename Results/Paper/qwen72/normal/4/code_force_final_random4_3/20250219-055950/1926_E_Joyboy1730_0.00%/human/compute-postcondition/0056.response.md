To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`, let's break down the initial state and the expression step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element.
   - `a` is the first element in the list `L`.
   - `tot` is less than `k`.
   - `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)` involves two variables: `pow` and `k`.
   - `pow` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code.
   - `k` is defined as a value that is greater than `tot` and less than or equal to `tot + a`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `pow` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `k` is a value that fits the condition `tot < k <= tot + a`.
   - The expression `2 * k - 1` will be a value that is dependent on the value of `k`.

Given the initial state and the expression, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **pow * (2 * k - 1) (where pow is the value of pow, and k is a value such that tot < k <= tot + a)**
