The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally handle or process multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to return or produce some result based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. It returns a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.**
