Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `pow` is `2^(t - 1)`, `a` is undefined, `n` is 0, `m` is 0.**

The code snippet `tot = 0` reassigns the variable `tot` to 0, but since `tot` was already 0 in the initial state, the value of `tot` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this code, so their states remain the same as in the initial state.
