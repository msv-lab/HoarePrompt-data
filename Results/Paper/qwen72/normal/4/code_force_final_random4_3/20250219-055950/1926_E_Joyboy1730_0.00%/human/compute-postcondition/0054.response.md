The only objects in the loop head are the list `L` and the variable `a`. For the loop to execute, `L` must contain at least one element. Since `L` is currently an empty list, it needs to be adjusted to contain at least one element. The variable `a` will be the first element of `L` at the start of the loop.

State: **`L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list**
