Output State: **`L` is a list with at least `t - 1` elements, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `pow` is `2^(t - 1)`, `a` is the last element in `L` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `a` is the element in `L` that satisfies `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
