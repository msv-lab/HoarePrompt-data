Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is a list that must have at least `len(L)` elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations + 1, `a` is the last element in the list `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` at any iteration, the loop breaks and prints `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is 0 and `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration.
- The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively.
- After this code, `n` and `k` are updated to the input values, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
