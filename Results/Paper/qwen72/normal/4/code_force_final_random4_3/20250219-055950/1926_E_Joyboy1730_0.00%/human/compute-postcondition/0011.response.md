Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`**

The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
