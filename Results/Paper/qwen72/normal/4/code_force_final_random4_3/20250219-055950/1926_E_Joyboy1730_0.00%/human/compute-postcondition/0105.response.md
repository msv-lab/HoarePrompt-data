Output State: **`L` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is updated to `tot + a`, `k` is updated to `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is updated to `2 * pow`, and if `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
