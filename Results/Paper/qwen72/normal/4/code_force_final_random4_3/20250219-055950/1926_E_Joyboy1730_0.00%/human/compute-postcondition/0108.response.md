Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `L` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements.
- `a` is the third element in `L`.
- `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.
- `k` is updated to `k - (tot + a)`.
- `pow` is updated to `4 * pow`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `L` is a list with at least 3 elements. Let's denote the elements of `L` as `L = [L[0], L[1], L[2], ...]`.
   - `a` is the third element in `L`, so `a = L[2]`.
   - `tot` is a variable that is updated to `tot + a`.
   - `k` is a variable that is updated to `k - (tot + a)`.
   - `pow` is a variable that is updated to `4 * pow`.

2. **Update `tot`:**
   - `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `tot` as `tot_initial`.
   - After the update, `tot = tot_initial + a`.

3. **Update `k`:**
   - `k` is updated to `k - (tot + a)`.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `k` as `k_initial`.
   - After the update, `k = k_initial - (tot_initial + a)`.
   - Simplifying, `k = k_initial - tot_initial - a`.

4. **Update `pow`:**
   - `pow` is updated to `4 * pow`.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `pow` as `pow_initial`.
   - After the update, `pow = 4 * pow_initial`.

5. **Expression in the `print` statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.
   - Substitute the updated values of `pow` and `k`:
     - `pow = 4 * pow_initial`
     - `k = k_initial - tot_initial - a`
   - The expression becomes:
     - `4 * pow_initial * (2 * (k_initial - tot_initial - a) - 1)`
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     - `2 * (k_initial - tot_initial - a) - 1 = 2 * k_initial - 2 * tot_initial - 2 * a - 1`
   - Therefore, the final expression is:
     - `4 * pow_initial * (2 * k_initial - 2 * tot_initial - 2 * a - 1)`

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of the expression `4 * pow_initial * (2 * k_initial - 2 * tot_initial - 2 * a - 1)`, where:
- `pow_initial` is the initial value of `pow`.
- `k_initial` is the initial value of `k`.
- `tot_initial` is the initial value of `tot`.
- `a` is the third element in the list `L`.

Output: **4 * pow_initial * (2 * k_initial - 2 * tot_initial - 2 * a - 1) (where pow_initial is the initial value of pow, k_initial is the initial value of k, tot_initial is the initial value of tot, and a is the third element in the list L)**
