The only objects in the loop head are the variable `a` and the list `L`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `L`. If `L` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `L` must have at least 1 element, and `a` is the first element in the list `L`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `L` must have at least 2 elements, and `a` will be the second element in the list `L`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - a`, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `a` is the second element in the list `L`**
