Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **List `L` is never populated**: The list `L` is initialized but never actually filled with any values. This means that the loop `for a in L:` will never execute, and the program will not reach the point where it prints the result.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining the order of cards**: The program attempts to calculate the number of cards in the current step using the formula `m = (n + 1) // 2` and then subtracts `m` from `n`. However, this logic is not used to populate `L` or to determine the correct card at position `k`.

3. **Incorrect adjustment of `k`**: The program incorrectly adjusts `k` by subtracting `tot` from it, which is not the correct way to move to the next position in the sequence.

4. **Incorrect print statement**: The print statement `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))` is not correctly implemented to find the `k`-th card in the sequence.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

- Determine the number of odd cards, then the number of cards that are twice an odd number, and so on.
- Keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down and adjust `k` accordingly.
- Print the correct card number based on the adjusted `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        pow = 1
        while True:
            m = (n + 1) // 2  # Number of cards in the current step
            if k <= m:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            k -= m
            pow += 1
            n -= m

func()
```

This corrected version will correctly determine the `k`-th card laid down by Vladislav.
