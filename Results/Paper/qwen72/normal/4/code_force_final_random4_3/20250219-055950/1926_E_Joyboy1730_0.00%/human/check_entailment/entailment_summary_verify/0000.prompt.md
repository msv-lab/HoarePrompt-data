You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

    7 1
    
    7 2
    
    7 3

    34 14
    
    84 19
    
    1000000000 1000000000

Output

    1
    3
    5
    7
    2
    6
    4
    1
    27

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `n` is 0 for all test cases, `k` is modified to `k - tot` after the last iteration for each test case, `L` is a non-empty list with elements generated during the execution, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` for each test case, and `pow` is either `2^len(L)` if the loop did not break or `2^(i+1)` where `i` is the index of the element in `L` that caused the loop to break.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process of laying down the cards. The program initializes an empty list `L` and then enters a loop that reduces `n` but does not actually populate `L` with the correct values. As a result, the subsequent logic that attempts to use `L` to determine the k-th card laid down will not work as intended.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 1
```
The program should output `1` because the first card laid down is `1`. However, the program will not produce the correct output because `L` remains empty, and the logic to determine the k-th card is flawed. The program will likely enter an infinite loop or produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
