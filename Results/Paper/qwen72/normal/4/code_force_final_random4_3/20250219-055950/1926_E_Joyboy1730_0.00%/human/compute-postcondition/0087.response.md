Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `pow` is `2^(t - 1)`, `a` is undefined, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2` as per the initial state. The other variables `L`, `tot`, `k`, `pow`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is now equal to the integer division of `n + 1` by 2.
