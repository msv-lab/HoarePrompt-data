Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
- The number of test cases `t` is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
- The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `2`**: This is a constant integer value.
2. **Value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 3.
3. **Value of `*range(n, 0, -1)`**: This is a range that generates a sequence of integers from `n` down to 1, inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Explanation:
- The `print` function will output the integer 2, followed by the integer 3 (the value of `i`), and then the sequence of integers from `n` down to 1.
- For example, if `n` is 5, the range `range(5, 0, -1)` will generate the sequence [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer 2, followed by the integer 3, and then the sequence of integers from `n` down to 1, inclusive.

Output: **2, 3, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1 (where n is the input integer and n ≥ 3)**
