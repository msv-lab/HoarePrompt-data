The function `func_1` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) that represents the size of a matrix. The number of test cases `t` is also given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. The function is expected to return the results for each test case, but the specific return values are not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. It returns results for each test case, but the exact nature of these results is not specified.**
