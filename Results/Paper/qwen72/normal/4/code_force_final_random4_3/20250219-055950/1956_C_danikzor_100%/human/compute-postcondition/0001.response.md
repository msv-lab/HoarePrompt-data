To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
- The number of test cases `t` is given, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Expression: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`**
   - This expression calculates a value based on the input integer `n`.
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is a mathematical formula that computes the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The `//` operator performs integer division, which means the result will be an integer.

2. **Second Expression: `2 * n`**
   - This expression simply multiplies the input integer `n` by 2.
   - The result will be an integer.

### Explanation of the Output:
- The `print` statement will output two values separated by a comma.
- The first value is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which represents the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
- The second value is `2 * n`, which is simply twice the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6], [2 * n] (where n is the input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive)**

This output provides the precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
