### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either assign a permutation to a row or a column.
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the maximum possible value, which is \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_1` reads the size of the matrix \( n \) and prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - The maximum sum is calculated using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \).
   - The number of operations is \( 2 \times n \).
   - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it prints two operations: one for the row and one for the column, both using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

3. **Evaluating the Formula:**
   - The formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum.
   - The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Evaluating the Operations:**
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation uses the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is a valid permutation.
   - However, the operations do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. The permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) does not ensure that the sum is maximized because it does not distribute the values optimally.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The correct maximum sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 6 \).
     - The program outputs 7, which is incorrect.
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     - The correct maximum sum should be \( 1 \times \frac{1 \times 2}{2} = 1 \).
     - The program outputs 1, which is correct.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect.
   - The operations performed by the program do not guarantee the maximum sum for all \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum and the operations it performs do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.
