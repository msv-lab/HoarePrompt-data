Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix. The formula used in the program to calculate the sum, `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

For example, when \( n = 2 \), the correct maximum sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 6 \), but the program outputs 7. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not follow the problem description correctly for this input.
