The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 1 and go up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
- The number of test cases `t` is still given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
- The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already given to be between 1 and 500, inclusive, the loop will execute without any adjustments to `n`.

However, the initial state of `i` is not explicitly mentioned, but it will be set by the loop itself to start from 1. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; the number of test cases `t` is still given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `i` starts at 1**
