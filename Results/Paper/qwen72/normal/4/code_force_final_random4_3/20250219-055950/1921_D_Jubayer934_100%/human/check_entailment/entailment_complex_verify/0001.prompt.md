You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: `t` is 0, `a_i` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `temp` is not -1, then `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`, and `ans` also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` in a specific order: initially, it pairs elements from the start of `a` with elements from the start of `b` in descending order. If at any point the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element from the end of `b` is greater than the difference with the current element of `b`, it switches to pairing elements from the start of `a` with elements from the end of `b` for the remaining elements. The function prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the final state includes the processed lists `a` and `b` for each test case, and the list `ans` containing the absolute differences.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` which represent the lengths of Petya's array and the available integers for Vasya, respectively.
   - It then reads and sorts Petya's array `a` and Vasya's available integers `b` in descending order.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is a good strategy because it helps in maximizing the difference between corresponding elements.
   - By sorting `a` in ascending order, we ensure that the smallest elements of `a` are paired with the largest elements of `b` (and vice versa) to maximize the absolute differences.

3. **Initial Pairing:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `b` (since `m >= n` and we only need `n` elements from `b`).
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in `b` and appends it to `ans`.

4. **Optimal Pairing Adjustment:**
   - The function checks if there is a better way to pair the elements of `a` with the elements of `b` by comparing the absolute differences of the current pairing with the reverse pairing.
   - If the reverse pairing (`b[-(n - i)]`) results in a larger absolute difference, it stops the initial pairing and starts the reverse pairing from that point.
   - This adjustment ensures that the function maximizes the total difference `D`.

5. **Summing the Differences:**
   - After all the absolute differences are calculated and stored in `ans`, the function prints the sum of the differences for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The initial approach of pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` is a good starting point to maximize the absolute differences.
  - The adjustment step ensures that if the reverse pairing provides a better result, it is used instead.
  - The function correctly handles the constraints and the multiple test cases.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles cases where all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case where `b` is all 1s).
  - It also handles cases where `n` is equal to `m` and where `n` is less than `m`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting operations are efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(m \log m)\).
  - The overall complexity is \(O(t \cdot (n \log n + m \log m))\), which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
