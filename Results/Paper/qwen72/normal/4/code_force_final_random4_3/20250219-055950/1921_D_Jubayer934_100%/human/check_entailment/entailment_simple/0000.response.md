### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Slicing**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order and then the first `n` elements are taken.
   - The list `b` is sorted in descending order and then the first `m` elements are taken. This ensures that the largest elements of `b` are considered first, which is a good strategy for maximizing the difference.

3. **Initial Difference Calculation**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and `b` and calculates the absolute difference `|a[i] - b[i]|` for each pair, appending the result to `ans`.

4. **Optimization Check**:
   - The function checks if there is a point where the difference `|a[i] - b[-(n - i)]|` (i.e., the difference between `a[i]` and the `i`-th largest element in `b`) is greater than `|a[i] - b[i]`.
   - If such a point is found, it breaks the loop and sets `temp` to the current index `i`.

5. **Final Difference Calculation**:
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, it means that the function found a point where the difference can be maximized by using the `i`-th largest element in `b` instead of the `i`-th smallest element.
   - The function then iterates from `temp` to `n-1` and calculates the absolute difference `|a[i] - b[-(n - i)]|`, appending the result to `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sum of the absolute differences stored in `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm aims to maximize the total difference \( D \) by considering the largest elements of `b` first and then checking if using the smallest elements of `b` for the remaining elements of `a` can yield a larger difference.
  - The logic of breaking the loop when a better difference is found and then continuing with the remaining elements is a valid approach to maximize the difference.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same (as in the second test case) correctly, resulting in a total difference of 0.
  - The function also handles the case where `n` is equal to `m` correctly (as in the third and sixth test cases).

- **Complexity**:
  - The sorting operations are \( O(n \log n) \) and \( O(m \log m) \), which are efficient given the constraints.
  - The overall complexity is \( O(t \cdot (n \log n + m \log m)) \), which is acceptable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \) between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
