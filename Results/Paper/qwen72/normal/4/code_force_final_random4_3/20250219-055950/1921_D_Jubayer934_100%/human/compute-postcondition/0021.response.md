The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, the code will compute `abs(a[2] - b[2])` and append this value to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing three elements, where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, the second element is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and the third element is the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `temp` remains -1.**
