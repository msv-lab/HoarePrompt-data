Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is not met, and now `ans` also contains the value `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[i-1] - b[-(n - (i-1))])`, and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not -1, `i` is `temp + 3`, `temp` must be less than `n`**.
