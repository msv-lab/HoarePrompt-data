Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `k` is 5999999999. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 99999999999, 1999999999, 199999999999999, 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 200000000000, 2147483648, 1000000000000, 100000000000, 1000000000. `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 5, 20, 101, or 1000000000. If `n` is 1000000000, then `a` is not equal to [1000000000, 1000000000].**
