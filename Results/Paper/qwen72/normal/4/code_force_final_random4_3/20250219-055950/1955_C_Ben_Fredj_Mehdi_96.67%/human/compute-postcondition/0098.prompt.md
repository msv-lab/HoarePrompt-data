Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`, `k` is not equal to 99999999999, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, `k` is not equal to 9999999999, `n` is not equal to 101, `k` is not equal to 100000000000, `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, `k` is not equal to 99999999999999, `k` is not equal to 199999999999999, `k` is not equal to 1000000000000, `k` is not equal to 200000000000, `k` is not equal to 2147483648, `n` is not equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 5, `k` is not equal to 2147483648, `n` is not equal to 20, `k` is not equal to 10000000000, `k` is not equal to 5999999999, `k` is not equal to 4294967295, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1`, `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers. If no exception occurs, the first element of `a` is decremented by 1, and the last element of `a` is decremented by 1. If the first element becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the last element becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, no changes are made to the elements of `a`, `g`, or `d`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at the following points:
1. When attempting to access `a[g]` or `a[d]` if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`.
2. When attempting to convert `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer if the elements at these indices are not convertible to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at the indices `g` and `d` in the list `a`. If the value at `a[g]` or `a[d]` becomes 0 after decrementing, the respective index `g` or `d` is adjusted (`g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` is 0, and `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` is 0). If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k // 2` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If no exception occurs, `a[d]` is now `int(a[d]) - 1` and `a[g]` is now `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[d]` was 0 after decrementing, `d` is decremented by 1. If `a[g]` is 0 after decrementing, `g` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k // 2` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If no exception occurs, `a[d]` is now `int(a[d]) - 1` and `a[g]` is now `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[g]` was 0 after decrementing, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` was 0 after decrementing, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
