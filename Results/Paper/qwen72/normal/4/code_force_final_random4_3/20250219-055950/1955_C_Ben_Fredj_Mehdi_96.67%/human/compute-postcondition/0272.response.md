Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, and `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space. If `k == 5999999999`, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `k == 4294967295`, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `n == 2` and `k == a[0] - 1` and `k == a[1] - 2`, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is 3000000000, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than 3000000000, less than the sum of all integers in `a`, and `k` is at least 2, and if `k` is odd, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1` (or the loop could have broken due to an exception), `a[g]` is decremented by 1, and `a[d]`, `g`, and `d` remain unchanged.***
