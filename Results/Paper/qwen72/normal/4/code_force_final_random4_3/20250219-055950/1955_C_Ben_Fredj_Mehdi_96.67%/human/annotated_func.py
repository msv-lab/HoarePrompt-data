#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the corresponding output has been printed based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` for each iteration remain unchanged after the output is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from a single input line, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` from another input line. The function processes each test case and prints a result based on specific conditions involving `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`. If `k` matches certain predefined values, a specific result is printed. Otherwise, the function attempts to decrement elements from both ends of the list `a` until `k` is exhausted, and then prints the number of zeros in the list `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
