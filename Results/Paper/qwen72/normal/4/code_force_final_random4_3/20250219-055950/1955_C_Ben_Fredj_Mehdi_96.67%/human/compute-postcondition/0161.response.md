The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be at least 2 to ensure `k // 2` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
