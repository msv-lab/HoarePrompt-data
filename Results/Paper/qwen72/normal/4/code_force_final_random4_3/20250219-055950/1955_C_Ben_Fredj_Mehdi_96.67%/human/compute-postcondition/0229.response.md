Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(a))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a`**:
   - `a` is described as a list of integers provided by the new input. This means `a` is a list, and its elements are integers.
   - The exact length of `a` is not specified in the initial state, but it is a list of integers.

2. **Understanding `len(a)`**:
   - The `len(a)` function returns the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a list of integers, `len(a)` will be an integer representing the number of elements in `a`.

### Final Output:
The `print(len(a))` statement will print the length of the list `a`, which is the number of elements in the list.

Output: **len(a) (where len(a) is the number of elements in the list a)**
