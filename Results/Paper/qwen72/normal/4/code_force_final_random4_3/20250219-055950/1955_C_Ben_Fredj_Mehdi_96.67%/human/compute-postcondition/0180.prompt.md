Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `d` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0, and an error occurs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 2, and `i` is 0. If `a[d]` is 0, `d` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2, and the last integer in the list `a` is now `a[d]` minus 1. If `a[g]` is 0, `g` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `g` remains 0. If `a[d]` is not 0, `d` remains equal to the length of `a` minus 1, and the last integer in the list `a` is now `a[d]` minus 1. If an exception occurs (e.g., index out of range or type conversion error), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of `a`, `g`, and `d` may be partially or fully updated depending on how far the `try` block was able to execute before the exception.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If no exception occurs, the elements at indices `g` and `d` in `a` are decremented by 1. If the element at index `g` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `d` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and no changes are made to `a`, `g`, or `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The exception in the `try` block could occur at the lines where the list `a` is accessed and modified, specifically `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. These lines could raise an `IndexError` if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`, or a `ValueError` if the elements at `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the `except` block will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 4, `i` is 2. If no exception occurs, the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are decremented by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
