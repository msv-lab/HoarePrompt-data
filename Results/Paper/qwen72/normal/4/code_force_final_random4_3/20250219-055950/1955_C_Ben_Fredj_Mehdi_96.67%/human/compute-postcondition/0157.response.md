Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `d` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2, `k` must be at least 2, and `i` is 0; the last integer in the list `a` is now `a[d]` minus 1, and `a[d]` is 0. If `a[g]` is 0, `g` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `g` remains 0.**
