The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('10000')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `z` is 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'10000'`.
   - The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement.

3. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a fixed string, the output will be exactly `'10000'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **10000**
