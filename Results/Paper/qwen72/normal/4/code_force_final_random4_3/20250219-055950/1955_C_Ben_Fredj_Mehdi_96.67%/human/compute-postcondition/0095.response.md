Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k // 2` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a[d]` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[d]` was 0 after decrementing, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `g` remains unchanged. If `a[d]` was 0 before decrementing, `d` is now `d - 1`. If `a[d]` was not 0 before decrementing, `d` remains unchanged.***
