The code snippet `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` modifies the list `a` by decrementing the value at index `g` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `g`, so we cannot determine the exact index that is modified. We can only state that the value at index `g` in the list `a` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 4, `i` is 2, the value at index `g` in the list `a` is decremented by 1.**
