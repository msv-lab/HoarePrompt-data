Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the input. If `k` is 1999999998, an error occurs. If `k` is 1999999999, an error occurs. If `k` is one of the values 99999999999, 10000000000000, 9999999999, 100000000000, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 3000000000, 199999999999999, 2147483648 with the first element of `a` being 2, or 4294967295, an error occurs. If `k` is 2147483648 and the first element of `a` is 2, the state of `a` and `g` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 1999999998, not 1999999999, not 2147483648 with the first element of `a` being 2, and `k` is less than the sum of the list `a`, `k` must be at least 2. In this case, the first element of `a` is the first integer in the list `a` minus the number of times the loop executed, and `i` is `k // 2 - 1`. If `k` is an odd number, the element at index `g` in `a` is decremented by 1, and if this element becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `k` is an even number, the state of `a` and `g` remains unchanged.***
