An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at several points:

1. When attempting to access `a[g]` or `a[d]` if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`.
2. When attempting to convert `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer if the elements at these indices are not valid integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` of the list `a` by 1. If either value becomes 0, the corresponding index (`g` or `d`) is adjusted (`g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` is 0, and `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` is 0). If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k // 2` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If no exception occurs, `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decremented by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
