Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is an odd number correctly. Specifically, the permutation generated by the program for odd `n` does not ensure that there are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. 

For example, consider `n = 5`:
- The program generates the permutation `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- Here, `p_1 = 5` and `p_3 = 3` do not divide each other, but `p_2 = 2` and `p_4 = 4` do divide each other, and `p_3 = 3` and `p_5 = 1` do not divide each other. However, the condition `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` is violated for `i = 1` and `j = 3` because `p_2 = 2` divides `p_4 = 4`.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
