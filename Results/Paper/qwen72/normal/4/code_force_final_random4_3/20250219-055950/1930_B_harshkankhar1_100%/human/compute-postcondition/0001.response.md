Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, with all the odd-indexed elements (considering 0-based indexing) reversed in their positions.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range 3 to 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at the odd indices (0-based) of the list `a`.
- The elements at even indices (0-based) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state retains the value of `n` and the list `a`, but with the odd-indexed elements reversed.
