Based on the precondition and the provided code snippet, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer.
   - The current value of `k` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer value 1.
   - The values of `n` and `k` are not used in this print statement.
   - The value of `_` is also not used in this print statement.
   - The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 does not affect the print statement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The print statement will output the integer 1.

Output: **1**
