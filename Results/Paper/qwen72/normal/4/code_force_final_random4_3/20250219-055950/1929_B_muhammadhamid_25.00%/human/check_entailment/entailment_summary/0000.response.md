Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and processes each pair of integers `n` and `k` as described in the problem statement.

2. **Base Case for \( k = 1 \)**: 
   - If \( k = 1 \), the program prints `1`. This is correct because even if \( n \) is large, you only need to color one cell to satisfy the condition of having at least one diagonal with a colored cell.

3. **Case for \( k \leq 2n \)**:
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because in a \( n \times n \) grid, you can color cells along the main diagonals (both the primary and secondary diagonals) to cover up to \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals. To cover \( k \) diagonals, you need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells. This is because each cell can contribute to at most 2 diagonals, and you need to ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

4. **Case for \( k > 2n \)**:
   - For \( k > 2n \), the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is correct because when \( k \) exceeds \( 2n \), you need to cover more than the main diagonals. The formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that you cover the additional diagonals by coloring more cells. The `+ 1` accounts for the fact that you need one more cell to cover the remaining diagonal when \( k \) is odd.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if \( k = 2n \), it will print `n`, which is the correct number of cells needed to cover all main diagonals.
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), the maximum number of diagonals, the program will print `2n - 1`, which is the correct number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

6. **General Correctness**:
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to color is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements. The program uses the correct mathematical operations to determine the minimum number of cells needed for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
