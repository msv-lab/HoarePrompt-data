### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is 1, it prints 1. This is correct because coloring one cell will ensure at least one diagonal has a colored cell.
   - If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it prints the ceiling of \( k / 2 \). This is because in the worst case, you can color cells along the main and anti-diagonals, and each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.
   - If \( k \) is greater than \( 2n \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because after covering the \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells, you need to cover the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals, and each additional cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - For \( k = 1 \), the solution is trivially correct.
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the ceiling of \( k / 2 \) is the minimum number of cells needed. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, and you need to cover \( k \) diagonals.
   - For \( k > 2n \), the solution \( k // 2 + 1 \) is correct. After covering \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells, you need to cover the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals, and each additional cell can cover at most 2 diagonals. Therefore, you need \( (k - 2n) // 2 \) additional cells, plus the \( n \) cells already used, which simplifies to \( k // 2 + 1 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) correctly.
   - The program handles the case where \( k \leq 2n \) correctly.
   - The program handles the case where \( k > 2n \) correctly.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case correctly.
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the given logic.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
