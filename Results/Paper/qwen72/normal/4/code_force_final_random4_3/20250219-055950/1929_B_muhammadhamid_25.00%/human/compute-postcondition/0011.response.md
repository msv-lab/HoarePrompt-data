The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's continuation is determined by the range of `int(input())`, which specifies how many times the loop should iterate. At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the current value of `k` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`. Otherwise, `k` is greater than `2 * n`.**
