Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Base Case (a >= b)**: If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, the program correctly calculates the total profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price will yield the maximum profit in this scenario.

3. **Optimal k Calculation (a < b)**: If the usual price `a` is less than the modified price `b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The value of `k` is set to `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a price greater than or equal to `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation for Modified Prices**: The program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula correctly computes the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.

5. **Profit Calculation for Usual Prices**: The program calculates the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` using the formula `(n - k) * a`.

6. **Total Profit**: The program correctly adds the two profits together and prints the result.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the cases where `n`, `a`, and `b` are at their minimum and maximum values. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
