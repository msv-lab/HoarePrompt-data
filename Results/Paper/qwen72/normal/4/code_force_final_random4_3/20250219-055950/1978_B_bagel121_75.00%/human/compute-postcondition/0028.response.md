The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might interact with external inputs or variables. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function's output is not specified, but it is likely to return a result based on these inputs.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function definition, we can infer that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and returns a result for each test case. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
