### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by reading `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Base Case (a >= b)**:
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, the program correctly calculates the total profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price will yield the maximum profit in this scenario. This part of the logic is accurate.

3. **Optimal k Calculation (a < b)**:
   - If the usual price `a` is less than the modified price `b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The value of `k` is set to `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a price greater than or equal to `a`. This part of the logic is also correct.

4. **Profit Calculation for Modified Prices**:
   - The program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula correctly computes the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is \(\frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))\), which simplifies to \(\frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1)\). The program's formula is equivalent and correct.

5. **Profit Calculation for Usual Prices**:
   - The program calculates the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` using the formula `(n - k) * a`. This is straightforward and correct.

6. **Total Profit**:
   - The program correctly adds the two profits together and prints the result. This ensures that the total profit is the sum of the profits from the modified and usual prices.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The program handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\) and \(1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9\) appropriately.
- It correctly handles the case where `k` can be 0, meaning no buns are sold at the modified price.
- The arithmetic and integer division operations are performed correctly, ensuring that the results are as expected.

### Example Verification:
- For the test case `4 4 5`:
  - `a < b`, so `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
  - Modified price profit: \(\frac{2}{2} \times (5 + 4) = 9\).
  - Usual price profit: \((4 - 2) \times 4 = 8\).
  - Total profit: \(9 + 8 = 17\). This matches the expected output.

- For the test case `5 5 9`:
  - `a < b`, so `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
  - Modified price profit: \(\frac{5}{2} \times (9 + 5) = 35\).
  - Usual price profit: \((5 - 5) \times 5 = 0\).
  - Total profit: \(35 + 0 = 35\). This matches the expected output.

- For the test case `10 10 5`:
  - `a >= b`, so the total profit is \(10 \times 10 = 100\). This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules. It handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
