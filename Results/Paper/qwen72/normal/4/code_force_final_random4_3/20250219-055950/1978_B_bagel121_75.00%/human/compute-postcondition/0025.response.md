Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- If `a` is less than `b`:
  - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
  - `ans` is calculated as the integer value of \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
  - `p2` is calculated as \((n - k) * a\).
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`:
  - `k`, `ans`, and `p2` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans + p2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `k`**:
   - If `a < b`, then `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - If `a >= b`, then `k` remains unchanged (initially undefined).

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - If `a < b`, then `ans` is calculated as the integer value of \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
   - If `a >= b`, then `ans` remains unchanged (initially undefined).

3. **Calculate `p2`**:
   - If `a < b`, then `p2` is calculated as \((n - k) * a\).
   - If `a >= b`, then `p2` remains unchanged (initially undefined).

4. **Sum `ans` and `p2`**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1: `a < b`**:
  - `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`
  - `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`
  - `p2 = (n - k) * a`
  - The output will be `ans + p2`.

- **Case 2: `a >= b`**:
  - `k`, `ans`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
  - Since they are initially undefined, we assume they are 0 (or some default value that doesn't affect the sum).
  - The output will be `0 + 0 = 0`.

### Final Output:
- If `a < b`, the output will be the sum of `ans` and `p2` as calculated above.
- If `a >= b`, the output will be `0`.

Output: **ans + p2 (where ans and p2 are calculated as described if a < b, otherwise 0)**
