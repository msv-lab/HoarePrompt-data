Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the values of `k`, `ans`, and `p2` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` based on user input, converting them to integers.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is incremented by 1, which remain unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now input integers.
- The conditions for `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are still valid and depend on the values of `a` and `b` as described in the initial state.
