Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
3. `a` is less than `b`.
4. `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
5. `ans` is the integer result of \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
6. `p2` is \((n - k) * a\).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`**:
   - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - This means `k` will be the smaller of the two values: the number of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive, or `n`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the integer result of \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the first `k` integers starting from `b - k + 1` to `b`.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula \(\text{sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)\), where `n` is the number of terms, `a` is the first term, and `l` is the last term.
   - Here, the first term is `b - k + 1` and the last term is `b`, and the number of terms is `k`.
   - Therefore, `ans` is the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b`.

3. **Calculate `p2`**:
   - `p2` is \((n - k) * a\).
   - This formula calculates the product of the remaining number of terms (`n - k`) and the integer `a`.

4. **Calculate `ans + p2`**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

### Final Output:
- `ans` is the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b`.
- `p2` is the product of the remaining number of terms (`n - k`) and `a`.
- The final output will be the sum of these two values.

Output: **(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of b - a + 1 and n)**
