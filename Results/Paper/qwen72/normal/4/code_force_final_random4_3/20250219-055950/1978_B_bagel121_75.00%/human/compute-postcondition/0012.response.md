Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `_` is incremented by 1, if `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` to new input integers. The initial state conditions for `t` being greater than 0, `_` being incremented by 1, and the conditions for `k`, `ans`, and `p2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the integers provided by the user input.
