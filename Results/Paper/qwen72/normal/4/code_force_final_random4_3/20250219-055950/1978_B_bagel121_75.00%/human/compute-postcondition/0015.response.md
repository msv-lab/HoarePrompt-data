Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `_` is incremented by 1, if `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the integer result of the expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `k`, and `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `if a is less than b` still holds, and `k` is still the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `p2` is still `(n - k) * a`.
- The value of `_` is still incremented by 1.
- `t` is still greater than 0.
