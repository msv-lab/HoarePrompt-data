Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `_` is incremented by 1, if `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p2 = (n - k) * a` updates the value of `p2` based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`. The value of `p2` is now `(n - k) * a`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
