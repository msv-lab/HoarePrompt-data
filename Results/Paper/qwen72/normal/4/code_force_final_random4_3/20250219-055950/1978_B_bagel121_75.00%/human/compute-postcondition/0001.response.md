The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts since it is a throwaway variable used for iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
