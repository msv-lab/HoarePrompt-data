Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. It reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, it calculates and prints a result. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the result is `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, then computes `ans` as the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k` and `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, and prints `ans + p2`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
