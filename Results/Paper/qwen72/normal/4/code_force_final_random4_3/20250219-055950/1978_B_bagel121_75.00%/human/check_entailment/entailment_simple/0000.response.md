### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If this condition is true, it means that the usual price of a bun is at least as high as the modified price, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit. This is correctly handled by the line `print(n * a)`.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation**:
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This is because selling more than `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price would result in a price lower than `a`, which is not beneficial.
   - The formula `k = min(b - a + 1, n)` correctly determines the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a price higher than `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula correctly computes the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then printed as `ans + p2`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) and when `a` is equal to `b` or when `a` is much smaller than `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. The conditions and calculations are accurate and handle all given constraints and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
