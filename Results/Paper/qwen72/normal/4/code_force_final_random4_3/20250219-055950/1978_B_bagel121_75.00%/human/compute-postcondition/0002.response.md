The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.**
