Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` from the previous iteration as a key, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is greater than 1. The value of `num` in `frequency_table` is incremented by 1.**
