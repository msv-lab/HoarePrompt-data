Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` and the third element of `arr` (i.e., `num`) as keys, `num` is the third element of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is greater than 2. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, the value associated with the key `num` in `frequency_table` is now `k`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `num` in `frequency_table` is incremented by 1.***
