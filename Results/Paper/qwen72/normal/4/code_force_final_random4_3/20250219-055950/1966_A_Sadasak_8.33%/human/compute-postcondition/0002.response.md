Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is 1, `num` is the first element of `arr`**

Explanation:
- `frequency_table[num]` is updated to `frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1`. Since `frequency_table` was initially empty, `frequency_table.get(num, 0)` returns 0, so `frequency_table[num]` is set to 1.
- The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `num` is still the first element of `arr`.
