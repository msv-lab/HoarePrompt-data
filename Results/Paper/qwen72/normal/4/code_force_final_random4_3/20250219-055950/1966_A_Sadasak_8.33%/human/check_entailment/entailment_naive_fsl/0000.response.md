Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem for all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
For the input `4 2` with the card numbers `1 1 1 1`, the optimal solution is to perform the operation twice:
1. Choose the first 2 cards (both with number 1) and exchange them for 1 card with any number.
2. Choose the next 2 cards (both with number 1) and exchange them for 1 card with any number.

After these operations, you are left with 2 cards. However, the program incorrectly outputs 4, which is the initial number of cards.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function and the main loop. The program does not correctly account for the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the number of cards with the same number is a multiple of `k` and can be reduced further.
