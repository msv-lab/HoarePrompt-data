### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then converts the first element of the list to an integer `n` and the rest to a list of integers `a`.
   - This approach is incorrect because it assumes that the input is a single line of space-separated integers, which is not the case. The input is structured with multiple test cases, each having its own `n` and `a`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` is defined to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is unnecessary.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.

3. **Container Balance Check:**
   - The function iterates through the list `a` and maintains a cumulative balance `container`.
   - For each container, it updates the balance by adding the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the balance becomes negative, it returns 'No'. This is because a negative balance indicates that more water has been poured out than has been poured in, which is not possible with the given operation constraints (i.e., pouring from a container with a higher index to a lower index).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n, a)` for the first test case only, which is incorrect because it should handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The program fails to handle multiple test cases correctly. It reads all input at once and processes only the first test case.
- The function `func_1` is logically correct for a single test case, but the input parsing and handling of multiple test cases are incorrect.
- To fix this, the program should read each test case separately and call `func_1` for each test case, printing the result for each one.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case separately, ensuring that the input is correctly parsed and the function `func_1` is called for each test case.
