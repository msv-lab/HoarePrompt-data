Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`, `a` must have at least 1 element, `water` is the first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `container += water - target` updates the value of `container` by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to its current value. Initially, `container` is 0, so after the execution, `container` will be equal to `water - target`. All other initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
