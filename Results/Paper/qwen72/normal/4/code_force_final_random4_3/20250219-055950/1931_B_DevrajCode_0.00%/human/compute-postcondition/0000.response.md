Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`.** 

The value of `total_water` is now the sum of all integers in the list `a`. The initial conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
