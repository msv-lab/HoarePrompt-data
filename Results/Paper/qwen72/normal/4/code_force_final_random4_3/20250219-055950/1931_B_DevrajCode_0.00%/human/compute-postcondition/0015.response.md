The only objects in the loop head are the variable `water` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `water` was the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `water` will be the third element of `a`, and `a` must have at least 3 elements.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `2 * (water - target)`, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `water` is the third element of `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, `container` is greater than or equal to 0.**
