The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the integers in `a` such that each element in `a` equals the average of the sum of `a` divided by `n`. If at any point during the redistribution process the cumulative difference between the current element and the target average becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. If the redistribution is possible without any negative cumulative differences, the function returns 'Yes'.
