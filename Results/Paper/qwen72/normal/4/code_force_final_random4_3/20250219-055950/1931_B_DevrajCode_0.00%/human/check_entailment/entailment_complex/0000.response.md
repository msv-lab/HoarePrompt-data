### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then extracts the number of test cases `n` from the first element and the list of water amounts `a` from the rest of the elements. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases properly. The input should be processed in a loop to handle each test case separately.

2. **Sum and Divisibility Check**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water in the containers and checks if it is divisible by `n`. This check is redundant because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Target Calculation**:
   - The target amount of water for each container is calculated as `total_water // n`. This is correct.

4. **Redistribution Check**:
   - The function iterates through the list `a` and maintains a cumulative difference `container`. For each element, it updates `container` by adding the difference between the current element and the target.
   - If `container` becomes negative at any point, the function returns 'No'. This is correct because if `container` becomes negative, it means that the amount of water in the containers up to that point is less than the target, and it is impossible to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more water to achieve the target.

5. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'. This is correct because it means that the redistribution is possible.

### Issues:
- **Input Handling**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should read the number of test cases and then process each test case in a loop.
- **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `a` as arguments, but `n` is the number of test cases, not the number of containers. This is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with input handling and the function call, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
