### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Clique Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of cliques needed using `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable approach because it ensures that the vertices are divided into the minimum number of segments (cliques) of length `k` or less.

3. **Array Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n` with zeros. `arr` will store the integers assigned to the vertices, and `cliquess` will store the clique assignments for each vertex.

4. **Filling the Arrays:**
   - The program iterates over the number of cliques and calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - The `make_array` function is responsible for assigning integers to the vertices and determining their clique assignments.
   - The function `make_array` divides the segment `[left, right]` into two parts: the first half is filled with increasing integers starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing integers starting from `right + 1`.

5. **Clique Assignment:**
   - The `cliquess` array is filled with the same `clique` value for all vertices in the current segment, ensuring that all vertices in the same segment belong to the same clique.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.
   - However, there is a mistake in the output: the `cliquess` array is printed as all zeros, which is incorrect. The `cliquess` array should contain the clique assignments for each vertex, which are set within the `make_array` function.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the number of cliques and assigns integers to the vertices.
- The `make_array` function correctly fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
- However, the final output of the `cliquess` array is incorrect because it prints all zeros instead of the actual clique assignments.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct but fails to print the `cliquess` array correctly, which should contain the clique assignments for each vertex. This is a critical error because the problem requires the output of the clique assignments.
