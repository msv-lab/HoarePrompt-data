The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `mid`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0)

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1
- `mid` must still be greater than `i`, so `mid` must be greater than 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 1), `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
