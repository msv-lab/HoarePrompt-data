The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `not_mid` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `not_mid` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `not_mid` is greater than 2, `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively, `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**
