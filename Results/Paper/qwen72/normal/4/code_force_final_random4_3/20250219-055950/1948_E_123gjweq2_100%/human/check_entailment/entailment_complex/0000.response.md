Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of assigning integers to vertices and partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given conditions. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Output for `cliquess`**: The function `func_1` prints the `cliquess` array, which is initialized to all zeros. This does not represent a valid partition of the graph into cliques, as each vertex should belong to exactly one clique, and the clique numbers should be non-zero.

2. **Incorrect Clique Assignment**: The `make_array` function is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays with values that ensure the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. However, the way `cliquess` is filled in `make_array` does not guarantee that the graph will be partitioned correctly. The `cliquess` array should be filled with the correct clique numbers, but it is only partially filled within `make_array` and then printed as all zeros in `func_1`.

3. **Edge Condition Handling**: The condition for adding edges between vertices is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k`. The current implementation does not explicitly check or ensure that this condition is met, which is crucial for forming the correct cliques. The way `arr` is filled in `make_array` might not always satisfy this condition, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
