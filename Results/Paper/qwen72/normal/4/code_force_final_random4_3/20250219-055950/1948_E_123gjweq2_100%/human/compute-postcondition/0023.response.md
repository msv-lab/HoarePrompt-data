Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `not_mid - 1`, `not_mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively, `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `cliquess[left + mid]` are all set to `clique`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` to `arr[left + mid]` are filled with `big_element - i` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` respectively.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `not_mid - 1`.
- The variable `not_mid` is the number of iterations that the loop executed, and it is greater than or equal to 0.
- The variables `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers with `left` less than `right`.
- The variable `clique` remains a positive integer.
- The variable `small_element` is still `left + 1`.
- The variable `big_element` is still `right + 1`.
- The variable `mid` is still `(right - left) // 2`.
- The elements in the array `arr` from index `left + mid - i - 1` to `left` are filled with values from `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively.
- The elements in the array `cliquess` from index `left + i` to `left` are all set to `clique`.
- The elements in the array `cliquess` from index `left + mid + i` to `left + mid` are all set to `clique`.
- The elements in the array `arr` from index `left + mid + i` to `left + mid` are filled with values from `big_element - i` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` respectively.
