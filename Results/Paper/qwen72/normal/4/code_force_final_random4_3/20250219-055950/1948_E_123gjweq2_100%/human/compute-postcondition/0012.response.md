Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 2), `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 4`, `cliquess[left + 2]` is `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cliquess[left + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + 2]` to `clique`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
