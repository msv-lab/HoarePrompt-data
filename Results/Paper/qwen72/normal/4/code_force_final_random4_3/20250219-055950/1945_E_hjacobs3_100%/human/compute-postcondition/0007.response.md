Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `array[mid]` is greater than `find`.**

The value of `r` is updated to `mid`, which is `n // 2`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
