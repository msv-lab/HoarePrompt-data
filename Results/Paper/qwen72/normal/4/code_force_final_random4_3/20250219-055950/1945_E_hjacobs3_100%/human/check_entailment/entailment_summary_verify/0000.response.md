### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `l` and `r` as `(0, n)`, which is different from the problem description that specifies `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results because the binary search algorithm in the problem description is designed to work with 1-based indexing.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is not entirely correct. The condition `if array[mid] <= find:` should be `if array[mid - 1] <= find:` to match the 1-based indexing. Additionally, the loop should end when `r - l == 1`, but the function uses `r - l > 1`, which is correct.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` only performs one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`. However, the problem description allows for up to two swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The current implementation does not account for the possibility of needing a second swap.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not the correct approach. The number of swaps should be returned as part of the output, and the swaps themselves should be returned as a list of strings.

### Case where the program fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

### Actual Output:
```
1
2 4
```

### Explanation of the failure:
1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `l` and `r` as `(0, 6)`, which is incorrect. It should be `(1, 7)` to match the 1-based indexing.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The function uses `array[mid]` instead of `array[mid - 1]` in the binary search condition, which is incorrect for 1-based indexing.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function only performs one swap, which is insufficient. In this case, the permutation needs to be rearranged to ensure that the binary search can find the correct position of `3`. The correct swaps would be `4` with `5` and `2` with `4`.

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, we need to:
1. Adjust the binary search initialization to use 1-based indexing.
2. Correct the binary search condition to use 1-based indexing.
3. Implement the logic to perform up to two swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
4. Return the number of swaps and the swaps themselves in the correct format.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(res[0])
    for swap in res[1]:
        print(' '.join(swap))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    swaps = []
    
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if array[l - 1] == find:
        return [0, []]
    
    # Find the correct position for find
    correct_pos = array.index(find) + 1
    
    # Perform the first swap
    if l != correct_pos:
        swaps.append([str(l), str(correct_pos)])
        array[l - 1], array[correct_pos - 1] = array[correct_pos - 1], array[l - 1]
    
    # Perform the second swap if needed
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if array[l - 1] == find:
        return [len(swaps), swaps]
    
    # If the second swap is needed
    if l != correct_pos:
        swaps.append([str(l), str(correct_pos)])
        array[l - 1], array[correct_pos - 1] = array[correct_pos - 1], array[l - 1]
    
    return [len(swaps), swaps]
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly handle the binary search and the swapping logic as described in the problem statement. The corrected program addresses these issues and should now work correctly.

Final: **False**
