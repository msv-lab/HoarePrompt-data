Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `r - l` must be greater than 1, `r` is now equal to `mid`.**

The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
