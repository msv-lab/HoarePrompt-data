Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of rearranging a permutation so that a binary search can correctly find a specified element `x`. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` has a few issues that affect its correctness:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is not correctly implemented. The indices `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n`, respectively, which is correct. However, the condition for the loop is `while r - l > 1`, which means the loop will terminate when `r - l == 1`. This is not the standard termination condition for binary search, which should typically be `while l < r`.

2. **Indexing Issue**: The function uses 0-based indexing for the array, but the problem description and the output format require 1-based indexing. The function returns `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` to convert to 1-based indexing, which is correct, but the logic for determining `l` and `r` should also consider this.

3. **Output of Operations**: The function is supposed to output the number of operations and the indices of the swaps, but it only prints the number of operations (`1` or `0`) and returns the indices. This is incorrect because the number of operations should be printed outside the function, and the function should return the indices directly without printing.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case, but it does not handle the output correctly for multiple test cases. The number of operations should be printed for each test case, followed by the indices of the swaps if any.

5. **Binary Search Result**: The function checks if `l` (the index found by the binary search) is equal to the index of `find` in the array. This is not the correct condition to check. Instead, it should check if `array[l]` is equal to `find`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The binary search logic is flawed, and the output format is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
