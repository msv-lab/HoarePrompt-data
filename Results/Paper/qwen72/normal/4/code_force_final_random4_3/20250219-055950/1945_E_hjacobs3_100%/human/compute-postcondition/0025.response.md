The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `find` is an integer such that `1 <= find <= n`. The function returns a list containing two string values: the first value is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and the second value is the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the index (1-based) of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of `find` in `array`.**
