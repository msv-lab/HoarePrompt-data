Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the permutation `array` and the target `find`.
   - The function initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively, which are the bounds for the binary search.
   - The binary search loop continues until `r - l` is 1, which means the search has narrowed down to a single element.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap to correct the position of `find`.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints 0 and returns an empty list, indicating no swaps are needed.

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies the need to swap elements to ensure that `array[l]` is equal to `find` after the binary search.
   - The swap is performed by returning the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` as strings.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the permutation is already in a form that allows the binary search to find `find` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where a single swap is needed to correct the permutation.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that it performs at most 2 swaps, as required by the problem statement.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and adheres to the input and output formats specified.

7. **Potential Issues**:
   - The binary search logic is correct, but the program assumes that the permutation can always be corrected with at most one swap. This assumption is not always valid, especially for larger permutations where more than one swap might be necessary to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The program does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed, which is a requirement of the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not fully correct because it does not account for the possibility of needing more than one swap to correct the permutation. The problem statement explicitly allows for up to 2 swaps, and the program only handles up to 1 swap.

Correctness: **False**
