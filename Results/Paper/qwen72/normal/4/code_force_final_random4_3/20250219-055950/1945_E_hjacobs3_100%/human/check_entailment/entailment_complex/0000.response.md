Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is correct for a sorted array. However, the problem states that the array is a permutation and not necessarily sorted. The binary search is used to find the position `l` where `array[l]` is the largest element less than or equal to `find` and `array[r]` is the smallest element greater than `find`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function checks if the index `l` (where `array[l]` is the largest element less than or equal to `find`) is not equal to the actual index of `find` in the array. If they are not equal, it prints `1` and returns a list of two indices (1-based) to swap to correct the position of `find`. If they are equal, it prints `0` and does nothing, indicating no swaps are needed.

3. **Output Format**: The function prints the number of swaps required and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped in the correct format (1-based indices).

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The outer loop correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case one by one.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function should work for edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, as well as for larger permutations. The binary search and swapping logic should handle these cases correctly.

However, there is a critical issue with the function:

- **Binary Search Initialization**: The binary search initializes `l` and `r` as `0` and `n` respectively. This is incorrect because the problem description states that the binary search should start with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results, especially when `n` is small.

- **Indexing Issue**: The function uses 0-based indexing for the array, but the problem requires 1-based indexing for the output. The function correctly converts the indices to 1-based when printing, but the binary search logic itself should use 1-based indexing to match the problem description.

Given these issues, the function is not correct as it does not follow the exact binary search initialization and indexing as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
