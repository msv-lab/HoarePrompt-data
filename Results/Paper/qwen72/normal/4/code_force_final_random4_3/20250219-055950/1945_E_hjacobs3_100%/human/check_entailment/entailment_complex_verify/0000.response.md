### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The problem description specifies that the initial values for `l` and `r` should be `1` and `n + 1`, respectively. However, in the provided code, `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n`, respectively. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results because the binary search loop condition and the midpoint calculation are based on these initial values.
   - The correct initialization should be:
     ```python
     l, r = 1, n + 1
     ```

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `while r - l > 1` is correct for the given initialization of `l` and `r` as `1` and `n + 1`.
   - The midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is also correct.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program only performs one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`. This is insufficient because the problem allows for up to two swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The provided code does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed. For example, in the test case:
     ```
     6 3
     4 3 1 5 2 6
     ```
     The binary search will not find `3` at the correct position with only one swap. The correct output should be:
     ```
     2
     4 5
     2 4
     ```

4. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not the correct approach. The number of swaps should be printed outside the function, and the function should return the swap operations as a list.

### Corrected Code:
To address the issues, the code should be modified as follows:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(len(res))
    for swap in res:
        print(' '.join(swap))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 1, n + 1
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Find the index of `find` in the array
    find_index = array.index(find) + 1
    
    # If `l` is already the correct index, no swaps are needed
    if l == find_index:
        return []
    
    # Perform the first swap
    array[l - 1], array[find_index - 1] = array[find_index - 1], array[l - 1]
    
    # Check if the binary search now works correctly
    l, r = 1, n + 1
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if l == find_index:
        return [[str(l), str(find_index)]]
    
    # Perform the second swap if needed
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if array[i - 1] > find and i < l:
            array[l - 1], array[i - 1] = array[i - 1], array[l - 1]
            break
    
    l, r = 1, n + 1
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if l == find_index:
        return [[str(l), str(find_index)], [str(l), str(i)]]
    
    # If after two swaps, the binary search still doesn't work, return an error
    return ["Error: Binary search failed after two swaps"]
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Initialization**: `l` and `r` are initialized to `1` and `n + 1` to match the problem description.
- **First Swap**: If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, perform a swap to move `find` to the position `l`.
- **Second Swap**: If the binary search still doesn't work correctly, perform a second swap to ensure the binary search works. This involves finding an element greater than `find` that is before `l` and swapping it with the element at position `l`.
- **Output**: The number of swaps is printed outside the function, and the function returns the swap operations as a list of lists.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **accurate**. The provided program does not correctly handle the binary search and the swapping logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
