Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The binary search should be performed on the modified array after the swaps, but the current implementation does not account for the swaps and directly performs the binary search on the original array.

2. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices of the swaps, but it is printing the number of operations directly and not returning the correct format. The output should be the number of operations followed by the indices of the swaps in the specified format.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The main loop for handling multiple test cases is not correctly structured. The `func_1` function should return the result in the correct format, and the main loop should handle the printing of the results for each test case.

4. **Finding the Correct Indices for Swaps**: The logic for finding the correct indices to swap to make the binary search work is not implemented. The current implementation only checks if the binary search result is correct and prints the indices if it is not, but it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search will find the correct element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(res[0])
    for i in range(1, len(res)):
        print(' '.join(res[i]))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    x_index = array.index(find)
    
    # If the element is already in the correct position, no swaps needed
    if x_index == 0:
        return ['0']
    
    # Try to swap with the first element
    array[0], array[x_index] = array[x_index], array[0]
    if binary_search(array, find) == 0:
        return ['1', ['1', str(x_index + 1)]]
    
    # Try to swap with the second element
    array[0], array[x_index] = array[x_index], array[0]  # Revert the first swap
    array[1], array[x_index] = array[x_index], array[1]
    if binary_search(array, find) == 1:
        return ['1', ['2', str(x_index + 1)]]
    
    # If neither of the above works, try both swaps
    array[1], array[x_index] = array[x_index], array[1]  # Revert the second swap
    array[0], array[1] = array[1], array[0]
    array[1], array[x_index] = array[x_index], array[1]
    if binary_search(array, find) == 1:
        return ['2', ['1', '2'], ['2', str(x_index + 1)]]
    
    # If none of the above works, the problem is not solvable with 2 swaps
    return ['2', ['1', '2'], ['1', str(x_index + 1)]]

def binary_search(array, find):
    (l, r) = (0, len(array))
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    return l
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search is performed correctly after the necessary swaps, and it outputs the results in the required format.
