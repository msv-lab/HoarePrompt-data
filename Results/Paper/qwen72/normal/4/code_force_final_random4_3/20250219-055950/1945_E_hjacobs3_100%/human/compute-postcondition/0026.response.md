Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `array` of integers representing a permutation of size `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and an integer `find` (where 1 <= find <= n). It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of `find` in `array`. If `l` (the largest index such that `array[l]` <= `find`) is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not modify the input `array`. **
