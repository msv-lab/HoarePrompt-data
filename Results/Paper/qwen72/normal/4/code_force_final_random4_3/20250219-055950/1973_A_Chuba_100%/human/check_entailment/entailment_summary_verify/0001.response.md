### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Checking for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must always be even (each game contributes 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total number of points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This term accounts for the scenario where `v[2]` is so high that it cannot be achieved with the given scores of `v[0]` and `v[1]` without invalidating the draw condition.
     - The formula then subtracts the excess points that cannot be explained by draws and divides by 2 to get the number of draws.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

### Validation with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: No games were played, so no draws could occur.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `0 1 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Reason: One game occurred between the second and third players, and it ended in a draw.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: It's impossible to achieve these scores with any valid set of games.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The scores can be achieved with two draws (1-1, 1-1) and one win/loss (0-2).

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `3 3 3`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: It's impossible to achieve these scores with any valid set of games.

- **Example 6:**
  - Input: `3 4 5`
  - Output: `6`
  - Reason: The scores can be achieved with six draws (1-1, 1-1, 1-1, 1-1, 1-1, 1-1) and one win/loss (0-2).

- **Example 7:**
  - Input: `1 1 10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The scores can be achieved with two draws (1-1, 1-1) and several win/loss games to make up the difference.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The logic for checking the validity of the scores is correct.
- The formula for calculating the maximum number of draws is derived correctly and handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final: **True**
