Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Score Validity Check**: The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must always be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw). In such a case, the program prints `-1`.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
   \]
   This formula works as follows:
   - The total points scored by all players is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])`.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is non-negative. This is necessary because if `v[2]` is significantly higher than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means that the highest score is not achievable with the given scores.
   - Subtracting this term from the total points gives the number of points that could be distributed as draws.
   - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly and follows the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
