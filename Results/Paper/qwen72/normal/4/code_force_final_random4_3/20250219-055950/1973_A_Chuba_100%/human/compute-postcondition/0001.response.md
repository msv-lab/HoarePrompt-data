The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it starts from 0 by default when the loop begins.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, this ensures that `t` is greater than 0, which means the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` does not need to be explicitly adjusted since it is handled by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is 0**
