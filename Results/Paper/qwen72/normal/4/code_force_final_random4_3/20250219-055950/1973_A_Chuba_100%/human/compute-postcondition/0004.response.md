The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'-1'`. The initial state describes the variables and conditions before the code is executed, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints a constant string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **-1**
