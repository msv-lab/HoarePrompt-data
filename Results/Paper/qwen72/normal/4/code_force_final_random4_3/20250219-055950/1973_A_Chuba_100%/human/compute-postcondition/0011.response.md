The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs a constant string `'-1'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `_`, and `v`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **-1**
