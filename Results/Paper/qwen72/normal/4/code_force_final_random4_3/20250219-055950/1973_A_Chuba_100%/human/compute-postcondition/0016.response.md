Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of integers provided by the user, `result` is not yet set.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `v` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. Since the code snippet provided does not set the value of `result`, it remains undefined in the output state.
