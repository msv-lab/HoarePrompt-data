### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Checking for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must always be even (each game contributes 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total number of points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` does not exceed the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This is because if `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means that `v[2]` must have won all the games against the other two players, which is not possible if there are draws.
     - The formula then subtracts the excess points that cannot be explained by draws and divides by 2 to get the number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1: All scores are zero (0 0 0)**
     - Sum is 0, which is even.
     - `max(0, 0 - 0 - 0) = 0`
     - Result: `(0 - 0) // 2 = 0`
     - Correct output: 0
   - **Case 2: One draw (0 1 1)**
     - Sum is 2, which is even.
     - `max(0, 1 - 0 - 1) = 0`
     - Result: `(2 - 0) // 2 = 1`
     - Correct output: 1
   - **Case 3: Invalid scores (1 1 1)**
     - Sum is 3, which is odd.
     - Correct output: -1
   - **Case 4: Two draws (1 1 2)**
     - Sum is 4, which is even.
     - `max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = 0`
     - Result: `(4 - 0) // 2 = 2`
     - Correct output: 2
   - **Case 5: Invalid scores (3 3 3)**
     - Sum is 9, which is odd.
     - Correct output: -1
   - **Case 6: Six draws (3 4 5)**
     - Sum is 12, which is even.
     - `max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = 0`
     - Result: `(12 - 0) // 2 = 6`
     - Correct output: 6
   - **Case 7: Two draws (1 1 10)**
     - Sum is 12, which is even.
     - `max(0, 10 - 1 - 1) = 8`
     - Result: `(12 - 8) // 2 = 2`
     - Correct output: 2

5. **General Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic for checking the validity of the scores is correct.
   - The formula for calculating the maximum number of draws is derived correctly and handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify invalid scores.

Final: **True**
