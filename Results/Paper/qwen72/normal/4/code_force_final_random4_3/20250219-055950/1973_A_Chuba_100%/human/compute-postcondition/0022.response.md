The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including an integer `t` and three other integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. The constraints are that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

However, if we assume the function is designed to process these parameters and return some result, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) and three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30). The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
