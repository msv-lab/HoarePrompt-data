The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `removals`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables change and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

1. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Since this is a `for` loop, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
2. **Variable `removals`**: The loop condition is `i in range(1, removals + 1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `removals + 1`. Since `i` is now 3, `removals` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `s` is reduced by the value of the second-to-last element in `elements`, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if the indices `-(negatives + 1)` and `-1` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0, `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * n`. If the indices `-(negatives + 2)` and `-2` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]`. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0, and `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * 0`.**
