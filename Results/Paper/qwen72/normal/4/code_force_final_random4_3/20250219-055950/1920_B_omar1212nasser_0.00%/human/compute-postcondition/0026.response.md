Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains the values of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration, including the final value. Here, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, and `n` is 0 if `negatives + removals` exceeds the length of `elements`, otherwise it is the sum of the elements from `-(negatives + removals)` to `-(removals + 1)`.**
