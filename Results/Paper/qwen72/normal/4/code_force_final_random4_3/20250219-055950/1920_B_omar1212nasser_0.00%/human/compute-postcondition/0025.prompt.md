Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), and `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(`elements`) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `elements`[i] <= 1000. Additionally, it is not the case that (`removals` == 6 and `negatives` == 3). `pos` is a list containing one element which is the value of `s - 2 * n`. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`. `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    try:
        n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
    except IndexError:
        n = 0
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is reduced by the value of the last element in `elements`, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if the indices `-(negatives + 1)` and `-1` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0, `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is reduced by the value of the second-to-last element in `elements`, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if the indices `-(negatives + 1)` and `-1` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0, `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * n`. If the indices `-(negatives + 2)` and `-2` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]`. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0, and `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `removals` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `s` is reduced by the value of the second-to-last element in `elements` and by the value of the element at index `-i` in the `elements` list, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices `-(negatives + i)` and `-i` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0, and `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
