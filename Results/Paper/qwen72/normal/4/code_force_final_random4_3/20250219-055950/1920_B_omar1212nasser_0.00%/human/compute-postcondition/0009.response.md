Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is reduced by the value of the last element in `elements`, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]`**. 

This means that the value of `n` is now the original value of `n` plus the value of the element at the index `-(negatives + 1)` in the `elements` list, minus the value of the last element in the `elements` list. The other variables (`removals`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
