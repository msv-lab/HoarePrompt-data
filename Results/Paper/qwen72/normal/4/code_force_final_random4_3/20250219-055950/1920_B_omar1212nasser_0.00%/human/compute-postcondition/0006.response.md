Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), and `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(`elements`) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `elements`[i] <= 1000. Additionally, it is not the case that (`removals` == 6 and `negatives` == 3). `pos` is a list containing one element which is the value of `s - 2 * n`. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`. `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Since `pos` was initially an empty list, after the execution, `pos` contains one element which is the result of `s - 2 * n`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
