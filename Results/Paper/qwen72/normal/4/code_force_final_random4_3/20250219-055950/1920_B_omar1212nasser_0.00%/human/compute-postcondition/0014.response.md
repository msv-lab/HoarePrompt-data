Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is reduced by the value of the second-to-last element in `elements`, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if the indices `-(negatives + 1)` and `-1` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0, `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * n`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is reduced by the value of the second-to-last element in the `elements` list, as `i` is 2.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `removals` is still greater than 0.
- The value of `n` is updated based on the condition provided: `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if the indices `-(negatives + 1)` and `-1` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0.
- The list `pos` now includes the value `s - 2 * n`.
