An `IndexError` might be triggered at `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the index `-(negatives + i)` or `-i` is out of the bounds of the `elements` list. This can happen if `negatives + i` or `i` is greater than the length of the `elements` list.

The `try` block attempts to update `n` by adding the difference between the elements at the indices `-(negatives + i)` and `-i`. If an `IndexError` occurs, the `except` block sets `n` to 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is reduced by the value of the last element in `elements`. If the indices `-(negatives + i)` and `-i` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]`. Otherwise, `n` is set to 0.
