### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes three variables:
     - `i` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the string `a`.
     - `j` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the string `b`.
     - `c` to 0, which will count the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Finding the Subsequence:**
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings `a` and `b` as long as `j` is less than `m` and `i` is less than `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1` to find the index of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), it updates `j` to `new_j + 1`, increments `i` by 1, and increments `c` by 1.
   - If `func_1` returns -1, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the current character `a[i]` is not found in the remaining part of `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: the strings `a` and `b`, and the indices `i` and `j`.
   - It uses the `find` method to locate the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the character in the original string `b` (i.e., `j + index`).
   - If the character is not found, it returns -1.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for finding the subsequence is sound. It iterates through both strings and uses the `find` method to locate the required characters, ensuring that the prefix of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.
- The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`, which is a valid approach for this problem.
- The program handles the case where the character is not found by breaking out of the loop and printing the correct count `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
