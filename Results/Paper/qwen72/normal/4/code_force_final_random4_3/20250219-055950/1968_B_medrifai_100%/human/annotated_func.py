#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings (strings consisting of the characters '0' and '1'), i and j are non-negative integers representing the lengths of a and b respectively, such that 1 <= i, j <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the sum of `j` and `index`, where `j` is the length of the binary string `b`, and `index` is the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` if `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, it returns -1.
