### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes three variables: `i` (index for string `a`), `j` (index for string `b`), and `c` (counter for the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`).

3. **Loop and Function Call:**
   - The program uses a `while` loop to iterate through the strings `a` and `b` until one of the strings is fully traversed.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j`), it updates `j` to `new_j + 1` (to move past the found character in `b`), increments `i` (to move to the next character in `a`), and increments `c` (to count the matched character).
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it breaks the loop, indicating that the current character in `a` cannot be found in the remaining part of `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` using the `find` method.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index relative to the original string `b` by adding `j` to the found index.
   - If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. The function `func_1` is used to find the next matching character in `b` for the current character in `a`, and the loop ensures that the program continues to find matches until it can no longer do so.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
