Postcondition: ***`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `q` now contains at least one element. If `vis[node]` is False, `node` is added to `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `node` is not added to `q` and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.***
