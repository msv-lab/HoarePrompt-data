Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `q` now contains at least one element including `node`, `node` is the next node in `graph[ver]`**

The node `node` has been appended to the queue `q`, so `q` now includes this node along with any other elements it already contained. The other conditions remain unchanged.
