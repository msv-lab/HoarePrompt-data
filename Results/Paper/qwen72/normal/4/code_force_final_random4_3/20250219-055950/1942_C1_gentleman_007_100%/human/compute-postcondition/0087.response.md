Functionality: ** The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `num` (where `num >= 2`) and returns a list of all prime numbers from 0 to `num` inclusive. The function also updates two lists, `Highest_Prime` and `Lowest_Prime`, such that for each index `i` in the range from 2 to `num` inclusive, `Highest_Prime[i]` contains the largest prime factor of `i`, and `Lowest_Prime[i]` contains the smallest prime factor of `i`. After the function concludes, the input `num` remains unchanged, and the lists `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` are of length `num + 1`. The returned list `p` contains all indices `i` from 0 to `num` inclusive for which `prime[i]` is `True`. **
