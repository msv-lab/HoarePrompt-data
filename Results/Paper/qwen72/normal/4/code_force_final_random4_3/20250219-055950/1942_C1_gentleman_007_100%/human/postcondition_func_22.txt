The function `func_23` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) found within `arr`. The function modifies a local list `l` to build the LIS, but the original list `arr` remains unchanged. After the function concludes, the length of the LIS is returned, and the state of `arr` is the same as it was before the function call.
