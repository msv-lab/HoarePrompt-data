Output State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, `a` and `b` remain non-empty lists of integers or strings, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where each element is initialized to 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `len(b) - 1` and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` is now `len(a) - 1`.
- The value of `j` remains `len(b)`.
- The lists `a` and `b` remain non-empty lists of integers or strings.
- The `dp` matrix remains a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and the conditions for setting its elements remain unchanged.
- The conditions for updating the list `l` also remain unchanged.
