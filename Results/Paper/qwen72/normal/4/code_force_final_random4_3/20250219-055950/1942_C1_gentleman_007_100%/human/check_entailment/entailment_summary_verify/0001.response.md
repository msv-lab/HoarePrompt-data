### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bessie has a regular polygon cake with `n` sides.
   - She has already chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The constraint `y = 0` means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the number of sides `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the maximum number of additional vertices `y` (which is always 0).
   - The second line of each test case provides the `x` chosen vertices.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - To form a triangle, we need three vertices.
   - The chosen vertices must be used to form the diagonals.
   - The number of triangles formed by a set of vertices in a polygon can be calculated using combinatorial methods, but in this case, we need to ensure that the triangles are non-intersecting.
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon with `n` sides is `x - 2`.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - The problem can be solved by understanding that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon with `n` sides is `x - 2`.
   - This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and the first two vertices can form a triangle, and each additional vertex can form one more triangle without intersecting the previous ones.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code contains a lot of functions, but none of them directly solve the problem as described.
   - The functions seem to be related to various other problems, such as prime factorization, greatest common divisor, and dynamic programming, which are not relevant to the current problem.
   - The main logic for solving the problem is missing.

6. **Correct Solution**:
   - The correct solution should simply calculate `x - 2` for each test case and print the result.
   - This is because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not solve the problem as described. It contains a lot of irrelevant functions and lacks the main logic to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

**Final: **False**
