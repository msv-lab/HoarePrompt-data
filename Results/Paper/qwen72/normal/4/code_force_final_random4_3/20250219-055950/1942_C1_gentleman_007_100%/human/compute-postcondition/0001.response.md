Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 0 if vertex `i` has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited, `q` is a deque containing the integer `ver`.**

The vertex `ver` has been added to the deque `q`, which was initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
