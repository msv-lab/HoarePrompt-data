To determine what will be printed by the `print(ver, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ver` is the integer that was the second element of the deque `q` at the start of the loop.
   - `q` is a deque that no longer contains the first two integers that were at the front of `q` at the start of the loop but must contain at least one element.
   - `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices.
   - For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` is now `True` and `q` contains these nodes in the order they were processed.
   - Any nodes in `graph[ver]` that were already visited (`vis[node]` was `True`) at the start of the loop remain unadded to `q` and their `vis` values are unchanged.

2. **Understanding the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `ver` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

3. **Determine the Value of `ver`:**
   - `ver` is the integer that was the second element of the deque `q` at the start of the loop. This means that before the loop started, `q` had at least two elements, and `ver` is the second element of that initial deque.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `ver` followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the value of `ver` is explicitly defined as the second element of the deque `q` at the start of the loop. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **[ver] (where [ver] is the second element of the deque `q` at the start of the loop)**
