Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` will have been processed completely. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` will be set to `True`, and these nodes will be appended to `q` in the order they were processed. `q` must contain at least one element. `ver` is now the first element that was removed from `q`.**
