Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `q` now contains at least one element including `node`, `node` is the next node in `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is 1.**

The code sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
