### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If this condition is true, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit. This is because the modified price sequence starts at `b` and decreases, so if `a` is already greater than or equal to `b`, there is no benefit in using the modified price.
   - If `a >= b`, the program prints `n * a`, which is the total profit from selling all buns at the usual price.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the modified price sequence does not go below `a`.
   - The formula `k = min(b - a + 1, n)` is correct because:
     - `b - a + 1` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a price greater than or equal to `a`.
     - `n` is the total number of buns available, and `k` cannot exceed this.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price using the formula `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series:
     - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1` is given by `k * (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2`.
   - The program then calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a` using the formula `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - Finally, it prints the total profit `ans + p2`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a >= b` correctly by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is very large (up to `10^9`) and `b` is very large (up to `10^9`) by using integer division and ensuring the calculations do not overflow.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. The conditions and calculations are accurate and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
