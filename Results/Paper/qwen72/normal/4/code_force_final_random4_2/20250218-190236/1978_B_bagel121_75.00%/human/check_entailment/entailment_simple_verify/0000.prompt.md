You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers for each test case. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `n`. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is the integer value of `(n - k) * a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here’s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Usual Price Condition**: If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price `a` and prints the total profit as `n * a`.

3. **Modified Price Condition**: If the usual price `a` is less than the modified price `b`, the program calculates the optimal value of `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed `n` and that the modified price is used for the maximum number of buns that can still be sold at a higher price than `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then printed as the sum of these two parts.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n = 1`, the program correctly handles the single bun case.
   - When `a = b`, the program sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - When `b` is much larger than `a`, the program correctly calculates the profit by selling as many buns as possible at the modified price.
   - When `n` is much larger than `b - a + 1`, the program correctly limits `k` to `b - a + 1`.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
