The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters it accepts in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t` (the number of test cases), and for each test case, it accepts `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.

The function is expected to process these inputs and return a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. Since the specific output is not provided, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return some result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
