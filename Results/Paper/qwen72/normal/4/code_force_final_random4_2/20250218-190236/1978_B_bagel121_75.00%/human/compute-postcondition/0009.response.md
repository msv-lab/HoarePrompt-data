Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
3. `a` is less than `b`.
4. `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
5. `ans` is the integer value of \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
6. `p2` is the integer value of \((n - k) * a\).

### Code Snippet:
```
print(ans + p2)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`**:
   - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - This means `k` will be the smaller of the two values: `b - a + 1` or `n`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` is given by the formula: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     - \(b - k + 1\) is the value of `b` minus `k` plus 1.
     - So, the expression becomes: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
     - This can be further simplified to: \((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k\).
   - The integer division ensures that the result is an integer.

3. **Calculate `p2`**:
   - `p2` is given by the formula: \((n - k) * a\).
   - This is straightforward: it is the product of the difference between `n` and `k` and the value of `a`.

4. **Sum `ans` and `p2`**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

### Final Output:
- The value of `ans` is \((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k\).
- The value of `p2` is \((n - k) * a\).
- The `print` statement will output the sum of these two values.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the given formulas and conditions, the output will be the sum of the calculated values of `ans` and `p2`.

Output: **(2b - k + 1) / 2 * k + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum value between b - a + 1 and n)**
