Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`, `ans` and `p2` remain unchanged or undefined.**

Explanation:
- `t` is still `t - 1`.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are still input integers.
- `k` is now assigned the value of `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which means `k` will be the smaller of the two values: `b - a + 1` or `n`.
- `ans` and `p2` remain unchanged or undefined, as they are not modified by the code.
