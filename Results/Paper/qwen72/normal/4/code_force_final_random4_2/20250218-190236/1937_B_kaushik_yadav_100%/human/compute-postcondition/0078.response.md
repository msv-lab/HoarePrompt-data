Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of the new `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `b = input().strip()` updates the value of `b` to a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
- The initial state specifies that `b` was already a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, so the new value of `b` is the same as the previous value, but it is now explicitly defined by the user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, `j`, `counter`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
