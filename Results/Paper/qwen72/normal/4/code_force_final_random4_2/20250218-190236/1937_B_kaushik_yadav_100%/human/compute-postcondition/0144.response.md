Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last comparison, `j` is 2, `a` must have at least 3 characters. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
