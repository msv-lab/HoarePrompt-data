Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` also contains the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), and `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`, `i` is 1, `work` is True, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), and `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.***
