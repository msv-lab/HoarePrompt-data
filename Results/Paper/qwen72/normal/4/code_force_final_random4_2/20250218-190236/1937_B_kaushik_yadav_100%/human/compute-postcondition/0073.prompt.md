Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `counter` is 1 or 2, `j` is 0. If the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 and the second character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. If the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', the loop continues. Otherwise, the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `j` is 1. If the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `counter` is 3. Otherwise, if the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', the loop continues and `counter` is 1. If neither of these conditions is met, the loop breaks and `counter` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least 4 characters, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `j` is 2. If the third character of `a` is equal to the third character of `b`, `counter` is 4. If the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
