#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2 × n grid, followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid. The function should return the lexicographically smallest string attainable by any path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell and the number of such paths. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]

    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations. The variable `t` is an integer greater than 0 and has been decremented by the number of iterations completed. The variable `_` is a placeholder and remains unchanged. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `j` is the last index of `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), and `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs and prints the lexicographically smallest string attainable by any path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell of a 2 × n grid, and then prints the number of such paths. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, `j`, and `counter` are no longer in scope.
