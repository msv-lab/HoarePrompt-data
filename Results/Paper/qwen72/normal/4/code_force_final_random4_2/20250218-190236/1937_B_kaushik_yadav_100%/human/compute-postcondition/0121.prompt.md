Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty. If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` remains True. If `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` also contains the first character of `b`, and `i` is 0. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`, `i` is 1. `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), and `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` remains False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes. If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` or `b` followed by the second character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1 == len(a)`, the second character of `b` is appended to `ans` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)`, `i` is incremented to 2. If `work` is False, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` or `b` plus the second character of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes. If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` or `b` followed by the second character of `a` and the character `a[i]`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented to 2 and `work` is False. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented to 2 and `work` remains True. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, the second character of `b` is appended to `ans` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `work` is False, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` or `b` followed by the second character of `a` and the character `b[i]`, `i` is 3, and `work` is False.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
