Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace. If `work` is True, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is False. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include the first character of `b`, `i` remains 0, `work` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1, `work` is True, and `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`. If `work` is False, `ans` is now equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `work` is False, and `ans` is now equal to the first two characters of `b`. If `work` is True, `ans` is equal to the first character of `b` plus the second character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `i` remains 1. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is further appended with the second character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 2. If `work` is False, `i` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 2, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, and `work` is False. If `work` is True, `ans` is equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the third character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `i` remains 2 and `ans` is equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the third character of `a`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the third character of `a` plus the third character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)` but `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is updated to 3 and `ans` remains equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the third character of `a`. If `work` is False, `ans` is equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the character at index 1 of `b`, and `i` is 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
