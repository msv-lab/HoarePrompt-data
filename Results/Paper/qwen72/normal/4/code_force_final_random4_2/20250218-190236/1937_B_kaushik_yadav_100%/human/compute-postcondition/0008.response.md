Output State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True.**

The variable `work` is now set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
