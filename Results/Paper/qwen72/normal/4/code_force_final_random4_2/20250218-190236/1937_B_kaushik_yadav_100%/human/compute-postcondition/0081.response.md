Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.**

The code snippet sets the variable `work` to `True`, which changes its value from the initial state where it could be either `True` or `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
