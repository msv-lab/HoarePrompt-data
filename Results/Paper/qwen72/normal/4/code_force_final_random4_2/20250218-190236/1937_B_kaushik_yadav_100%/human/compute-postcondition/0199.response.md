Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty and have at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is 0, `counter` is 2, `work` is either True or False depending on the loop conditions, and the second character of `a` (i.e., `a[j + 1]`) is equal to the first character of `b` (i.e., `b[j]`).**
