Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain `[False] * n`, `[None] * n`, and `[None] * n` respectively, and `nodes` is now an empty list. `coef0[1]` is now 0, `coef1[1]` is now 1. `c0` and `c1` remain unchanged, and `ok` remains `False`. The `dfs` function has been called with `i` as 1, but without the function definition, we cannot determine the specific changes to the variables.**

The initial state is mostly unchanged, except that the `dfs` function has been called with `i` as 1. The specific changes to the variables `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` within the `dfs` function are unknown without the function definition. However, we know that `coef0[1]` is 0 and `coef1[1]` is 1, and these values remain unchanged after the call to `dfs`.
