#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 1000`. It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing three integers, and stores these integers in lists `x`, `y`, and `r` as the coordinates and radii of `n` disks. The function initializes lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to track the state of each disk, and an empty list `nodes`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each unvisited disk, updating the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists, and populating the `nodes` list with indices of visited disks. After the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the visited disks. If the sum of `coef1` is not zero, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.

If `visited[i]` is `True`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs(i)` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the node at index `i`. It updates the `visited` list to mark nodes as visited and appends the indices of visited nodes to the `nodes` list.
