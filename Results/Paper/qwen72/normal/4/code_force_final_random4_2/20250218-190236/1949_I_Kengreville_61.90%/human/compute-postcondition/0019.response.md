Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`.** 

The code snippet calculates the difference between the integer at index `i` of the list `x` and the integer at index `j` (which is 2) of the same list, and assigns this difference to the variable `dx`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
