Output State: **`nodes` must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in `nodes`, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` three times.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increases the value of `c1` by `coef1[j]` one more time. Since the initial state already stated that `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` twice, after this code snippet, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` three times in total. The values of `nodes` and `j` remain unchanged, and `c0` is still increased by `coef0[j]`.
