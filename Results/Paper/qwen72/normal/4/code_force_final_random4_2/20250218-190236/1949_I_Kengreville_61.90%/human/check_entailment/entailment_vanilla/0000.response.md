### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a set of disks in the plane with integer coordinates and positive integer radii.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - The output should be `YES` if it is possible to change the radii as required, otherwise `NO`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the connected components of the graph formed by the disks.
   - Each disk is represented as a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The program attempts to assign coefficients to each disk such that the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.

4. **Key Steps**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `n` is the number of disks.
     - `x`, `y`, and `r` are arrays to store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
     - `visited` is an array to keep track of visited disks.
     - `coef0` and `coef1` are arrays to store coefficients for each disk.
     - `nodes` is a list to store the nodes in the current connected component.

   - **DFS Function**:
     - The `dfs` function is used to explore the connected component starting from disk `i`.
     - It marks the disk `i` as visited and appends it to the `nodes` list.
     - For each disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the coefficients and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.

   - **Main Function**:
     - The program iterates over all disks and performs a DFS on each unvisited disk.
     - After the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the nodes in the current connected component.
     - If `c1` (the sum of `coef1` values) is non-zero, it means there is a way to change the radii such that the sum of radii decreases, and the program sets `ok` to `True`.
     - Finally, if `ok` is `True`, the program prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the connected components of the graph formed by the disks.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to ensure that the tangency condition is maintained.
   - The condition `c1 != 0` ensures that there is a non-trivial way to change the radii such that the sum of radii decreases.
   - However, the program does not explicitly check for the non-overlapping condition, but this is implicitly handled by the tangency condition and the fact that the radii are positive real numbers.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no disks (i.e., `n = 0`) by not entering the loop.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one disk (i.e., `n = 1`) by correctly setting `ok` to `False` since there is no way to decrease the sum of radii with a single disk.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and should work for the given problem description. It correctly identifies the connected components and checks if the radii can be adjusted to meet the required conditions.

Correctness: **True**
