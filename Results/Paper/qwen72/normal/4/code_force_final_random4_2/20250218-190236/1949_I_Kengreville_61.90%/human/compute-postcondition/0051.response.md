Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, `c0` is `2 * coef0[j]` + `coef0[j]`, `c1` is `coef1[j]` + `coef1[j]` + `coef1[j]`, `ok` is `False`, and `nodes` must contain at least 3 elements. `j` is the third element in `nodes`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c1` is updated by adding `coef1[j]` to its current value.
- The current value of `c1` is `coef1[j]` + `coef1[j]`.
- After the addition, `c1` becomes `coef1[j]` + `coef1[j]` + `coef1[j]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
