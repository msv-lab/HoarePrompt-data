Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `coef0[j]` to be the sum of `r[i]` and `r[j]` minus `coef0[i]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
