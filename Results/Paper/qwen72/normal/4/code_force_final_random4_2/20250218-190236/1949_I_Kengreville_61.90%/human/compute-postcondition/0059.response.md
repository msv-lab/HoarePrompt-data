Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0 and `coef0[2]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1 and `coef1[2]` being 1, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `ok` is `False`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `visited[2]` is `True`.**

Explanation:
- The `dfs(i)` function is called with `i` being 2.
- The `visited` list is updated to mark `visited[2]` as `True`.
- No other variables are directly modified by the `dfs(i)` call, so the initial state remains unchanged for all other variables.
