Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Global Variables**: The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used in both `func_1` and `dfs` without being passed as arguments or defined as global. This can lead to undefined behavior or errors.

2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is called within `func_1` but is not defined to take the necessary parameters. It should be defined to take `i` as an argument and should have access to the necessary variables.

3. **Logic for Tangency and Overlap**: The program checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the squared distances between their centers to the sum of their radii squared. However, it does not ensure that the new radii will maintain tangency or prevent overlap. The logic for updating `coef0` and `coef1` is not clear and does not seem to correctly handle the constraints of the problem.

4. **Sum of Radii Decrease**: The program does not explicitly check if the sum of the radii can be strictly decreased while maintaining the conditions. It only checks if `c1` is non-zero, which is not sufficient to determine if the radii can be adjusted as required.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the disks as nodes in a graph where an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
2. **Check for Bipartite Graph**: Determine if the graph is bipartite. If it is, you can adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and preventing overlap.
3. **DFS or BFS for Bipartite Check**: Use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to color the graph and check for bipartiteness.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    color = [None] * n
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Build the graph
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                graph[i].append(j)
                graph[j].append(i)
    
    # Check if the graph is bipartite
    def dfs(i, c):
        visited[i] = True
        color[i] = c
        for j in graph[i]:
            if not visited[j]:
                if not dfs(j, 1 - c):
                    return False
            elif color[j] == color[i]:
                return False
        return True
    
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            if not dfs(i, 0):
                print('NO')
                return
    
    print('YES')

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs a graph where each node represents a disk, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
2. **Bipartite Check**: The `dfs` function is used to check if the graph is bipartite. If the graph is bipartite, it is possible to adjust the radii as required.
3. **Output**: If the graph is bipartite, the program prints `YES`. Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

This approach ensures that the conditions of the problem are met and provides a correct solution.
