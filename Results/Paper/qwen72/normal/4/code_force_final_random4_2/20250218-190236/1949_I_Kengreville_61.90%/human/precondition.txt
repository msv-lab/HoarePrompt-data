n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. For each disk i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the center coordinates x_i and y_i are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^9, and the radius r_i is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they may be tangent to each other.
