Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s` and must have at least one key, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]`, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, and the current frequency of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`.**
