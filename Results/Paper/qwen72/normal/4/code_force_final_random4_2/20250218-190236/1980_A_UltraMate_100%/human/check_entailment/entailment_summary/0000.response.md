Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of new problems Vlad needs to create to hold `m` rounds, given that he already has a bank of `n` problems with specific difficulty levels.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and a string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Existing Problems:**
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', it checks if the difficulty level is missing from the bank (`hmp`). If it is missing, it adds `m` to the answer `ans` because Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level.
   - If a difficulty level is present but fewer than `m` times, it adds the difference `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans` to account for the additional problems needed.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `ans` for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}`
  - Missing difficulties: 'A', 'F', 'G' (but 'G' is already present, so only 'A' and 'F' are missing)
  - Additional problems needed: 2 (one 'A' and one 'F')
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}`
  - Missing difficulties: 'A', 'F', 'G' (but 'G' is already present, so only 'A' and 'F' are missing)
  - Additional problems needed: 2 for 'A', 2 for 'F', and 1 for 'G' (since 'G' is only present once)
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1`, `BBCDEFFGG`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
  - Missing difficulties: 'A'
  - Additional problems needed: 1 (one 'A')
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of new problems needed for each test case. It handles the input and output as expected and calculates the result accurately based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
