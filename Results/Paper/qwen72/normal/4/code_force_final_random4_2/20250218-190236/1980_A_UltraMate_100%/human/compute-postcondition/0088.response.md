Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` and `m` are input integers.
3. `s` is an input string.
4. `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG'.
5. `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
6. `ans` is calculated as follows:
   - The number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m`.
   - Plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Count the characters in `p` that are not in `s`**:
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'.
   - We need to count how many characters in `p` are not present in `s`.

2. **Calculate the first part of `ans`**:
   - Let `missing_chars` be the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s`.
   - The first part of `ans` is `missing_chars * m`.

3. **Calculate the second part of `ans`**:
   - For each character `i` in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`, compute `(m - hmp[i])`.
   - Sum these values to get the second part of `ans`.

4. **Combine the two parts**:
   - `ans` is the sum of the two parts calculated above.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the calculation:
- `n = 7` (length of `s`).
- `m = 3`.
- `s = "ABBCD"`.

1. **Count the characters in `p` that are not in `s`**:
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'.
   - Characters in `p` but not in `s`: 'E', 'F', 'G'.
   - `missing_chars = 3`.

2. **Calculate the first part of `ans`**:
   - `missing_chars * m = 3 * 3 = 9`.

3. **Calculate the second part of `ans`**:
   - `hmp` for `s = "ABBCD"` is:
     - `hmp['A'] = 1`
     - `hmp['B'] = 2`
     - `hmp['C'] = 1`
     - `hmp['D'] = 1`
   - Characters in `s` with frequency less than `m`:
     - 'A' (frequency 1, `m - hmp['A'] = 3 - 1 = 2`)
     - 'B' (frequency 2, `m - hmp['B'] = 3 - 2 = 1`)
     - 'C' (frequency 1, `m - hmp['C'] = 3 - 1 = 2`)
     - 'D' (frequency 1, `m - hmp['D'] = 3 - 1 = 2`)
   - Sum of these values: `2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7`.

4. **Combine the two parts**:
   - `ans = 9 + 7 = 16`.

### General Description:
- The number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` is `missing_chars`.
- The first part of `ans` is `missing_chars * m`.
- The second part of `ans` is the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`.
- The final value of `ans` is the sum of these two parts.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans` based on the given formula.
Output: **ans (where ans is the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not in s multiplied by m plus the sum of (m - hmp[i]) for each character i in s that has a frequency less than m)**
