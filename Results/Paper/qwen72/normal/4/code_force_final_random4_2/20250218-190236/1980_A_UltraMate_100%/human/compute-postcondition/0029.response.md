To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans` step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is an input string.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG'.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each character in `s`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp`:**
   - For each character `i` in the string 'ABCDEFG', if `i` is not in `hmp`, add `m` to `ans`.

2. **Sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`:**
   - For each character `i` in `hmp`, if the frequency `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, add `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Initialize `ans` to 0:**
   - `ans = 0`

2. **Iterate over each character in 'ABCDEFG':**
   - For each character `i` in 'ABCDEFG':
     - Check if `i` is in `hmp`:
       - If `i` is not in `hmp`, add `m` to `ans`.
       - If `i` is in `hmp` and `hmp[i] < m`, add `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `n = 7` (length of `s`)
- `m = 3` (a given integer)
- `s = "ABCD"`

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Counter `hmp` for `s = "ABCD"`:**
   - `hmp = {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}`

2. **Iterate over 'ABCDEFG':**
   - For `i = 'A'`:
     - `hmp['A'] = 1` (which is less than `m = 3`), so add `(3 - 1) = 2` to `ans`.
   - For `i = 'B'`:
     - `hmp['B'] = 1` (which is less than `m = 3`), so add `(3 - 1) = 2` to `ans`.
   - For `i = 'C'`:
     - `hmp['C'] = 1` (which is less than `m = 3`), so add `(3 - 1) = 2` to `ans`.
   - For `i = 'D'`:
     - `hmp['D'] = 1` (which is less than `m = 3`), so add `(3 - 1) = 2` to `ans`.
   - For `i = 'E'`:
     - `hmp['E']` is not in `hmp`, so add `3` to `ans`.
   - For `i = 'F'`:
     - `hmp['F']` is not in `hmp`, so add `3` to `ans`.
   - For `i = 'G'`:
     - `hmp['G']` is not in `hmp`, so add `3` to `ans`.

3. **Sum up all the values:**
   - `ans = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17`

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` which is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in hmp, plus the sum of (m - hmp[i]) for each character i in hmp that has a frequency less than m)**
