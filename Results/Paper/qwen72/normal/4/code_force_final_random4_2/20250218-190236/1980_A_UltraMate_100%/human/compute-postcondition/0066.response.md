Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 'A'. The character 'A' is not present in the input string `s` and therefore not in the Counter object `hmp`.**
