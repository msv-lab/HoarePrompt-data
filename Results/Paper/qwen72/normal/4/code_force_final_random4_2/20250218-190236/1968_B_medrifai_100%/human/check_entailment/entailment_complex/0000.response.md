### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` (denoted as `n` and `m` respectively).
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes three variables: `i` (index for string `a`), `j` (index for string `b`), and `c` (count of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`).

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings `a` and `b` as long as `i` is less than `n` and `j` is less than `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the position of `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j`), it updates `j` to `new_j + 1` (to move past the found character in `b`), increments `i` (to move to the next character in `a`), and increments `c` (to count the matched character).
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the current character `a[i]` cannot be found in the remaining part of `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the current character `a[i]` and searches for it in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence relative to the start of `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which represents the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `k` such that the prefix of `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of `b`.
- The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from `j`, which is a valid approach.
- The loop breaks as soon as a character in `a` cannot be found in the remaining part of `b`, which ensures that the program stops at the correct point.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and matches the problem description. It correctly handles all the given constraints and test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
