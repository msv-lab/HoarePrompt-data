You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if index != -1:
        return j + index
    else:
        return -1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the string `b`, starting from index `j`. If the character `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from index `j`, it returns -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the lengths \( n \) and \( m \) of strings \( a \) and \( b \), respectively, and the strings themselves.

2. **Subsequence Check**: The program uses a nested function `func_1` to find the next occurrence of the character \( a[i] \) in the string \( b \) starting from index \( j \). This function returns the index of the next occurrence or -1 if the character is not found.

3. **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates through the characters of string \( a \) and string \( b \) to find the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \). It uses two pointers \( i \) and \( j \) to track the current positions in \( a \) and \( b \), respectively. The variable \( c \) keeps track of the length of the longest prefix found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( a \) is empty, the program will correctly output 0.
   - If \( b \) is empty, the program will correctly output 0.
   - If \( a \) is a subsequence of \( b \), the program will correctly find the maximum \( k \).

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the prefix of \( a \) is a subsequence of \( b \).
   - The program correctly handles the case where the prefix of \( a \) is not a subsequence of \( b \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( a \) is longer than \( b \) and ensures that it does not exceed the bounds of \( b \).

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
