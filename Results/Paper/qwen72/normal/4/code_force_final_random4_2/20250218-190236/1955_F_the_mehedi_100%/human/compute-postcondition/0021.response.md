The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `a`, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(x / 2) if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is math.floor(x / 2), `x` is the second element of `a`.**
