The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `_` and `cnt` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, the condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 is important for the context but not directly for the loop execution.

For the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty list of integers. The variable `x` will take the value of the first element in `a` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`_` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `x` is the first element in `a`**
