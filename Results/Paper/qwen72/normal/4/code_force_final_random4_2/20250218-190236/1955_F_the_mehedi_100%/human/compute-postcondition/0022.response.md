Output State: **`_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2) if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2), `x` is the second element of `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its previous value. The previous value of `cnt` was 1 + `math.floor(x / 2)` if the first three elements of `a` were all odd, otherwise it was `math.floor(x / 2)`. The value of `x` remains the second element of the list `a`. The value of `_` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
