Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements.
- `cnt` is defined as `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.
- `x` is the last element in `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements. Let's denote the elements of `a` as `a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.

2. **Variable `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is defined as `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.
   - This means `cnt` is updated by adding the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.
   - The floor division `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in `a` will result in an integer value that is the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.

3. **Variable `x`**:
   - `x` is the last element in `a`, which is `a[n-1]`.

### Calculation:
- The expression `sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)` will compute the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.
- Let's denote this sum as `sum_floor_division`.
- Therefore, `cnt` will be updated to `cnt + sum_floor_division`.

### Final Output:
- The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt` after it has been updated by adding the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.

Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the given information, the output will be the value of `cnt` after the update.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the initial value of cnt plus the sum of the floor division of each element in list a by 2)**
