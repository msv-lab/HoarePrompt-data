### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers one by one to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair's XOR is zero.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Bob wins if the total XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Alice wins if the total XOR of the sequence is non-zero.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence's XOR is zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of numbers (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.) will help in achieving a zero XOR.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are all even, the XOR will be zero.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are all odd, removing one number will make the XOR zero.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1. This is because removing one number from an all-odd count will make the XOR zero.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`. This is because each pair of numbers can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt` for each test case.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where all three counts are odd by adding 1 to `cnt`.
   - The program correctly adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt` to account for pairs of numbers.
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
