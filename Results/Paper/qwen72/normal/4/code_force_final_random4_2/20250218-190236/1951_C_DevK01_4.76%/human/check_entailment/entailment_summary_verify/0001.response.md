### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed. This is correct and necessary.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given the constraint that at most `m` tickets can be bought per day. This calculation is correct.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to form a new list `N`. This ensures that the cheapest days are considered first. This step is correct.

6. **Handling Exact Multiples:**
   - If the total number of tickets `k` is exactly `n * m`, the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula is correct because:
     - `m * sum(N)` accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days. This is derived from the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers, which represents the cumulative price increase.

7. **Handling Non-Exact Multiples:**
   - If `k` is not an exact multiple of `m`, the program pops the last element from `N` (the most expensive day among the selected days) and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` to be bought on that day.
   - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. This formula is incorrect because:
     - `mu * w` correctly accounts for the cost of buying the remaining `mu` tickets on the most expensive day.
     - `m * sum(N)` correctly accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the remaining `n-1` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` incorrectly accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on the first `n-1` days. It should be `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` to account for the price increase on all `n` days.
     - `n * m * mu` is an unnecessary term and does not correctly account for the additional cost due to the price increase on the most expensive day.

### Corrected Formula for Non-Exact Multiples:
- The correct formula should be:
  - `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) - m * m * (n - 1)`

### Potential Issues:
- **Incorrect Formula:**
  - The formula used in the non-exact multiple case is incorrect, leading to potential overestimation of the cost.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but contains an error in the formula used for the non-exact multiple case. This error can lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
