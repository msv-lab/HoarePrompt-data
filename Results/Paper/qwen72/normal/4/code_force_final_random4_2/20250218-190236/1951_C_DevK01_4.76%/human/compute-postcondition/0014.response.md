Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation: The variable `mu` is assigned the value `k - (n - 1) * m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mu` is calculated based on the given values of `k`, `n`, and `m`.
