### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input and stores them in the list `L`.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `M` for the `n` days.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that `m` is the minimum of the given `m` and `k`, which is correct because you can't buy more tickets per day than the total number of tickets needed.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list `M` to ensure that tickets are bought on the days with the lowest prices first, which is a good strategy to minimize the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets**:
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets, assuming you buy the maximum number of tickets `m` each day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**:
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`.

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that the number of days selected (`q`) multiplied by the maximum tickets per day (`m`) equals the total number of tickets needed (`k`). In this case, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means that the last day might have a different number of tickets bought (`mu`), which is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - The program removes the last element `w` from `N` and calculates the cost as `mu * w` for the last day.
     - It then adds the cost of buying `m` tickets on the remaining `n-1` days: `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`.
     - Finally, it adds the additional cost due to the price increase on the last day: `n * m * mu`.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation for the Last Day**:
  - The program incorrectly calculates the additional cost for the last day. The formula `n * m * mu` is not correct. The additional cost should only be applied to the days where tickets are actually bought, not to all `n` days.
  - The correct formula should be `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + mu * w + mu * (n - 1) * m`.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has an issue in the cost calculation for the last day, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + mu * w + mu * (n - 1) * m
        
        print(cost)
        
    # The loop has executed `t` times, and the cost for each test case is printed.

# Correctness: **False**
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The additional cost for the last day should be `mu * w + mu * (n - 1) * m` instead of `n * m * mu`.
- This ensures that the cost is correctly calculated for the last day, taking into account the price increase on the days before the last day.
