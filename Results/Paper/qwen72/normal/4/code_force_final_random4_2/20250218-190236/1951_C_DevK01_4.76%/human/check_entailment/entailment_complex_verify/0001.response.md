### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given the constraint that at most `m` tickets can be bought per day.

4. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to form a new list `N`. This ensures that the cheapest days are considered first.

5. **Handling Exact Multiples:**
   - If the total number of tickets `k` is exactly `n * m`, the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - **Issue:** The formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is incorrect. This formula is intended to account for the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days, but it does not correctly reflect the cumulative price increase. The correct formula should be `m * sum(range(n))`, which is `m * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.

6. **Handling Non-Exact Multiples:**
   - If `k` is not an exact multiple of `m`, the program pops the last element from `N` (the most expensive day among the selected days) and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` to be bought on that day.
   - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.
   - **Issue:** The formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` is incorrect. The term `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` is intended to account for the additional cost due to the price increase on the first `n-1` days, but it does not correctly reflect the cumulative price increase. The correct formula should be `m * sum(range(n-1))`, which is `m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`. Additionally, the term `n * m * mu` is redundant and incorrect.

### Correct Formulas:
- For exact multiples:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`
- For non-exact multiples:
  - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`

### Revised Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * (n * (n - 1) // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)
        
        print(cost)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** due to the incorrect formulas used for calculating the additional cost due to price increases. The program as originally written does not correctly compute the minimum cost in all scenarios.

Final: **False**
