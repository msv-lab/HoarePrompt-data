Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`, `cost` is `mu * w`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cost = mu * w` updates the `cost` variable by multiplying `mu` with `w`. The values of `mu` and `w` are already defined in the initial state, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial state information, with the addition of the updated `cost` value.
