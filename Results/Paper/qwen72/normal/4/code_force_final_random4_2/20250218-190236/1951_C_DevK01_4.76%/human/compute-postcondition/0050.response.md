Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`, `cost` is not yet updated, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `k` is the third element of the list `L`.
- `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `N` is the first `q-1` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`.
- `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `k`, `m`, `q`, `N`, `n`, `cost`, and `w` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `mu` is calculated and added to the output state.
