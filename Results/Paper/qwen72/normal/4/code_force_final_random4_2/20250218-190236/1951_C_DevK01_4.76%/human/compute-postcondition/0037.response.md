To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, we need to follow the steps described in the initial state and understand how the variables are computed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer greater than 1.
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input.
- `k` is equal to `L[2]` (the third element of `L`).
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
- If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.
- `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is the third element of the list `L`.

2. **Determine `q`:**
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. This means `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.

3. **Determine `N`:**
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.

4. **Check the condition `n * m == k`:**
   - `n` is the number of elements in `N`.
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `N` is updated to the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Output Calculation:
- **If `n * m == k`:**
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`
  - Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the sum of the first `n - 1` natural numbers.

- **Otherwise:**
  - `N` is updated to the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
  - `w` is the `q`-th element of `M`.
  - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
  - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`
  - Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, and `((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` is the sum of the first `n - 2` natural numbers.

### Final Output:
The `print(cost)` statement will print the value of `cost` based on the conditions described. Since the exact values of `L`, `M`, and `m` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions described in the initial state)**

### Explanation:
- **If `n * m == k`:**
  - `cost` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M` multiplied by `m`, plus `m` squared times the sum of the first `n - 1` natural numbers.

- **Otherwise:**
  - `cost` is the sum of the first `q - 1` elements of `M` multiplied by `m`, plus `mu` times the `q`-th element of `M`, plus `m` squared times the sum of the first `n - 2` natural numbers, plus `n * m * mu`.

This output is the most precise description possible based on the given initial state.
