Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input by the user. For each iteration, `L` and `M` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `n` is the number of sale days, `m` is the minimum of the maximum tickets purchasable each day and the number of tickets to be bought, `k` is the number of tickets to be bought, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, and `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`. If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, the last element `w` is removed from `N`, `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and the cost is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `cost` for each test case is printed, and the loop continues to the next iteration until all `t` iterations are completed.**

In natural language:
- The loop has run a total of `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are set based on the user input.
- The list `M` is sorted, and `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`.
- The list `N` is updated to contain the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`.
- If the product of `n` and `m` equals `k`, the cost is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise, the last element `w` is removed from `N`, `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and the cost is updated using the formula `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.
- The cost for each test case is printed, and the loop moves to the next test case until all `t` test cases have been processed.
