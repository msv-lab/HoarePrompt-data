You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input by the user. For each iteration, `L` and `M` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `n` is the number of sale days, `m` is the minimum of the maximum tickets purchasable each day and the number of tickets to be bought, `k` is the number of tickets to be bought, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, and `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`. If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, the last element `w` is removed from `N`, `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and the cost is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `cost` for each test case is printed, and the loop continues to the next iteration until all `t` iterations are completed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. The second line contains a list of `n` integers `a`, representing the price per ticket for each of the `n` days. The function calculates the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` sale days, considering the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day. It prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given the constraint that at most `m` tickets can be bought per day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to form a new list `N`. This ensures that the cheapest days are considered first.

6. **Handling Exact Multiples:**
   - If the total number of tickets `k` is exactly `n * m`, the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `n` days and the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.

7. **Handling Non-Exact Multiples:**
   - If `k` is not an exact multiple of `m`, the program pops the last element from `N` (the most expensive day among the selected days) and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` to be bought on that day.
   - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w` (cost of buying `mu` tickets on the most expensive day) plus the cost of buying `m` tickets on the remaining days and the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.

8. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case and continues to the next test case.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is used to calculate the cost when `k` is an exact multiple of `m`. This formula is correct because:
  - `m * sum(N)` accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
  - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days. This is derived from the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers, which represents the cumulative price increase.

- The formula `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` is used to calculate the cost when `k` is not an exact multiple of `m`. This formula is correct because:
  - `mu * w` accounts for the cost of buying the remaining `mu` tickets on the most expensive day.
  - `m * sum(N)` accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the remaining `n-1` days.
  - `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on the first `n-1` days.
  - `n * m * mu` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on the most expensive day.

### Potential Issues:
- **Indexing and Length Calculation:**
  - The program uses `n = len(N)` after popping an element from `N`. This is correct because `n` is updated to reflect the new length of `N`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than or equal to `m` correctly by setting `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. The formulas used are appropriate and the steps taken are logical and consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
