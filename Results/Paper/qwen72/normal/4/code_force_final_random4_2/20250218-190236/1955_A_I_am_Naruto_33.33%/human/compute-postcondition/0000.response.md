The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be a positive integer. This is because the loop will iterate `int(input())` times, and if `int(input())` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. However, the loop head does not directly reference `t`. Instead, it depends on the user input converted to an integer. To ensure the loop executes, the user input must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the user input must be a positive integer.

State: **`_` is not relevant, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= t)**
