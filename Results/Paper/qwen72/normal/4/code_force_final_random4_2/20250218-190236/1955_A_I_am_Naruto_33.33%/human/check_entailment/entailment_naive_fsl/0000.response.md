Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints the price of one yogurt, which is `a`.
3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
   - **Regular Price Calculation**: The program calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`).
   - **Promotion Price Calculation**: The program calculates the total cost if the yogurts are bought using the promotion as much as possible (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).
   - **Minimum Cost Selection**: The program then prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

The logic in the program ensures that the minimum cost is always selected, taking into account both the regular price and the promotion price. The promotion price calculation correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by buying the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30), the program will work correctly for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
