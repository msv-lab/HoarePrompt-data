Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for `n > 1`**:
   - `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`, which represents the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
   - `ans2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, which represents the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

3. **Logic for `n <= 1`**:
   - If `n` is 1 or less, the program directly prints `a` because there is no benefit in using the promotional price for fewer than two yogurts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 or less by printing `a`.
   - For `n > 1`, the program ensures that the promotional price is used optimally by calculating the cost for pairs and the remaining single yogurts.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`: `ans1 = 10`, `ans2 = 9` (since `9` is the promotional price for two yogurts), so the minimum is `9`.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`: `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14` (since `9` for two yogurts and `5` for one yogurt), so the minimum is `14`.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`: `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 15` (since `11` for two yogurts and `5` for one yogurt), so the minimum is `15`.
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`: `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22` (since `11` for two pairs of yogurts), so the minimum is `20`.

The program's logic and calculations are correct and align with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
