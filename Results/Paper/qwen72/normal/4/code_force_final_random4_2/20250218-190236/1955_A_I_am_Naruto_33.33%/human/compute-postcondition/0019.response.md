Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned new values from the input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= t), and `a` and `b` are integers. If `n` > 1, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their new values, and `ans1` retains its original value (which was not defined in the initial state). `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The loop will execute one more time if the next `int(input())` is greater than 0.**
