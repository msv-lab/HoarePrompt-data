Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - `ans2` is the cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price (`b * (n // 2)`) and the remaining yogurts (if any) are bought at the regular price (`a * (n % 2)`).
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.
   - If `n` is 1 or less, the program simply prints the regular price `a` because no promotional price can be applied.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is 1, the program correctly prints `a` because you can only buy one yogurt at the regular price.
   - When `n` is 2, the program correctly compares the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) with the promotional price (`b`), and prints the minimum of the two.
   - For `n` greater than 2, the program correctly calculates the cost by maximizing the use of the promotional price and then adding the cost of any remaining yogurts.

4. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The formula `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` ensures that the maximum number of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining yogurts (if `n` is odd) are bought at the regular price.
   - The comparison `min(ans1, ans2)` ensures that the cheaper option is chosen, which is the correct approach for minimizing the total cost.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the program correctly prints `9` (promotional price).
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the program correctly prints `14` (1 promotional price + 1 regular price).
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the program correctly prints `15` (3 regular prices).
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the program correctly prints `20` (2 promotional prices).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all edge cases and correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
