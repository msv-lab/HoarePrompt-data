The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on or is called in a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement.

To accurately describe the functionality, we need to infer that the function likely processes these test cases and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the input parameters and the general context in which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
