Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`, `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` remain integers.
- `ans1` is still equal to `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. This means `ans2` is the result of integer division of `b * n` by 2, plus the remainder of `a * n` divided by 2.
