Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed correct. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Single Yogurt Case**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints the price of one yogurt, which is `a`. This is handled by the `else` block:
     ```python
     else:
         print(a)
     ```
   - This ensures that if Maxim needs to buy only one yogurt, he will pay the regular price `a`.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - **Regular Price Calculation**: `ans1 = a * n` calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - **Promotion Price Calculation**: `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` calculates the total cost if the yogurts are bought using the promotion as much as possible, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
       - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost for the maximum number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought using the promotion.
       - `a * n % 2` calculates the cost for any remaining single yogurt (if `n` is odd).

4. **Minimum Cost Selection**:
   - The program then prints the minimum of the two calculated costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.
   - This ensures that the program always outputs the least expensive way to buy `n` yogurts.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is even or odd, ensuring that the promotion is used optimally.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30), the program will work correctly for all possible inputs. The logic is sound and the calculations are accurate.

Final: **True**
