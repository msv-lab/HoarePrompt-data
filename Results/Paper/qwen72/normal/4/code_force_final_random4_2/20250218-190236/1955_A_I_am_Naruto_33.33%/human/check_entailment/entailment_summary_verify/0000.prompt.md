You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two values: `ans1` as `a * n` and `ans2` as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these two values. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints the price of one yogurt, which is `a`.
3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
   - **Regular Price Calculation**: The program calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`).
   - **Promotion Price Calculation**: The program calculates the total cost if the yogurts are bought using the promotion as much as possible (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).
   - **Minimum Cost Selection**: The program then prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

The logic in the program ensures that the minimum cost is always selected, taking into account both the regular price and the promotion price. The promotion price calculation correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by buying the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30), the program will work correctly for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
