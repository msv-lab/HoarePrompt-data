Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by reading three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program prints the price of one yogurt, which is `a`. This is correct because the promotion does not apply when only one yogurt is needed.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
   - **Regular Price Calculation**: The program calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`). This is straightforward and correct.
   - **Promotion Price Calculation**: The program calculates the total cost if the yogurts are bought using the promotion as much as possible (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`):
     - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
     - `a * n % 2` calculates the cost of buying the remaining single yogurt at the regular price if `n` is odd.
   - **Minimum Cost Selection**: The program then prints the minimum of the two calculated costs (`print(min(ans1, ans2))`). This ensures that the most cost-effective way to buy the yogurts is chosen.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is 1, the program correctly prints `a`.
   - When `n` is 2, the program compares `a * 2` (buying two yogurts at the regular price) and `b` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price), and prints the minimum.
   - When `n` is odd, the program correctly buys `n // 2` pairs at the promotion price and the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - When `n` is even, the program correctly buys `n // 2` pairs at the promotion price.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
     - `min(ans1, ans2) = min(10, 9) = 9` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 9 + 5 = 14`
     - `min(ans1, ans2) = min(15, 14) = 14` (Correct)
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 11 + 5 = 16`
     - `min(ans1, ans2) = min(15, 16) = 15` (Correct)
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22 + 0 = 22`
     - `min(ans1, ans2) = min(20, 22) = 20` (Correct)

The program's logic and calculations are consistent with the problem description and handle all edge cases correctly. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

Final: **True**
