Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` now contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, `_` is 1, `u` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `u - 2`, `v` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `v - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `u` is decremented by 1, so it is now `u - 2` (since it was already `u - 1` in the initial state).
- The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `_`, and `v` remain unchanged from the initial state.
