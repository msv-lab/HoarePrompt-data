    #The program returns the index of the largest integer in the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `l` and returns the index of the largest integer in the list. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the user receives the index of the largest integer in the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, but it internally reads an integer n from the standard input, where n is the number of vertices in the tree and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. It also reads n - 1 lines from the standard input, each containing two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= n, u != v) representing an edge between vertices u and v. The input is assumed to form a valid tree.

    n = int(input())

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a tree structure from the standard input, where the number of vertices `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^3, and `n - 1` edges are specified between the vertices. It then computes a path between two specific nodes in the tree and generates a list of operations based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, it generates operations centered around the middle node of the path. If the path length is even, it generates operations centered around the two middle nodes of the path. The function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves in a specific format and returns `None`.
