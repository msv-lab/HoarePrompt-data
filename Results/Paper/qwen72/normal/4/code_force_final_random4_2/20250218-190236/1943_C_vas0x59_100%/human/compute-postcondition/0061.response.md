The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, and `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(ci1, 1)`. After the code is executed, the new tuple `(c2, 1)` is added to `ops`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`.**
