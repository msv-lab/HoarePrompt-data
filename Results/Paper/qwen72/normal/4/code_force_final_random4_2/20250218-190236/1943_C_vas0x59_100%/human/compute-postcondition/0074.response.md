Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads a tree structure from the standard input, where the number of vertices `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^3, and `n - 1` edges are specified between the vertices. It then computes a path between two specific nodes in the tree and generates a list of operations based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, it generates operations centered around the middle node of the path. If the path length is even, it generates operations centered around the two middle nodes of the path. The function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves in a specific format and returns `None`. **
