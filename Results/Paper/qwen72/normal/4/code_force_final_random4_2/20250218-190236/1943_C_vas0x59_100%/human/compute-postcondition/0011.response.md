Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` now contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, `_` is 1, `u` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `u - 2`, `v` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `v - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is decremented by 1, so if it was initially `v - 1`, it is now `v - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
