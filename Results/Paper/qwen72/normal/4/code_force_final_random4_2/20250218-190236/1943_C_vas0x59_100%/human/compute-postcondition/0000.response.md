Output State: **The function does not take any parameters, but it internally reads an integer `n` from the standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree and 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^3. It also reads `n - 1` lines from the standard input, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 <= `u`, `v` <= `n`, `u` != `v`) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The input is assumed to form a valid tree. `n` is now a specific integer value read from the standard input.**
