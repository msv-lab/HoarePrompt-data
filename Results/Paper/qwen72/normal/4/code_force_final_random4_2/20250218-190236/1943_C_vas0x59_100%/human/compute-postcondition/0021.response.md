Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `_` is `n - 2`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the standard input and are now `u - (n - 1)` and `v - (n - 1)` respectively, `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node 0.**

Explanation:
- The `bfs` function is called with the starting node `0`. The function returns two values, and the first value is assigned to `d`, while the second value is assigned to `_`.
- The value of `_` is updated to the second value returned by the `bfs` function, but since the initial value of `_` was `n - 2`, the new value of `_` is the same as the second value returned by `bfs`.
- The variables `n`, `u2vs`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
- The variable `d` is now the result of the `bfs` function starting from node 0.
