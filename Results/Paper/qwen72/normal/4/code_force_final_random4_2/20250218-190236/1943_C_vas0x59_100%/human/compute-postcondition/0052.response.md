Output State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is a non-negative integer (the middle index of `path_ba`) such that `ci` is at least 1, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops` now includes the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, `c` is the middle node in the reversed path from `b` to `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 2, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c, 2)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
