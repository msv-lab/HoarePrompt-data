Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the special case handling in `func_2` where it returns `0` if `removals == 6 and negatives == 3` is not a general solution and does not align with the problem description. This special case is not justified and can lead to incorrect results for other inputs.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6 3 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
According to the problem description, Alice can remove up to 3 elements, and Bob can multiply up to 3 elements by -1. The optimal strategy for Alice would be to remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob would then multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. However, the program will return `0` for this case due to the special handling, which is incorrect.

The correct output for this case should be:
```
12
```
Explanation:
- Alice removes the smallest 3 elements: 1, 2, 3.
- The remaining array is: [4, 5, 6].
- Bob multiplies the smallest remaining element by -1: 4.
- The final array is: [-4, 5, 6].
- The sum is: -4 + 5 + 6 = 7.

However, the program will return `0` due to the special case, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
