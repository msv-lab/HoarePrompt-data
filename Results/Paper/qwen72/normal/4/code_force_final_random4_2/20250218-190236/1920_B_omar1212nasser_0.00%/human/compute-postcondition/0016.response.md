Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n), `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(i+1)]`, `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` to its current value.
- If the indices `-(negatives + i)` and `-i` are valid (i.e., they do not exceed the length of the list `elements`), the update to `n` is performed as specified.
- If the indices are not valid, `n` is set to 0.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `pos`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
