Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 0. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[x]`, and `ans2` remains equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` retain their initial values as described in the precondition.***
