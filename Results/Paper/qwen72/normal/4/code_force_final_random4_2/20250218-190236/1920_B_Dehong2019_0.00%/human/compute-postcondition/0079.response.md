Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]`.***
