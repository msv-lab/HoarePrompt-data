Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers.
- `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`.
- If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]` minus `2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+k-1])`.
- Otherwise, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`.
- `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Sum of all elements in `a`**:
   - Let's denote the sum of all elements in `a` as `total_sum`.

2. **Sum of the first `x` elements in `a`**:
   - Let's denote the sum of the first `x` elements in `a` as `sum_x`.

3. **Sum of the first `k` elements in `a`**:
   - Let's denote the sum of the first `k` elements in `a` as `sum_k`.

4. **Calculate `ans2`**:
   - `ans2 = total_sum - 2 * sum_x + sum_k`.

5. **Calculate `ans1`**:
   - If `i + x < n` (i.e., `k-1 + x < n`), then:
     - Let's denote the sum of elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` in `a` as `sum_x_to_x_plus_k_minus_1`.
     - `ans1 = total_sum - 2 * sum_x + sum_k - 2 * sum_x_to_x_plus_k_minus_1`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `ans1 = total_sum - 2 * sum_x + sum_k`.

6. **Determine `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, where:
- `ans2` is calculated as `total_sum - 2 * sum_x + sum_k`.
- `ans1` is calculated as:
  - If `k-1 + x < n`, then `total_sum - 2 * sum_x + sum_k - 2 * sum_x_to_x_plus_k_minus_1`.
  - Otherwise, `total_sum - 2 * sum_x + sum_k`.

Output: **max(ans1, ans2) (where ans1 and ans2 are calculated based on the given formulas and conditions)**
