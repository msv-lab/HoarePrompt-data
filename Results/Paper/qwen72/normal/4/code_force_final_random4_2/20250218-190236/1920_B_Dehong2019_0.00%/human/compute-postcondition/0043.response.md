Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans1` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans2` is now equal to the value of `ans1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
