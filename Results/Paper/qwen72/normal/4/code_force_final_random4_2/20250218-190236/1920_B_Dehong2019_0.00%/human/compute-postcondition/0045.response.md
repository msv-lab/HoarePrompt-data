Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans1` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans1` is updated to be the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, plus the first element of `a`. The value of `ans2` remains unchanged and is still equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
