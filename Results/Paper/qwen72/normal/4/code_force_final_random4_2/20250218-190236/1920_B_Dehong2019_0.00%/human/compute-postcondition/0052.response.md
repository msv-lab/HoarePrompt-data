Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans1` is `ans1 + a[1]`, `ans2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is incremented by the value of `a[1]`, which is the second element in the sorted list `a`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans2`, and `ans` remain unchanged, except for `ans1` which is updated.
- `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, but `ans1` has been updated to `ans1 + a[1]`.
