Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its previous value.
- The previous value of `ans1` was the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
