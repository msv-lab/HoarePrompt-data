Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 1, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by `a[2 + x] * 2`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `a[i + x] * 2` from its current value. Since `i` is 2, the new value of `ans1` is `ans1 - a[2 + x] * 2`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans2`) remain unchanged.
- `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, but `ans1` has been updated.
