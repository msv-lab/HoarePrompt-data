Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000) and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `p` is equal to the second element of `l`, `q` is equal to the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 2), `j` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0 if `q` is not 1, or `j` is 1 if `q` is 1.***
