The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop counter is not explicitly tracked or modified in the state, but the loop condition is based on the input value that determines how many times the loop should run. The loop will execute again if the current iteration is less than the input value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000)
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `i` is `n`
- `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not find an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`

The loop head is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` must be less than the input value. However, since `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state and is not modified between iterations, the state of the loop head does not change in a way that affects the loop's execution directly. The loop will simply proceed to the next iteration if the current iteration is less than the input value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same, except that the loop counter `_` is incremented, but this is not explicitly tracked in the state. The state of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` does not change in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not find an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`**
