The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a common placeholder used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used in the loop body. Therefore, we do not need to specify any particular state for `_`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct

We need to ensure that the loop will execute by adjusting the state of the input. The loop will execute if the input is a positive integer, which aligns with the given range for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and the input is a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 5000)**
