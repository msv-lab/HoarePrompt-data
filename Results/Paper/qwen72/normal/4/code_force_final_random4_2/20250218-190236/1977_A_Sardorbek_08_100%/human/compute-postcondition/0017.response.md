The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `a` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 1), and `a` must still be greater than `i` (so `a` must be greater than 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` and `c` are input integers, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` is not equal to `c`, then `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c` with the same or different parities.**
