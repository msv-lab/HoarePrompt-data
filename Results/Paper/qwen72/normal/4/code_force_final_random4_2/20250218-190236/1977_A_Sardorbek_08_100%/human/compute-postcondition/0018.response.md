Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` and `c` are input integers, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` is not equal to `c`, then `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c` with the same or different parities.** 

The values of `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, and the tuple `q` is now `(b, c)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
