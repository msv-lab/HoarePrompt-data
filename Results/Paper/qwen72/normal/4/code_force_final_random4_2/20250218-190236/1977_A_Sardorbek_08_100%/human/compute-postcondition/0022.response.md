The provided Python code snippet is simply a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
