### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` from the input. These represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` in the tower, respectively.
   - This part of the program is correctly implemented and matches the problem description.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is possible to build the tower by simply adding one cube per move. The program correctly prints "YES" in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build the tower because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
     - If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to build the tower. This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even, and this condition ensures that the final number of cubes can be achieved. The program correctly prints "Yes" in this case.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**
     - If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have different parities, it is impossible to build the tower. The program correctly prints "No" in this case.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement. The case of the letters does not matter, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: `b == c`**
  - If `b` is equal to `c`, the program prints "YES". This is correct because Nikita can add one cube per move to achieve exactly `c` cubes.
- **Case 2: `b < c`**
  - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
- **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
  - If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the program prints "Yes". This is correct because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even, and this condition ensures that the final number of cubes can be achieved.
- **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**
  - If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program prints "No". This is correct because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even, and this condition ensures that the final number of cubes cannot be achieved.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
