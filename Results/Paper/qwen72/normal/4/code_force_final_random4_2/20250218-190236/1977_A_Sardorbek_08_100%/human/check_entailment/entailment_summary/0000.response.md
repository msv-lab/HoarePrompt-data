### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` for each case.
2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes), the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the function prints 'Yes'. This is correct because the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even for the tower to end up with exactly `m` cubes. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes will only match the parity of the number of moves if the difference is even.
   - If `b` and `c` have different parities, the function prints 'No'. This is correct because if the parities are different, the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes will be odd, making it impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Output**: The function correctly outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, and the output is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct results for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
