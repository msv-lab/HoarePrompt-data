Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then reads `b` and `c` for each test case.
2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b == c`, it means Nikita can put exactly `c` cubes in `b` moves, so the answer is "YES".
   - If `b < c`, it means Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer is "NO".
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it means the parity (odd or even) of `b` and `c` is the same. This condition ensures that the number of moves `b` can result in a tower with `c` cubes, because the difference between `b` and `c` must be even for this to be possible.
   - Otherwise, the answer is "No" because the parity of `b` and `c` is different, making it impossible to achieve `c` cubes in `b` moves.

The program handles all the cases correctly and outputs the expected results for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
