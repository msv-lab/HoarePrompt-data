### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` which represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` respectively.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - The program checks if `b` is equal to `c`. If so, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to reach exactly `m` cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` have the same parity, the difference between them is even, and Nikita can achieve `c` cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.
   - If `b` and `c` have different parities, it prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` have different parities, the difference between them is odd, and Nikita cannot achieve `c` cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b` is equal to `c`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b` is less than `c`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b` and `c` have the same parity.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b` and `c` have different parities.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
