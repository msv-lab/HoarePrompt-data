Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `x-1`. If `x` > `y`, then `x` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. `x` must be greater than or equal to `x` for the loop to execute all iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x-1`, which is the last value it takes before the loop condition `i < x` becomes false. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are input integers, and the loop prints either `(x, y)` if `x` is greater than `y`, or `(y, x)` if `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The loop will have executed exactly `x` times, as `x` is the number of iterations specified in the loop head. The values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers input during the final iteration.
