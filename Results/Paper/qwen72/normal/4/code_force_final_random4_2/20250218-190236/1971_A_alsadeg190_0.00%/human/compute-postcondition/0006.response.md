The code snippet provided is:
```
print(y, x)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

The `print` statement will output the values of `y` and `x` in that order. Since `x` and `y` are input integers and `x` is less than or equal to `y`, the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, but we know the relationship between them.

Output: **y, x (where y is an input integer and x is an input integer such that x â‰¤ y)**
