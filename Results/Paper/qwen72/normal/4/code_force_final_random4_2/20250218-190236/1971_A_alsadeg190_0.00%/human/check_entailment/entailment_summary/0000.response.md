Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases, `x`, and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers, `x` and `y`, and prints them in ascending order. However, there is a logical error in the `if` statement where it prints the maximum and minimum values in the wrong order. The program should print the minimum value followed by the maximum value, but it does the opposite. This means the output will be incorrect for cases where `x` is greater than `y`.

Correctness: **False**
