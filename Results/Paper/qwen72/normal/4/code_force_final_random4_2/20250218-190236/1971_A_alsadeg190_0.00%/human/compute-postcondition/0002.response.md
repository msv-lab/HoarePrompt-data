Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- `x` and `y` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, where `input` accepts a string of space-separated integers, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers.
- The previous value of `x` (a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 9) is replaced by the new input value.
- `y` is a new variable that is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `i` remains unchanged and is still 0.
