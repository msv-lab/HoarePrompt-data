The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input. It then prints the two integers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `x` and `y` are the last input integers, and `i` is `x-1` (where `x` is the number of test cases).
