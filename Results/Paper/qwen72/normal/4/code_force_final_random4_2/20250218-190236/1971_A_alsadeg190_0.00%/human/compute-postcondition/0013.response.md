The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be greater than `i`, which means `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is 2. If `x` > `y`, then `x` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. `x` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.**
