You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that processes t test cases, where t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `x-1`. If `x` > `y`, then `x` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. `x` must be greater than or equal to `x` for the loop to execute all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input. It then prints the two integers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `x` and `y` are the last input integers, and `i` is `x-1` (where `x` is the number of test cases).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. Specifically, in the `if x > y` block, it prints `x, y` which is the maximum followed by the minimum, and in the `else` block, it prints `y, x` which is the minimum followed by the maximum. However, the problem description requires the output to always be the minimum followed by the maximum. This means the program will output the correct values in the wrong order for some cases.

For example, if the input is `1 9`, the program will output `9 1` instead of `1 9`. This is incorrect according to the problem description.
