The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0, which is the initial state provided.

- `n` is an input integer: This needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0: This is correct for the start of the loop and does not need to be adjusted.
- `res` is 0: This is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers from 1 to `n`: This is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0, which is already the case.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `res` is 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers from 1 to `n`**
