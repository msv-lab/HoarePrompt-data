To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

Given loop:
```
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `i` starting from `n` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
4. The loop condition is `i > 0`, so `i` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n - 1 - 1` which simplifies to `n - 2`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, but since `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least 2 for `i` to be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`**
