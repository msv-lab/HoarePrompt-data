Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `res` is the sum of ((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)) for i from 0 to `n-1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains the same as it was initially. The value of `i` is 0, which is the last value it takes before the loop condition fails and the loop terminates. The value of `res` is the sum of the expression ((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)) for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This means that `res` has accumulated the results of the expression for each iteration of the loop, from `i = n-1` down to `i = 1`.
