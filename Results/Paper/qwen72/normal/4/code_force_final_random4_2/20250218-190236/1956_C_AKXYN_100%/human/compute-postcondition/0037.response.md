The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, starting from `n` down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` is now `n - 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `i` must be greater than 0 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
