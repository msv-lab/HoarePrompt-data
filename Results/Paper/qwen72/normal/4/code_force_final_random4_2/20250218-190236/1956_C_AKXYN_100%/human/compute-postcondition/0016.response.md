Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be a non-negative integer.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` will be 4.

2. **Determine the value of `res`**:
   - `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - This is a mathematical formula, but it is not directly used in the print statement, so we don't need to compute it for this task.

3. **Format the print statement**:
   - The print statement uses a format string `'1 %d' % i` to print the value of `i` after the string "1".
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print each element separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
- Let's assume `n` is 5.
  - `i` will be `n-1` which is 4.
  - The print statement will be:
    ```python
    print('1 %d' % 4, *range(1, 5 + 1))
    ```
  - This will print:
    - The string "1 4" (from `'1 %d' % 4`).
    - The range from 1 to 5 (inclusive), which is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### General Case:
- For any `n` greater than 0:
  - `i` will be `n-1`.
  - The print statement will output:
    - The string "1" followed by the value of `i`.
    - The range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Final Output:
Output: **1 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-1] is the value of `i` and the range from 1 to `n` is printed)**
