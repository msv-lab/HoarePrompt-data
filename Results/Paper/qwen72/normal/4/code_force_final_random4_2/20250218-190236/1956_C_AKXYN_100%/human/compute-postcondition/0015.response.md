The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n-1` and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`**
