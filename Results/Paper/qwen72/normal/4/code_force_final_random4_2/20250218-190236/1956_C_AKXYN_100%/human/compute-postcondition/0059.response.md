The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates in reverse, starting from `n` and decrementing `i` by 1 each time until `i` is 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `n-1`, and `n` must still be greater than 0, but since `i` is now `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`**
