The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. It is designed to work with multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5. The function returns the result of processing these test cases, which is not explicitly defined in the provided information but is likely to be related to the n×n matrices.
