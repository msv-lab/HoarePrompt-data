The value of `res` is incremented by the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression evaluates to `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`. Therefore, `res` is incremented by 15. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is incremented by 15**
