Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterates over.
- The value of `res` is the sum of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The list `mat` remains unchanged, still containing `n` lists, each with integers from 1 to `n`.
