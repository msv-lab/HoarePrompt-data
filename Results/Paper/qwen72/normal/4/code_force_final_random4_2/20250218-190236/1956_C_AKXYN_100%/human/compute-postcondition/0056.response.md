The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1)` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` needs to start at `n` and decrement to 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to start at `n` and `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`**
