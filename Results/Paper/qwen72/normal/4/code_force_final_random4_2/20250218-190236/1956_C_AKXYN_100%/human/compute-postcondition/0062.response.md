The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop is decrementing `i` by 1 each iteration, starting from `n` and ending at 1 (inclusive). 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `n-2`. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `i` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, `n-2` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-2`**
