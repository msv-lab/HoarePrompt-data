You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, and for each iteration, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met for any `i` in the range 0 to `x - 1` during that iteration. If the condition was met, the loop printed 2 and broke early. If the condition was never met, the loop printed 3 after completing all iterations. The values of `t` and `p` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, where `2 <= n <= 50`. For each of the `n` iterations, it reads another integer `x` and a list `l` of integers from the user. It then checks if there exists any index `i` in the range 0 to `x - 1` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints 2 and breaks out of the inner loop. If no such index is found, it prints 3 after completing the inner loop. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external variables. The values of `t` and `p` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it always prints 2 if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and 3 otherwise. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
2 3 1
```
In this case, the friends form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1. To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to all 3 friends. However, the program will print 2, which is incorrect.

Another example:
```
1
4
2 1 4 3
```
Here, the friends form two pairs of mutual best friends: (1, 2) and (3, 4). To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp can send invitations to any one pair, so the correct output is 2. However, the program will print 3, which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly determine the minimum number of invitations required in these and other similar cases.
