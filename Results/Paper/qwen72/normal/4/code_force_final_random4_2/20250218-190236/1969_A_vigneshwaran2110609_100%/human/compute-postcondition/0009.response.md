Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the element at index `l[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to `i + 1`, then `flag` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without changing `flag`.***
