Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is `x - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is not changed unless the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met for any `i` in the range `0` to `x - 1`. If the condition is met, `flag` is set to True and the loop breaks. If the loop completes all iterations without the condition being met, `flag` remains unchanged and the program prints 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is `x - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met for any `i` in the range 0 to `x - 1`, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged. If the condition was met, the loop printed 2 and broke early. If the condition was never met, the loop printed 3 after completing all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `x` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is True if any `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` for 0 <= i < x, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged, `i` is `x - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
