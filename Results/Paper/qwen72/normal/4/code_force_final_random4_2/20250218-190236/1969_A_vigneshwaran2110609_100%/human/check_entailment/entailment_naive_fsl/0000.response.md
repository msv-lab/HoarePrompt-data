Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it always prints 2 if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and 3 otherwise. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
2 3 1
```
In this case, the friends form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1. To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to all 3 friends. However, the program will print 2, which is incorrect.

Another example:
```
1
4
2 1 4 3
```
Here, the friends form two pairs of mutual best friends: (1, 2) and (3, 4). To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp can send invitations to any one pair, so the correct output is 2. However, the program will print 3, which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly determine the minimum number of invitations required in these and other similar cases.
