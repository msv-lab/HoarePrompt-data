Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, and `same` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer. If `minn` is either `inf` or `len(ar)`, `minn` is updated to the value of `same`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`. If `minn` is `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, then `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)` and remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
