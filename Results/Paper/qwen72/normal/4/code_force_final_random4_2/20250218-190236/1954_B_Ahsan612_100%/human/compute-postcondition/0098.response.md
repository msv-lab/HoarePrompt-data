The value of `same` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `same` is either 2 or 1, depending on whether `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`. After the increment, `same` will be 3 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, and 2 otherwise. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `i` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `same` is 3 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `minn` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.**
