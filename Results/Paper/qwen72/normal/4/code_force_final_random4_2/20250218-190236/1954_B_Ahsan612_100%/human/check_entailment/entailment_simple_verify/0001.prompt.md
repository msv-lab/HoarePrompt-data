You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer. If `minn` is `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, then `minn` is updated to the value of `same`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it is no longer beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - If it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array. `minn` is set to infinity (`inf`).
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same (`same`).
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and continues.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the condition where the array is already not beautiful or where the array consists of a single element.
   - The logic to update `minn` and reset `same` is flawed. It should not reset `same` to 1 and continue the loop without properly handling the new element.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program should output `-1` for a single element array, which it does correctly.
   - **All Elements Identical**: The program should output `-1` for an array where all elements are the same, which it does correctly.
   - **Mixed Elements**: The program should correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. However, the current logic does not handle this correctly.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful.
   - If the array has only one unique element, it is impossible to make it not beautiful, so we should output `-1`.
   - If the array has more than one unique element, we should find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and remove them to break the beauty condition.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. Specifically, the way it updates `minn` and resets `same` is incorrect. It should properly handle the new element and ensure that the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is correctly identified.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = {}
        for num in ar:
            if num in freq:
                freq[num] += 1
            else:
                freq[num] = 1
        
        # If there is only one unique element, it is impossible to make it not beautiful
        if len(freq) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements
        min_consecutive = float('inf')
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            same = 1
            while i < len(ar) - 1 and ar[i] == ar[i - 1]:
                same += 1
                i += 1
            min_consecutive = min(min_consecutive, same)
            i += 1
        
        # If the minimum consecutive length is the length of the array, it is impossible
        if min_consecutive == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_consecutive)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful by properly handling the logic for consecutive identical elements and edge cases.
