Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
