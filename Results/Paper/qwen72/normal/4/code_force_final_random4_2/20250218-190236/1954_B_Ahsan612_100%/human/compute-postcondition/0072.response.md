Output State: **`i` is 5, 6, or 7 depending on the initial conditions, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `num` is the first or second integer in `ar` if `ar[i] == num`, otherwise `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `same` is 2, 3, or 4 if `ar[i] == num`, otherwise `same` is 1, `minn` is 1 or `inf` depending on the initial conditions, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 6.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 4, it becomes 5; if `i` was 5, it becomes 6; if `i` was 6, it becomes 7.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
