The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range, and it does not need to be adjusted as it will be set by the loop itself.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n
- The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5

The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the input must be a positive integer**
