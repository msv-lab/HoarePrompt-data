Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, and `same` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`, because the loop increments `i` until it is no longer less than `len(ar)`.
- **`minn`**: `minn` will be the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer. This is because the loop updates `minn` whenever it encounters a different integer, ensuring that `minn` captures the smallest such subarray length.
- **`num`**: `num` will be the last integer in `ar` because the loop updates `num` to the current element of `ar` whenever it encounters a different integer.
- **`same`**: `same` will be the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer. This is because the loop increments `same` for each consecutive occurrence of the same integer and resets it to 1 when a different integer is encountered. When the loop ends, `same` will reflect the length of the last contiguous subarray.
