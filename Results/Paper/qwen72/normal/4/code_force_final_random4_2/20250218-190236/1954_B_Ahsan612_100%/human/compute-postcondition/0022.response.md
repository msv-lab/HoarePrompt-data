Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1), `len(ar)` is greater than 1, `num` is equal to `ar[3]` if `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, or `num` remains equal to the first element of `ar` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 1.**
