The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to the value at index `i` in the list `ar`. Let's consider the different scenarios based on the initial state:

1. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, then:
   - `i` is 4
   - `num` is the first integer in `ar`
   - `same` is 3
   - `minn` is `inf`
   - After executing `num = ar[i]`, `num` will be updated to `ar[4]`.

2. Otherwise, if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`:
   - `i` is 5
   - `num` is the second integer in `ar`
   - `same` is 2
   - `minn` is 1
   - After executing `num = ar[i]`, `num` will be updated to `ar[5]`.

3. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`:
   - `i` is 6
   - `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`
   - `same` is 1
   - `minn` is 1
   - After executing `num = ar[i]`, `num` will be updated to `ar[6]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, then `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[4]`, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[5]`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 6, `num` is `ar[6]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
