Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5.
- **`a`**: Remains a list of integers of length `n` where each element is within the range 1 to `n`, and the array is guaranteed to be beautiful.
- **`ar`**: Remains a list of integers input by the user, with at least 2 elements.
- **`i`**: After the loop has finished executing, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`. This means the loop has processed all elements in `ar`.
- **`num`**: Will be the last integer in the list `ar`.
- **`same`**: Will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`.
- **`minn`**: Will be the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical integers found in `ar`. If all sequences of consecutive identical integers are of length 1, `minn` will be 1. If there are no sequences of consecutive identical integers, `minn` will remain `inf`.
