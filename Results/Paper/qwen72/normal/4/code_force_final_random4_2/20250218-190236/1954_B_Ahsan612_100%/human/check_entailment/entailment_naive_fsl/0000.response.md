Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is of length 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if the array has only one element, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, so the output should be -1. However, the program does not account for this edge case and will incorrectly output the minimum number of elements to remove, which is not the expected behavior.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1
1
```
The program will output:
```
1
```
But the correct output should be:
```
-1
```

This is because the array `[1]` is already beautiful, and removing the only element would result in an empty array, which is not considered in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
