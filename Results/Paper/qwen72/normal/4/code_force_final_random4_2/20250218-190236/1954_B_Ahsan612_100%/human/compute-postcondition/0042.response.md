Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer, and `minn` is either `inf` or `len(ar)` or the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `ar`.
- The length of `ar` is now assigned to `i`.
- The last integer in `ar` is assigned to `num`.
- The length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer is assigned to `same`.
- `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.

Since the initial state already describes the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and the constraints, these remain unchanged. The variables `ar`, `i`, `num`, `same`, and `minn` are updated based on the new input.
