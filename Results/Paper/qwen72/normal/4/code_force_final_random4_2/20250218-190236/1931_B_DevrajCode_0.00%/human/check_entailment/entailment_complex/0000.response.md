### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then converts the first element to an integer `n` and the rest to a list of integers `a`.
   - The problem description states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, but the program does not handle multiple test cases. Instead, it directly processes the input as if it were a single test case.

2. **Sum and Divisibility Check**:
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(a)`.
   - It checks if `total_water % n != 0`. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so this check is unnecessary and will always be `False`.

3. **Target Calculation**:
   - The target amount of water in each container is calculated as `total_water // n`.

4. **Redistribution Check**:
   - The program initializes a variable `container` to 0.
   - It iterates through each container's water amount and updates `container` by adding the difference between the current water amount and the target.
   - If `container` becomes negative at any point, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

### Analysis:
- The key insight is that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, and the target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
- The program's logic is based on the idea that if at any point the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target becomes negative, it is impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers equal.
- However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the fact that water can be poured from any container to any other container as long as `i < j`. The cumulative difference should be zero at the end of the process, but it can go negative and then positive again as water is redistributed.

### Correctness:
- The program will fail for cases where the water can be redistributed but the cumulative difference goes negative at some point. For example, consider the test case `a = [1, 0, 1]` with `n = 3`. The target is `0.666...`, and the cumulative difference will go negative, but it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers equal.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly handle all possible valid redistributions.

**Correctness: **False****

### Suggested Fix:
To correctly solve the problem, you should check if the total number of water units that need to be poured out (i.e., the sum of positive differences from the target) equals the total number of water units that need to be poured in (i.e., the sum of negative differences from the target). If they are equal, it is possible to redistribute the water.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    positive_diff = 0
    negative_diff = 0
    
    for water in a:
        diff = water - target
        if diff > 0:
            positive_diff += diff
        elif diff < 0:
            negative_diff += -diff
    
    if positive_diff == negative_diff:
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```

This version will correctly determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
