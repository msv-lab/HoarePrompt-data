Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the target amount of water each container should have, which is the average of the total water. It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the target amount. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No', indicating that it is not possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount of water. If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

However, there are a few issues with the program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list. This approach is not suitable for handling multiple test cases as described in the problem. Each test case should be processed individually.
2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `a` directly, but `n` is the number of test cases, not the number of containers. The list `a` contains all the numbers from the input, not just the water amounts for a single test case.
3. **Logic**: The logic for checking the cumulative difference is flawed. The program assumes that if the cumulative difference becomes negative at any point, it is impossible to redistribute the water. However, this is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to check if the cumulative difference is zero after processing all containers in a test case.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Process each test case individually.
- For each test case, calculate the target amount of water.
- Check if the cumulative difference (or imbalance) can be zeroed out by redistributing water from left to right.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    imbalance = 0
    for water in a:
        imbalance += water - target
        if imbalance < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

In the corrected version:
- The input is split into individual test cases.
- For each test case, the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a` are correctly extracted.
- The function `func_1` is called with the correct parameters for each test case.
- The results for each test case are collected and printed at the end.

Given the original program's issues, the correctness of the original program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
