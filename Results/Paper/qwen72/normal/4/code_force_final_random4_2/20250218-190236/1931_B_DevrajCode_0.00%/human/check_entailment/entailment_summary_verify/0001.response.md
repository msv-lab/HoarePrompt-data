### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `n` from the first element of the list.
   - The rest of the elements in the list are the water amounts for all containers across all test cases.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases separately. It only processes the first test case and then calls `func_1` with the total number of elements and the entire list of water amounts. This is incorrect because each test case should be processed independently.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it returns 'No'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - The function iterates through the water amounts and keeps a running total of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the running total becomes negative, it returns 'No' because it means it is impossible to balance the water without violating the condition \( i < j \).
   - If the loop completes without the running total becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic within `func_1` is correct for a single test case. It correctly checks if the water can be balanced by ensuring that the running total of the differences does not become negative.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. It should parse each test case separately and call `func_1` for each one.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It processes all input as a single test case, which is not the intended behavior. The function `func_1` itself is logically correct for a single test case, but the overall program structure is flawed. To fix this, the program should be modified to parse and process each test case independently.
