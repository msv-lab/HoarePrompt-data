### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `n` and the list of water amounts `a` from the input data.
   - This approach is efficient for reading large inputs but may not be suitable for interactive or multiple test cases where the input is provided line by line. However, for this problem, it is acceptable because the input is read in a single batch.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` is defined to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
   - It first calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(a)`.
   - It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. However, the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant and can be removed.

3. **Target Calculation:**
   - The target amount of water each container should have is calculated as `total_water // n`.

4. **Container Balance Check:**
   - The program initializes a variable `container` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the target amount.
   - It iterates through each container's water amount `water` in the list `a`.
   - For each container, it updates `container` by adding the difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than required to reach the target, and it is impossible to balance the containers using the given operation (pouring from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index). In this case, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n, a)` for the given input.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Redundant Check:**
  - The check `if total_water % n != 0` is unnecessary because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

- **Cumulative Difference:**
  - The key logic of the program is to ensure that the cumulative difference `container` never becomes negative. This is correct because if `container` becomes negative, it means that the total water in the containers with indices less than the current index is less than the required amount to reach the target, making it impossible to balance the containers.

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The program only handles a single test case, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The problem requires handling multiple test cases, and the program should loop through each test case and apply the function `func_1` to each one.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It only processes a single test case and does not loop through the input to handle each test case individually.

**Correctness: False**
