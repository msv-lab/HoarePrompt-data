### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle multiple test cases separately. The program reads all input at once and processes it as a single test case, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.
   - The problem description specifies that the input contains multiple test cases, and each test case should be processed independently. The program fails to do this and only processes the first test case.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is logically correct for a single test case. It correctly calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers `n`.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - The function iterates through the water amounts and keeps a running total of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the running total becomes negative, it returns 'No' because it means it is impossible to balance the water without violating the condition \( i < j \).
   - If the loop completes without the running total becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic within `func_1` is correct for a single test case. It correctly checks if the water can be balanced by ensuring that the running total of the differences does not become negative.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. It should parse each test case separately and call `func_1` for each one.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It processes all input as a single test case, which is not the intended behavior. The function `func_1` itself is logically correct for a single test case, but the overall program structure is flawed. To be correct, the program should parse each test case separately and call `func_1` for each one.
