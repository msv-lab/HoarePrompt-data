Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `2 * (water - target)`, `a` must have at least 2 elements, `water` is the second element in the list `a`, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `container` is updated by adding `water - target` to its current value.
- Initially, `container` was `water - target`.
- After the code execution, `container` becomes `2 * (water - target)`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
