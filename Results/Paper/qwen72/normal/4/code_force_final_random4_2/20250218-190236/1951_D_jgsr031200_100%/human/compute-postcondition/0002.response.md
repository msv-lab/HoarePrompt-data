The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes that `n` and `k` are positive integers with values such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and that the current values of `n` and `k` are equal. However, the `print` statement does not use `n` or `k` in any way. It simply prints the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
