Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `n` is `n % (n - k + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated by subtracting `i * curr` from its original value.
- `i` is `n - k + 1`.
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- Therefore, `n -= i * curr` is equivalent to `n -= (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`.
- The result of this operation is `n` being set to the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1`, which is `n % (n - k + 1)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
