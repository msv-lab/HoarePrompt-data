Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is 0, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is calculated as `n // i`.
- Given that `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` becomes `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
