Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1)`. `i` is 1. `curr` is `n % (n - k + 1)`. `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) - i * curr`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n % (n - k + 1) - i * curr`.
- Since `i` is 1 and `curr` is `n % (n - k + 1)`, the new value of `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) - 1 * (n % (n - k + 1))`, which simplifies to `0`.
- The other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`, `i`, `curr`) remain unchanged.
