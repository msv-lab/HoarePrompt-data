The given `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`. The precondition provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, stating that they are positive integers and that their current values are equal. However, the `print` statement does not use or reference these variables in any way. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **1**
