Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(n \neq k\).
- \(n \geq k\).
- `costs` is a list with two elements: \([n - k + 1, 1]\).
- `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` before the loop starts.
- `n` is the remainder after subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`.
- The current value of `h` is less than `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Costs Calculation:**
   - `costs` is \([n - k + 1, 1]\).

2. **Quotients and Remainders:**
   - The quotient of `n` divided by `costs[0]` (which is \(n - k + 1\)) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\).
   - The quotient of `n` divided by `costs[1]` (which is 1) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{1} \right\rfloor = n\).

3. **Sum of Quotients (h):**
   - `h` is the sum of these quotients: \(h = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n\).

4. **New Value of n:**
   - The new value of `n` is the remainder after subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`.
   - The product of `costs[0]` and its quotient is \((n - k + 1) \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\).
   - The product of `costs[1]` and its quotient is \(1 \times n = n\).
   - The new value of `n` is \(n - \left((n - k + 1) \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n\right)\).

5. **Simplifying the New Value of n:**
   - Let \(q_1 = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\).
   - The new value of `n` is \(n - (q_1 \times (n - k + 1) + n)\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(n - (q_1 \times (n - k + 1) + n) = n - q_1 \times (n - k + 1) - n = -q_1 \times (n - k + 1)\).
   - Since \(q_1\) is a quotient, it is a non-negative integer, and \(n - k + 1\) is a positive integer, the new value of `n` will be a non-positive integer (i.e., 0 or negative).

6. **Condition Check:**
   - The current value of `h` is less than `k`.
   - Given that `h` is the sum of the quotients and `n` is now non-positive, the condition `h < k` is satisfied.

### Final Output:
The code snippet `print('NO')` will print the string 'NO' because the condition `h < k` is satisfied, and the print statement is executed.

Output: **NO**
