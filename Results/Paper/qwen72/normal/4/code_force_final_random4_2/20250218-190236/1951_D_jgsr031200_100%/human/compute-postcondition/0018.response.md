Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1)`, `i` is 1, `curr` is `n % (n - k + 1)`, `n` is `n % (n - k + 1)`**

Explanation:
- `h` is incremented by `curr`, so the new value of `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1)`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, `i`, and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
