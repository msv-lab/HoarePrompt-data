Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` before the loop starts, and `n` is the remainder after subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`. If `h` < `k`, the current value of `h` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
