The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user. The user input must be greater than 0 and `n > st`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user. The first `st` elements of `a` are all equal. `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2. `_` is 2. `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`. `le` is the length of the list `a`. `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element. `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element. `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal. `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
