Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element and `l` must be less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is 2, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element and `l` must be less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is 3, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element and `l` must be less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is 4, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
