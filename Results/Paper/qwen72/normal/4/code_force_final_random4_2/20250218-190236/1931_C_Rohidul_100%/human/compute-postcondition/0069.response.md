Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`, and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.** 

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
