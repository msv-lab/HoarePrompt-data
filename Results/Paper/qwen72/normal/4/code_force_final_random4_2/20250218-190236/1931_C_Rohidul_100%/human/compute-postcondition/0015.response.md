Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and the first `st` elements of `a` must be equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The input integer must still be greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer, which must be greater than 0.
- The list `a` is still the list of integers provided by the user, but the first `st` elements of the list must be equal.
- The length of the list `a` (`le`) remains unchanged.
- The variable `l` is now equal to `st - 1`, indicating that the loop has moved the index `l` to the position just before the first element that is not equal to the initial elements.
- The variable `r` is still `n - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- The variable `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`.
- The variable `end` remains 1.
