Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`, and `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 3.
- All other variables (`a`, `le`, `r`, `st`, `end`, `ans`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, and the condition `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`) remain unchanged.
