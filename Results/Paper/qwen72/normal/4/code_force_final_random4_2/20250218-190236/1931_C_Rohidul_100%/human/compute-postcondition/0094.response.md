The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `arrays`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `arrays` contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list represents the elements of an array for a test case. Each inner list contains integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` with the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of each inner list `n` is the size of the array, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is determined based on the elements of the array.
