Let's break down the initial state and the code to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `le` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, and `l` must be less than `le - 1`.
   - `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element.
   - `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal.
   - `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`.
   - If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`.

2. **Code:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Determine the value of `ans`:**
   - We need to check if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
   - If they are equal, `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - If they are not equal, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - `le` is the total number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of the list that are equal.
   - `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal.
   - If the first and last elements are equal, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the total length of the list and the sum of the lengths of the consecutive equal elements at the beginning and end.
   - If the first and last elements are not equal, `ans` is the total length of the list minus the maximum of the lengths of the consecutive equal elements at the beginning or end.

5. **Output:**
   - If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, the output will be `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, the output will be `le - max(st, end)`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **ans (where ans is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`)**
