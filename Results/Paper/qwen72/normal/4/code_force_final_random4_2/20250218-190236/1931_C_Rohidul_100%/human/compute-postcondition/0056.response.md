Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, the first `st` elements of `a` are all equal, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal, and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the variable `r` will be the index of the last element in the list `a` that is not equal to the next element, and `end` will be the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal. The variable `ans` will be the maximum of 0 and the difference between the length of the list `a` and the sum of `st` (the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of the list that are equal) and `end` (the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal). All other variables (`a`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `le`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
