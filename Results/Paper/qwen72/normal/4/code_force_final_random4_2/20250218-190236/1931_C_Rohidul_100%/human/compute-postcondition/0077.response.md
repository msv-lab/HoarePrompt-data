Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `l` will be the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to the next element. The variable `st` will be the count of how many consecutive elements at the beginning of the list `a` are equal. The other variables (`r`, `end`, `ans`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial states. The loop will stop either when `l` is no longer less than `r`, or when the current element `a[l]` is not equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`.
