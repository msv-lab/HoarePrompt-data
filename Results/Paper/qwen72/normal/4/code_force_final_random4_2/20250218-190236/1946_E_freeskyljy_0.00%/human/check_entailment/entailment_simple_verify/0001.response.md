### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`.
   - It reads the lists `L` and `R` which contain the indices of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Initial Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` (prefix maximums) is equal to the first element of `R` (suffix maximums). This is necessary because the maximum element of the permutation must be both a prefix and a suffix maximum.
   - It checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This ensures that the smallest and largest elements are correctly placed.
   - It checks if `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1` and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. This condition ensures that the permutation does not have overlapping prefix and suffix maximums in a way that would make it impossible to form a valid permutation.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose the positions for the prefix maximums using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is because the maximum element (which is at both `L[-1]` and `R[0]`) is fixed, and we need to choose the positions for the remaining `N-1` elements.

4. **Processing Prefix Maximums:**
   - The program iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element, ensuring that the positions are correctly filled with the remaining elements.
   - It multiplies the answer by the number of available positions for each non-maximum element and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Processing Suffix Maximums:**
   - The program iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element, ensuring that the positions are correctly filled with the remaining elements.
   - It multiplies the answer by the number of available positions for each non-maximum element and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initial Validity Checks:**
  - The checks for `L[-1] != R[0]`, `L[0] != 1`, and `R[0] != N` are correct and necessary to ensure the permutation can be valid.
  - The check for `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1` and `L[-2] == R[1]` is also correct to ensure no overlapping maximums.

- **Combination Calculation:**
  - The combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is correct for choosing the positions of the prefix maximums.

- **Processing Prefix and Suffix Maximums:**
  - The logic for processing the prefix and suffix maximums is correct. It ensures that the remaining elements are placed in valid positions and the result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Issues Identified:

- **Function Signature:**
  - The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it should take `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` as parameters. This is a significant issue because the function is expected to handle these inputs, but it reads them directly from the input stream, which can lead to incorrect behavior if the function is called multiple times or in a different context.

### Corrected Function Signature:

```python
def func_1(N, M1, M2, L, R):
    if L[-1] != R[0]:
        return 0
    if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N:
        return 0
    if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]:
        return 0
    ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)
    cur = M1 - 2
    if M1 > 1:
        nums_left = L[-1] - 2
        i = L[-1] - 1
        while i > 1:
            if i == L[cur]:
                cur -= 1
            else:
                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            nums_left -= 1
            i -= 1
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    if M2 > 1:
        cur = 1
        i = R[0] + 1
        while i < N:
            if i == R[cur]:
                cur += 1
            else:
                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            nums_left -= 1
            i += 1
    return ans
```

### Final Evaluation:

- **Correctness:**
  - The program logic is correct, but the function signature is incorrect. The function should take the necessary parameters instead of reading them directly from the input stream.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The program is incorrect due to the function signature issue. If the function signature is corrected, the program will be correct.

Final: **False**
