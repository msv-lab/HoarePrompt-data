To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `i < N`. The variables `i` and `N` are the only ones that can be adjusted in the loop head.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `i` is updated to `R[0] + 1`.
- `M2` is greater than 1 (but not relevant to the loop condition).

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `N`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `R[0] + 1` is less than `N`.

Let's break it down:
- `i` is `R[0] + 1`.
- `N` remains unchanged.

To satisfy `i < N`, we need:
- `R[0] + 1 < N`
- This implies `R[0] < N - 1`.

Since `R[0]` is not directly adjustable, we need to ensure that `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.

State: **`N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, `cur` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution.**
