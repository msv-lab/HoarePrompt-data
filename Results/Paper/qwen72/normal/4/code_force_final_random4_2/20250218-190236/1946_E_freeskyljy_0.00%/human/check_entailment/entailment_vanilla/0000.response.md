### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`.
   - It reads the lists `L` and `R` which contain the indices of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Initial Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` (prefix maximums) is equal to the first element of `R` (suffix maximums). This is necessary because the maximum element of the permutation must be both a prefix and a suffix maximum.
   - It checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This ensures that the smallest and largest elements are correctly placed.
   - It checks if `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1` and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. This condition ensures that the permutation does not have overlapping prefix and suffix maximums in a way that would make it impossible to form a valid permutation.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose the positions for the prefix maximums using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is because the maximum element (which is at both `L[-1]` and `R[0]`) is fixed, and we need to choose the positions for the remaining `N-1` elements.

4. **Processing Prefix Maximums:**
   - The program iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element, ensuring that the positions are correctly filled with the remaining elements.
   - It multiplies the answer by the number of available positions for each non-maximum element and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Processing Suffix Maximums:**
   - The program iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element, ensuring that the positions are correctly filled with the remaining elements.
   - It multiplies the answer by the number of available positions for each non-maximum element and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The program returns the final answer, which is the number of suitable permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initial Validity Checks:**
  - The checks for `L[-1] != R[0]`, `L[0] != 1`, and `R[0] != N` are correct and necessary to ensure the permutation can be valid.
  - The check for `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1` and `L[-2] == R[1]` is also correct to ensure no overlapping maximums.

- **Combination Calculation:**
  - The combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is correct for choosing the positions of the prefix maximums.

- **Processing Prefix and Suffix Maximums:**
  - The logic for processing the prefix and suffix maximums is correct. It ensures that the remaining elements are placed in valid positions and the result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. It performs the necessary checks and calculations to determine the number of suitable permutations. Therefore, the program is correct.
