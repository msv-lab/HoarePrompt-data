The variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `R[0] + 3`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 3`.

State: **`N` is greater than `R[0] + 3`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is `R[0] + 3`, `cur` remains 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`**
