#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, m1, and m2, where n is the length of the permutation, and m1 and m2 are the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. Additionally, it should take two lists of integers, p and s, where p contains the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and s contains the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The values of n, m1, and m2 must satisfy 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5. The lists p and s must contain distinct integers within the range [1, n] and must be sorted in increasing order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads three integers `N`, `M1`, and `M2` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `L` and `R`. It checks several conditions and returns 0 if any of the following are true: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is not 1, the first element of `R` is not `N`, or if `M1` and `M2` are both greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If none of these conditions are met, the function calculates a value `ans` based on the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1` and updates it through a series of loops. The final value of `ans` is the product of certain elements, taken modulo `MOD`, and is returned.
