Output State: **`N` is greater than `R[0] + 3`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`, `i` is `R[0] + 4`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `cur` remains 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `R[0] + 4`.
- The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged.
- The value of `nums_left` remains `N - R[0] - 4`.
- The value of `ans` is still `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`.
- The condition for updating `cur` remains the same: if `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `cur` remains 1.
