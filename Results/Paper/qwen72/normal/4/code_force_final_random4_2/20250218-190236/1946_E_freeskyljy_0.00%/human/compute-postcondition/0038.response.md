Postcondition: ***`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged. If `M1` > 1, `cur` is updated to `M1 - (L[-1] - 1)` or `M1 - 2` depending on the number of times the if condition was true; `nums_left` is 1; `i` is 1; `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution. If `M1` is not greater than 1, `cur` remains `M1 - 2`.***
