Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged; `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 3. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is `M1 - 4`. Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2` and `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD`. If `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- `i` is initially `L[-1] - 2`.
- The code snippet `i -= 1` decrements `i` by 1, so `i` becomes `L[-1] - 3`.
- The other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `nums_left`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding `cur` and `ans` are still valid, but `i` has been updated to `L[-1] - 3`.
- `nums_left` is decreased by 1, as specified in the initial state.
