Output State: **`N` must be greater than `R[0] + 2`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `i` is `R[0] + 2`, `cur` is 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- `nums_left` is defined as `N - R[0] - 2`.
- The other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L`) remain unchanged.
- The variable `cur` remains 1 because the condition `i == R[cur]` is not checked in this snippet.
- The variable `i` remains `R[0] + 2`.
- The precondition that `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 2` is still valid.
