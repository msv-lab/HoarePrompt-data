Output State: **`N` remains unchanged, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is 1, `i` is `N`, `cur` is the number of elements in `R` that are less than `N`, and `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution, taken modulo `MOD`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`N` remains unchanged:** The total number of elements `N` does not change throughout the loop.
- **`M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged:** These variables are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- **`nums_left` is 1:** The variable `nums_left` starts at `N - R[0] - 1` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After `N - R[0] - 1` iterations, `nums_left` will be 1.
- **`i` is `N`:** The variable `i` starts at `R[0] + 1` and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After `N - (R[0] + 1)` iterations, `i` will be `N`.
- **`cur` is the number of elements in `R` that are less than `N`:** The variable `cur` is incremented each time `i` equals an element in `R`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `cur` will be the number of elements in `R` that are less than `N`.
- **`ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution, taken modulo `MOD`:** The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration where `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`. It multiplies the current `nums_left` value, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `L[1]` is encountered in `nums_left` during the loop, it is excluded from the product. The final value of `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]`, taken modulo `MOD`.
