The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than `R[0] + 2`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `i` is `R[0] + 2`, `cur` is `cur + 1`, and if `i` is equal to `R[cur - 1]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur - 1]`, `cur` is `cur + 1`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`.**
