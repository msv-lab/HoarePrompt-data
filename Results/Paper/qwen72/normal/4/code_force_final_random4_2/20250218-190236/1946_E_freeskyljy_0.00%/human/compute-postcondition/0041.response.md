Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged. `nums_left` is updated to `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is 1. `cur` is 1. `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution. `M2` is greater than 1.**
