The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` contains more than one node, the loop will execute again for the next node. At the end of the last iteration, `node` was the first node in `graph[ver]`, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must contain at least two nodes, and `node` will be the second node in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`q` has one less element than before, `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` must contain at least two nodes, `node` is the second node in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, then `vis[node]` is set to `1` (indicating `node` has been visited), and `q` has the same number of elements as before the operation.**
