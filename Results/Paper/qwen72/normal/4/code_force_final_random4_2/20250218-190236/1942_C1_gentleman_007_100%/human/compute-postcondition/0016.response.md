Output State: **`ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed and `node` appended to the right, `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `vis[ver]` is 1, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`**

The code appends `node` to the right end of the deque `q`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the modification to `q`. The deque `q` now has the leftmost element removed and `node` added to the right. The value of `ver`, the condition that `graph[ver]` is a non-empty iterable, `vis[ver]` being 1, and `node` being the next element in `graph[ver]` all remain valid.
