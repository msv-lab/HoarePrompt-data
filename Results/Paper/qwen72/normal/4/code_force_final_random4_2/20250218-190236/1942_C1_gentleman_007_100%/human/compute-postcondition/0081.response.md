Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` that contribute to the common subsequence between `a` and `b` as determined by the `dp` table, and `s` is a string formed by concatenating the elements of `l` converted to strings.**
