The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute for the next `node` in `graph[ver]`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`.
- `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed.
- If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is appended to the right end of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1.
- `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable.
- `vis[ver]` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `node` must be the next element in the iterable `graph[ver]`.
- `graph[ver]` must still be a non-empty iterable (i.e., it must have at least one more element).

State: **`ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed, `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `vis[ver]` is 1, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`**
