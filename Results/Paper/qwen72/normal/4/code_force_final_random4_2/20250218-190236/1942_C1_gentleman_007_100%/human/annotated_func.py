#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` accepts a sorted list of distinct integers `p` and an integer `x` within the range of the smallest and largest elements in `p`. It returns the length of `p` if `x` is greater than the maximum value in `p`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns the integer part of the square root of `x`. If `x` is 0 or 1, it returns `x`. For `x` greater than 1, it returns the largest integer `mid` such that `mid * mid` is less than or equal to `x` and `(mid + 1) * (mid + 1)` is greater than `x`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_21` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `mod`, where `a` and `b` are integers, and `mod` is a positive integer. It performs modular exponentiation, calculating `a^b % mod`. The function returns the result of this modular exponentiation, which is an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_22` accepts two non-empty lists of integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a string representing the longest common subsequence (LCS) of `a` and `b`, with the elements of the LCS converted to strings and concatenated in reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_23` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) that can be formed from the elements of `arr`. The input list `arr` remains unchanged after the function call. The returned value is the length of the LIS, which is a subsequence where the elements are in strictly increasing order.

After the function concludes, all vertices reachable from `ver` that were not previously visited are marked as visited in `vis`, and their order of processing is printed to the console. The `stack` used for the DFS is empty, and the `vis` list reflects the updated visited status of all nodes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, and graph is a dictionary or list of lists where each entry represents the adjacency list of a vertex. vis is a list of integers where vis[i] is 0 if vertex i has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited.
