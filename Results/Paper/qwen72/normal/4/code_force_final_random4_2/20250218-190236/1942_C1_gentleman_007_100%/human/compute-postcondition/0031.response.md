Postcondition: ***`q` has one less element than before, `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` must contain at least two nodes, `node` is the second node in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` was `False`, then `vis[node]` is set to `1` and `q` has the same number of elements as before the operation. If `vis[node]` was `True`, `q` retains one less element than before.***
