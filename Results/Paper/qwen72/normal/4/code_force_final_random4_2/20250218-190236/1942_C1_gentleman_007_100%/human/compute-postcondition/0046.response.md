Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `node` has been visited (`vis[node]` is `True`) and `node` is appended to `q`. `q` now contains `node` at the end of its list.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, but `node` is now appended to the list `q`, so `q` has `node` as its last element.
