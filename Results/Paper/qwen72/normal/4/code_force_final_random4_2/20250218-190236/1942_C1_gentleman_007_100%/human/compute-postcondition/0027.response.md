Postcondition: ***`q` has one less element than before, `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `node` is the first node in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, then `vis[node]` is set to `1` (indicating `node` has been visited), and `q` has the same number of elements as before the operation.***
