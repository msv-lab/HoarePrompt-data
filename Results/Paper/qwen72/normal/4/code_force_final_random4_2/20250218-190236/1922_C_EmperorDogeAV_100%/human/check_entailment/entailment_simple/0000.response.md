### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The city coordinates are converted to integers and stored in the list `cities`.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called to compute the closest city for each city in the list `cities`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n-1` elements, all set to 0.
   - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating that the closest city is the next one).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum for the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum for the backward direction, which is calculated after reversing the `cities` list and calling `func_1` again.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it prints the difference in the prefix sums for the forward direction.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints the difference in the prefix sums for the backward direction.

### Issues:
- **Closest City Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` has a logical error. It should always set `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the closest city is the next one, but it incorrectly sets it to the distance to the previous city in some cases.
  - Specifically, the condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` should always result in `prog_cities[i] = 1` because the closest city is unique and the cities are in strictly ascending order.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum calculation is correct, but it relies on the incorrect output of `func_1`.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The query handling logic is correct, but it will produce incorrect results due to the flawed `func_1` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
    
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the `func_1` function. The closest city should always be set to 1 if the next city is closer, but the program incorrectly sets it to the distance to the previous city in some cases.

**Correctness: False**
