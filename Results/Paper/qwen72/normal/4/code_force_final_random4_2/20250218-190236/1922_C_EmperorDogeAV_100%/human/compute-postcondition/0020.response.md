Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `back` is set to `cities[n - 2]`, `forward` is `cities[n]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `forward` is updated to `cities[i + 1]`, where `i` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `forward` is now `cities[n]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
