Postcondition: ***`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 2`. If `i` > 0, `back` is set to `cities[n - 3]` and `forward` is set to `cities[n - 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[n - 1]`. If `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[n - 2]` is set to `abs(cities[n - 1] - cities[n - 2])`.***
