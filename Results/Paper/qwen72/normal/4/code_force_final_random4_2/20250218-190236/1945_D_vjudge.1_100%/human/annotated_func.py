#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of integers of length n where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, and `i` is -1.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `ans` is the minimum value of the initial `ans` (which was infinity) and the sums `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 10^9. The function calculates the minimum value of the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` and the suffix sums of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. It prints this minimum value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` holds the minimum value of `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`. The input parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not modified.
