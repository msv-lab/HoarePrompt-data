### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program creates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is crucial because it determines the minimum cost Kirill would have to pay to move past each person in the queue.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`. This is done to efficiently compute the total cost of moving past all people from position `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - The suffix sum array is correctly initialized and populated in reverse order, ensuring that `suff[i]` contains the sum of all elements from `i` to `n-1`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost.
   - It iterates over the first `k` positions and for each position `i`, it calculates the cost of moving to position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This cost includes the cost to move to position `i` and the cost to move past all people from `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and the calculated cost.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Function Summary:
- The function summary states that `func_1` calculates the minimum value of the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` and the suffix sums of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- The state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` holds the minimum value of `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.
- This aligns with the program's logic, where `ans` is updated to the minimum cost calculated for each position from 0 to `k-1`.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `n = 4`, `k = 2`, `a = [7, 3, 6, 9]`, `b = [4, 3, 8, 5]`
  - `c = [min(7, 4), min(3, 3), min(6, 8), min(9, 5)] = [4, 3, 6, 5]`
  - `suff = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `suff[3] = 5`
  - `suff[2] = 6 + 5 = 11`
  - `suff[1] = 3 + 11 = 14`
  - `suff[0] = 4 + 14 = 18`
  - `ans = min(7 + 14, 3 + 11) = min(21, 14) = 14`
  - Output: `14`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `n = 6`, `k = 2`, `a = [6, 9, 7, 1, 8, 3]`, `b = [5, 8, 8, 1, 4, 1]`
  - `c = [min(6, 5), min(9, 8), min(7, 8), min(1, 1), min(8, 4), min(3, 1)] = [5, 8, 7, 1, 4, 1]`
  - `suff = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `suff[5] = 1`
  - `suff[4] = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - `suff[3] = 1 + 5 = 6`
  - `suff[2] = 7 + 6 = 13`
  - `suff[1] = 8 + 13 = 21`
  - `suff[0] = 5 + 21 = 26`
  - `ans = min(6 + 21, 9 + 13) = min(27, 22) = 22`
  - Output: `22`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `n = 7`, `k = 7`, `a = [7, 2, 9, 2, 6, 5, 9]`, `b = [9, 1, 10, 7, 1, 4, 9]`
  - `c = [min(7, 9), min(2, 1), min(9, 10), min(2, 7), min(6, 1), min(5, 4), min(9, 9)] = [7, 1, 9, 2, 1, 4, 9]`
  - `suff = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `suff[6] = 9`
  - `suff[5] = 4 + 9 = 13`
  - `suff[4] = 1 + 13 = 14`
  - `suff[3] = 2 + 14 = 16`
  - `suff[2] = 9 + 16 = 25`
  - `suff[1] = 1 + 25 = 26`
  - `suff[0] = 7 + 26 = 33`
  - `ans = min(7 + 26, 1 + 25, 9 + 16, 2 + 14, 1 + 13, 4 + 9, 9 + 0) = min(33, 26, 25, 16, 14, 13, 9) = 9`
  - Output: `9`

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 1`, `a = [2, 3]`, `b = [1, 1]`
  - `c = [min(2, 1), min(3, 1)] = [1, 1]`
  - `suff = [0, 0, 0]`
  - `suff[1] = 1`
  - `suff[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `ans = min(2 + 1) = 3`
  - Output: `3`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound and aligns with the function summary. The program efficiently computes the total cost of moving past people in the queue and ensures that Kirill can be among the first `m` people with the minimum cost.
