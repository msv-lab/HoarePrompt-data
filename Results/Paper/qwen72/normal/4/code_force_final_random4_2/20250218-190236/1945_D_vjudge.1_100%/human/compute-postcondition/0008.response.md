Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, and `i` is -1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 200,000.
- The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged and still contain integers within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The list `c` is unchanged and still contains the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
- The list `suff` is now updated such that each element `suff[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) contains the sum of elements from `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`. The last element `suff[n]` remains 0.
- The loop index `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
