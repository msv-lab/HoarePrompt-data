The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range parameters `n - 1` and `-1`. The loop is iterating in reverse, starting from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, and the loop has executed for the first time (in reverse order).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`.

The state of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff`) does not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, `suff[n - 1]` is `c[n - 1]`**
