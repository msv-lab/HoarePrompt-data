The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range parameters (`n - 1`, `-1`, `-1`). To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` based on the loop's behavior.

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
2. **Loop Behavior**: The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, starting from `n - 1` and going down to `0` (inclusive).
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `n - 3`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, `suff[n - 1]` is `c[n - 1]`, `suff[n - 2]` is `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`**
