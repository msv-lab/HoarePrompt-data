The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` should be 0 before the loop starts, as it will be the initial value for the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 0**
