Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`; `k`, a positive integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` positive integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it returns the total count of elements from the start and the end of the list `nums` that contribute to partial sums (`s_a` and `s_b`) which are each less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`, respectively. **
