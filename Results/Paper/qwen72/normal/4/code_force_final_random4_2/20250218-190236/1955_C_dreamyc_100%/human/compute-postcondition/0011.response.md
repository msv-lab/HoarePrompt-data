Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 0, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1]`, the current value of `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated value of `ans`.
