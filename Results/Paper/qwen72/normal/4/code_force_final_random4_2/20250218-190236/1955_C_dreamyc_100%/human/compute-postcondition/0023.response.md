The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 2, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0] + nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2]`, and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1.**
