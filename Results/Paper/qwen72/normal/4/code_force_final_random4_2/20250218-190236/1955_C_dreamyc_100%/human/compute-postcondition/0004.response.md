Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `nums`, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
