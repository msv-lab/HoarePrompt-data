### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check and Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` first checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n`, indicating that all ships will be sunk. This is a correct and efficient way to handle the case where the Kraken can sink all the ships.

2. **Calculating Attacks on First and Last Ships:**
   - The function then calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships using `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively. This is correct because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, so the first ship will be attacked one more time if `k` is odd.

3. **Loop to Simulate Attacks:**
   - The loop iterates through the list `nums` to simulate the attacks on the ships. It maintains two sums, `s_a` and `s_b`, to track the cumulative durability of the first and last ships being attacked.
   - For each ship `i`, it adds the durability to `s_a` and the durability of the corresponding last ship to `s_b`.
   - It checks if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` (number of attacks on the first ship) and if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b` (number of attacks on the last ship). If either condition is true, it increments the `ans` counter.

4. **Final Return:**
   - The function returns `ans`, which is supposed to be the number of ships sunk. However, there is a logical error in the loop. The loop increments `ans` for each ship that is attacked, but it does not account for the fact that a ship can be counted multiple times if it is both the first and last ship in the same iteration.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not properly handle the scenario where a ship is both the first and last ship in the same iteration. This can lead to overcounting the number of ships sunk.

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, we need to ensure that each ship is only counted once if it is both the first and last ship in the same iteration. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s_a + nums[i] <= a:
            s_a += nums[i]
            ans += 1
        else:
            break
        
        if i < n - i - 1 and s_b + nums[n - i - 1] <= b:
            s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
            ans += 1
        elif i == n - i - 1 and s_b + nums[n - i - 1] <= b:
            s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
            ans += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **First Ship Check:** We add the durability of the first ship to `s_a` and increment `ans` if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`. If the first ship's durability exceeds `a`, we break out of the loop.
- **Last Ship Check:** We add the durability of the last ship to `s_b` and increment `ans` if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. We also check if the current ship is the same as the last ship (i.e., `i == n - i - 1`). If it is, we only increment `ans` once and break out of the loop to avoid double-counting.

### Correctness:
- **Correctness: False**

The original program has a logical error that leads to incorrect results in some cases. The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct number of ships sunk is calculated.
