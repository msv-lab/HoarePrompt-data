The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, but still remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds. Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.** 

However, to be more precise about the state adjustment for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1` from the previous iteration), `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds. Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**
