Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers for each iteration. For each iteration, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the loop prints `n * a`. If `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. If `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, the loop prints `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the loop reads new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, the loop prints one of three possible results based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The conditions and their corresponding outputs are as follows:
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the loop prints `n * a`.
- If `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
- If `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, the loop prints `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
