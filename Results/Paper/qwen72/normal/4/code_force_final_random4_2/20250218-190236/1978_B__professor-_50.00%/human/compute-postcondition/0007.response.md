Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `b` is greater than `a`.
   - The difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`, i.e., \( b - a \geq n \).

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is: \( \text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) \).
   - Let's simplify the expression step by step:
     - \( 2 * b \) is simply twice the value of `b`.
     - \( 2 * b - n \) subtracts `n` from \( 2 * b \).
     - \( 2 * b - n + 1 \) adds 1 to the result of \( 2 * b - n \).
     - \( (2 * b - n + 1) * n \) multiplies the result by `n`.
     - \( (2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2 \) divides the result by 2.
     - Finally, `int(...)` converts the result to an integer by truncating the decimal part.

3. **Understanding the Expression:**
   - The expression \( \text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) \) can be interpreted as a formula for calculating the sum of an arithmetic sequence.
   - Specifically, it is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \( b - n + 1 \) and the common difference is 1.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence is \( \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d) \), where `a` is the first term and `d` is the common difference.
   - In this case, the first term \( a = b - n + 1 \) and the common difference \( d = 1 \).
   - Substituting these values, the sum becomes \( \frac{n}{2} \times (2(b - n + 1) + (n-1) \times 1) \).
   - Simplifying inside the parentheses: \( 2(b - n + 1) + (n-1) = 2b - 2n + 2 + n - 1 = 2b - n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to \( \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1) \), which is exactly what we have in the print statement.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b - n + 1 \) with a common difference of 1.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) (where int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) is the integer value of the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from b - n + 1 with a common difference of 1)**
