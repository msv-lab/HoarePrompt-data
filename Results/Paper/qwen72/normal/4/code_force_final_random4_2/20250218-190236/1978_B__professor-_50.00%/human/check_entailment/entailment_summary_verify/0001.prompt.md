You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it prints one of three possible results: `n * a` if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` if `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` if `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are undefined as they are re-assigned in each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks three conditions to determine the maximum profit:
     - **Condition 1:** `if b <= a`
       - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
       - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif b - a >= n`
       - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price.
       - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series with the first term `b` and the last term `(b - n + 1)`.
       - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is `n * (2 * b - n + 1) / 2`.
     - **Condition 3:** `else`
       - If the difference `b - a` is less than `n`, Bob should sell the first `(b - a)` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - (b - a))` buns at the usual price `a`.
       - The profit from the first `(b - a)` buns is the sum of the first `(b - a)` terms of an arithmetic series with the first term `b` and the last term `(b - (b - a) + 1)`, which simplifies to `(b - a + 1)`.
       - The profit from the remaining buns is `(n - (b - a)) * a`.
       - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** This condition is correct. If `b <= a`, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best strategy.
   - **Condition 2:** This condition is also correct. If `b - a >= n`, selling all buns at the modified price is the best strategy, and the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is correctly applied.
   - **Condition 3:** This condition is incorrect. The formula for the profit from the first `(b - a)` buns should be the sum of the first `(b - a)` terms of an arithmetic series, which is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) / 2`. The current formula `((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the sum of the series.

4. **Correcting the Formula:**
   - The correct formula for the profit in the third condition should be:
     - Profit from the first `(b - a)` buns: `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) / 2`.
     - Profit from the remaining `(n - (b - a))` buns: `(n - (b - a)) * a`.
     - Total profit: `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) / 2 + (n - (b - a)) * a`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the formula used in the third condition is wrong. The correct formula should be `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) / 2 + (n - (b - a)) * a`.

### Correctness:
**False**
