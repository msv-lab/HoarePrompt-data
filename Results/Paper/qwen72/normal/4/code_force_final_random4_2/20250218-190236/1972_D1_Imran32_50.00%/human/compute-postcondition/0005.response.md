Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 4.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + i) // cnt`.
- The expression `(n + i) // cnt` simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`, since `i` is 2 and `cnt` is 4.
- Therefore, `ans` is now equal to `n` plus the integer division of `(n + 2)` by 4.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `root`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
