### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in this range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Function Name and Parameters:**
     - The function `func_1()` should take \(n\) and \(m\) as parameters, but it is reading them inside the function. This is not a major issue but could be cleaner.
     - The variable \(k\) is used instead of \(m\), which is a mistake.
   - **Incorrect Logic:**
     - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - The loop and the calculation of `cnt` and the update to `ans` do not seem to be related to the problem statement.
   - **GCD Calculation:**
     - The program does not use the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - **Pair Counting:**
     - The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program is not correctly implementing the required logic.
   - The state of the program before the function call indicates that the function should take \(n\) and \(m\) as parameters.
   - The state of the program inside the function shows that the variable \(k\) is used instead of \(m\), which is a clear mistake.
   - The final state of the program shows that `ans` is calculated using a formula that is unrelated to the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - It uses an incorrect approach and does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as specified in the problem description. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the annotated code confirms these issues.
