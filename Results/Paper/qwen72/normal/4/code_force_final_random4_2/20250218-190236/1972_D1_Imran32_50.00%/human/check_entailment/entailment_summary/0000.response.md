Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program does not implement this logic at all. Instead, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(n\) and \(m\)), and then calculates a value `ans` using a different formula that does not correspond to the problem statement.

Here are the specific issues:
1. **Incorrect Function Name and Parameters**: The function `func_1` reads `n` and `k` instead of `n` and `m`.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `ans` using the formula `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)`, which does not relate to the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Missing Logic**: The program does not implement the logic to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these issues, the program is clearly incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
