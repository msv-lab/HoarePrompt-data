Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is not designed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Instead, it seems to be performing a different calculation that does not align with the problem's requirements.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, `func_1` is not correctly handling the input for each test case. It should read `n` and `m` for each test case, but it reads `n` and `k` instead.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**: The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It initializes `ans` to `n` and then iterates over a range from 2 to the square root of `n` plus one. It updates `ans` with a formula that does not correspond to the problem's requirement of checking if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

3. **Output**: The program prints `ans` after the loop, but `ans` is not the correct count of valid pairs.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement a function that iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected program correctly reads the input for each test case, iterates over all possible pairs (a, b), and checks the condition \( (a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \) to count the valid pairs. However, this solution might be inefficient for large values of `n` and `m` due to the nested loops. For a more efficient solution, you would need to optimize the counting process, possibly using mathematical insights or precomputation.
