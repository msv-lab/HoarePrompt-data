To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(2, root + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `root`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `root + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6
- `ans` is equal to `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4 + (`n` + 3) // 9
- `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1
- `i` is 3
- `cnt` is 9

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `root + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4 + (`n` + 3) // 9, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is 4, `cnt` is 9**
