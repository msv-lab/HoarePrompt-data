### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function takes a list `a` as input.
   - It calculates the length `n` of the list `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and stores the sorted version in `sorted_a`.
   - It concatenates the list `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - It then checks if any subsequence of `concatenated_a` of length `n` is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If no such subsequence is found after checking all possible positions, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings `data`.
   - It initializes an index `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - It iterates `t` times, each time reading the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, each on a new line.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The input is read and processed correctly. The number of test cases `t` is read first, followed by the length `n` and the array `a` for each test case.
   - **Functionality**:
     - The concatenation of `a` with itself (`concatenated_a = a + a`) is a clever way to check if the array can be sorted by a single swap of a prefix and a suffix.
     - The loop checks all possible subsequences of `concatenated_a` of length `n` to see if any of them match `sorted_a`.
     - If a match is found, it means the array can be sorted by a single swap, and 'Yes' is returned.
     - If no match is found, 'No' is returned, indicating that the array cannot be sorted by a single swap.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The function correctly handles the edge case where the array is already sorted.
     - It also handles the case where the array cannot be sorted by any single swap.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, the sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. No subsequence of the concatenated array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` matches the sorted array, so the function correctly returns 'No'.
   - For the input `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the sorted version is `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`. The subsequence `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` of the concatenated array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` matches the sorted array, so the function correctly returns 'Yes'.
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the sorted version is `[1, 2, 3]`. The subsequence `[1, 2, 3]` of the concatenated array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]` matches the sorted array, so the function correctly returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by a single swap of a prefix and a suffix. The input handling and the core logic are both correct.

Correctness: **True**
