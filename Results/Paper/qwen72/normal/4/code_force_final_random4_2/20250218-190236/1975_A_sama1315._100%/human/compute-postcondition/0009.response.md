Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts the elements from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]` (i.e., `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`) into integers and assigns them to the list `a`. The length of `a` is now `n`, and each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^6. The other variables remain unchanged.
