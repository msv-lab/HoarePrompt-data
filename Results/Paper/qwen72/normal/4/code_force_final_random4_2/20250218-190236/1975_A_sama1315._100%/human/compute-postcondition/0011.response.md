Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `2 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `result` is now the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the list `a` as its argument.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
