### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the array can become non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix).
   - It creates a concatenated array `a + a` to handle the circular nature of the problem.
   - It then iterates through the concatenated array to find a subarray of length `n` that matches the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Concatenation and Subarray Check**:
  - The concatenation `a + a` is a clever way to simulate the circular nature of the array. By concatenating the array with itself, we can check all possible rotations of the array.
  - The loop `for i in range(n)` ensures that we check all possible starting points for the subarray of length `n` in the concatenated array.
  - The condition `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a` checks if any rotation of the array matches the sorted version of the array.

- **Input Parsing**:
  - The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
  - It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `a` from the list.
  - The use of `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input list is appropriate and ensures that the input is parsed correctly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Single Test Case**: The program correctly handles a single test case.
  - **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each one.
  - **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, the program will return "Yes" because the sorted array is a valid subarray of the concatenated array.
  - **Unsortable Array**: If the array cannot be sorted by any number of prefix-suffix swaps, the program will return "No".
  - **Edge Case with Repeated Elements**: The program correctly handles arrays with repeated elements.

### Example Verification:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `6\n1 1 4 5 1 4`
  - Output: "No"
  - Explanation: No prefix-suffix swap can make the array non-decreasing. The concatenated array is `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. No subarray of length 6 matches the sorted array `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `5\n7 9 2 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array can be sorted by the operations described in the problem. The concatenated array is `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`. The subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted array `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no operation is needed. The concatenated array is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`. The subarray `[1, 2, 3]` matches the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem description and all edge cases. The concatenation and subarray check logic is sound, and the input parsing is done correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
