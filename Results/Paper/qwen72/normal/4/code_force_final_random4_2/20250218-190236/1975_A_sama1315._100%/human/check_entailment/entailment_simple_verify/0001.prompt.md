You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` and need to determine if it can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times.
   - The operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, then swapping these two parts.
   - The goal is to check if the array can be transformed into a sorted array by repeatedly performing this operation.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function `func_1(a)` takes an array `a` as input.
   - **Logic:**
     - The function first calculates the length of the array `n`.
     - It then creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
     - The array is concatenated with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
     - The function checks if any subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The idea of concatenating the array with itself is correct because it allows us to check all possible cyclic permutations of the array.
     - If any cyclic permutation of the array matches the sorted array, then the array can be sorted by performing the swap operation.
     - This approach is efficient and correctly identifies if the array can be sorted.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin`.
   - **Logic:**
     - It reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
     - It initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted.
     - It appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It uses `func_1(a)` to determine the result for each test case, which is correct as per the analysis of `func_1`.
     - The results are printed in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to solve the problem. The concatenation approach in `func_1` ensures that all possible cyclic permutations are checked, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
