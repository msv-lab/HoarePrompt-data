### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping).
   - It creates a concatenated array `a + a` to handle the circular nature of the problem.
   - It then iterates through the concatenated array to find a subarray of length `n` that matches the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

   **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The approach of creating a concatenated array `a + a` is valid because it simulates the effect of any number of prefix-suffix swaps.
   - The loop checks all possible subarrays of length `n` in the concatenated array, which is necessary to ensure that all possible splits and swaps are considered.
   - The comparison `concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a` is correct and ensures that the subarray is exactly the same as the sorted array.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted by returning "Yes" immediately if the original array matches the sorted array.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

   **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results in the required format, one result per line.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Single Test Case**: The program correctly handles a single test case.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each one.
- **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, the program will return "Yes" because the sorted array is a valid subarray of the concatenated array.
- **Unsortable Array**: If the array cannot be sorted by any number of prefix-suffix swaps, the program will return "No".
- **Edge Case with Repeated Elements**: The program correctly handles arrays with repeated elements.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `6\n1 1 4 5 1 4`
  - Output: "No"
  - Explanation: No prefix-suffix swap can make the array non-decreasing.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `5\n7 9 2 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array can be sorted by the operations described in the problem.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no operation is needed.

### Annotated Code Validation:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The state before and after the function calls and loops are accurately described.
- The logic and conditions in the annotations align with the problem description and the implementation of the functions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem description and all edge cases. The logic and implementation are sound, and the annotated code supports the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
