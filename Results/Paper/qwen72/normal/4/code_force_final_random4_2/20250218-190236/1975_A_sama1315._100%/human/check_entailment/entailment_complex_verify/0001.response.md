### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping these parts any number of times.
   - The key insight is that if the array can be sorted by this operation, then one of its cyclic permutations must be equal to the sorted array.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function `func_1(a)` takes an array `a` as input.
   - **Logic:**
     - The function calculates the length of the array `n`.
     - It creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
     - The array is concatenated with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
     - The function checks if any subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The concatenation of the array with itself is a valid approach to check all possible cyclic permutations.
     - The loop iterates through all possible starting points of the subarray in `concatenated_a` and checks if any of these subarrays match the sorted array.
     - This approach is correct because if any cyclic permutation of `a` is equal to `sorted_a`, then `a` can be sorted by the specified operation.
     - The function handles the constraints and edge cases correctly.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin`.
   - **Logic:**
     - It reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
     - It initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted.
     - It appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It uses `func_1(a)` to determine the result for each test case, which is correct as per the analysis of `func_1`.
     - The results are printed in the correct format, one result per line.
     - The function handles the constraints and edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to solve the problem. The concatenation approach in `func_1` ensures that all possible cyclic permutations are checked, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
