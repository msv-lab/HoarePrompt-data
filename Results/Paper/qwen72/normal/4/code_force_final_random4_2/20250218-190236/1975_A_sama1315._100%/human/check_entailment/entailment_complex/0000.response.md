### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determine if the array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the array).
   - **Logic**:
     - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
     - It checks if any subsequence of length `n` in `concatenated_a` is equal to `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If no such subsequence is found after checking all possible positions, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The logic is correct because if `a` can be split into two parts and swapped to form a sorted array, then the sorted array must appear as a subsequence in `a + a`.
     - The function correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Read multiple test cases from standard input, process each test case using `func_1`, and print the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads the input as a single string and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
     - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
     - It calls `func_1` with the list `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads and processes the input according to the problem description.
     - It correctly handles the constraints and the format of the input.
     - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to meet the problem requirements. The program will correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation and handle multiple test cases as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
