### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation multiple times. The operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, then swapping these two parts.
   - The goal is to check if any cyclic permutation of the array can result in a sorted array.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if any subsequence of the concatenated array `a + a` (which represents all possible cyclic permutations of `a`) is equal to the sorted version of `a`.
   - If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by performing the operation.
   - If no such subsequence is found, it returns 'No', indicating that the array cannot be sorted by performing the operation.
   - This approach is correct because concatenating `a` with itself allows us to check all possible cyclic permutations of `a` in a single pass.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the array `a` from the test case.
   - It collects the results of `func_1` for all test cases and prints them.
   - The function correctly handles the input format and the constraints specified in the problem.

4. **Combined Correctness:**
   - `func_1` correctly determines if an array can be sorted by performing the specified operation.
   - `func_2` correctly reads and processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each test case and printing the results.
   - Both functions together meet the problem description and handle all constraints and edge cases.
