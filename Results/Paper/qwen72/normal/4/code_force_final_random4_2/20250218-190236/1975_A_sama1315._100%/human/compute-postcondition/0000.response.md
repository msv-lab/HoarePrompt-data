Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.** 

The code snippet assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This changes the behavior of `input` from the default Python function to a function that reads from standard input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
