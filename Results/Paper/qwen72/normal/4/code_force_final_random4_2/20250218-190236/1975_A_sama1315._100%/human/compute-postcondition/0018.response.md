Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `a` is now a list of integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers.**

Explanation:
- The value of `result` is updated to the value returned by `func_1(a)`.
- The list `results` now contains the value returned by `func_1(a)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`) retain their previous values and conditions.
