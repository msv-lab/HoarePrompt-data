Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` - 2 and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `4 + 2 * n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` updates the list `a` to contain `n` integers from the slice `data[idx:idx + n]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged.
- The new `a` is a list of `n` integers, each converted from the corresponding string in the slice `data[idx:idx + n]`.
