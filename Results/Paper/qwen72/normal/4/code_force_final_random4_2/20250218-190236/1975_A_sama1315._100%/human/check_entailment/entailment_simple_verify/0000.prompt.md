You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

    data = input().split()
    idx = 0

- Annotated Code:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^6 for all i in the range 0 <= i < len(a).
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `a` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^6 for all i in the range 0 <= i < len(a). `n` is equal to the length of `a`. `sorted_a` is a sorted version of `a` in ascending order. `concatenated_a` is a list that contains the elements of `a` repeated twice. `i` is equal to `n`. If any subsequence `concatenated_a[j:j + len(sorted_a)]` for 0 <= j < n is equal to `sorted_a`, the program returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'Yes' and the loop completes without finding such a subsequence.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

    print('\n'.join(results))

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program provided seems to correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function checks if the array can become non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - It creates a concatenated array `a + a` to handle the circular nature of the problem.
   - It then iterates through the concatenated array to find a subarray of length `n` that matches the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Single Test Case**: The program correctly handles a single test case.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each one.
- **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, the program will return "Yes" because the sorted array is a valid subarray of the concatenated array.
- **Unsortable Array**: If the array cannot be sorted by any number of prefix-suffix swaps, the program will return "No".
- **Edge Case with Repeated Elements**: The program correctly handles arrays with repeated elements.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `6\n1 1 4 5 1 4`
  - Output: "No"
  - Explanation: No prefix-suffix swap can make the array non-decreasing.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `5\n7 9 2 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array can be sorted by the operations described in the problem.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no operation is needed.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and there are no obvious edge cases or logical errors, the program is considered correct.
