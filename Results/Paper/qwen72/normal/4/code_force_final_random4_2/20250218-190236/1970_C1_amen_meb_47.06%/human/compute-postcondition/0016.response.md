For a `while True` loop, the condition is always true, and the loop will continue to execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop head condition is `True` and does not depend on any variables or states, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is a list containing the sublists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`.**
