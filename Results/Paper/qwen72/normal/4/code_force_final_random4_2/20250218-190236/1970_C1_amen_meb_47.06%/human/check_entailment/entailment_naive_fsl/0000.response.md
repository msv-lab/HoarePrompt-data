Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` reads the input but does not construct the tree or determine the winner based on the starting node. The program also does not handle the specific case where the tree is linear (a path) and the starting node is one of the leaves, which should always result in "Hermione" winning. Additionally, the program does not reset the active nodes after each round, which is not relevant in this case since \( t = 1 \), but it indicates a lack of understanding of the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
