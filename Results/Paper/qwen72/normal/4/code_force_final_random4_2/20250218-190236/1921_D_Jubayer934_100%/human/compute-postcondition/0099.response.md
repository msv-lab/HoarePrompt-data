Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `_` is a placeholder variable (not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100.
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i` where the loop breaks or completes.
  - If `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `ans` contains the absolute differences from index `temp` to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`.
  - If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences from index 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(ans))
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` contains the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` from a certain starting index `temp` to the end index `n-1`.
   - The starting index `temp` can be either -1 or a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1`.

2. **Sum of `ans`**:
   - The `sum(ans)` function will compute the sum of all elements in the list `ans`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If `temp` is -1**:
  - `ans` contains the absolute differences from index 0 to `n-1`.
  - The sum will be the total of all these absolute differences.

- **If `temp` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ temp < n)**:
  - `ans` contains the absolute differences from index `temp` to `n-1`.
  - The sum will be the total of these absolute differences starting from `temp` to `n-1`.

### Output:
The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` from the starting index `temp` to the end index `n-1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `temp` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the absolute differences as described.

Output: **sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n-1` (where `temp` is either -1 or a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1`)**
