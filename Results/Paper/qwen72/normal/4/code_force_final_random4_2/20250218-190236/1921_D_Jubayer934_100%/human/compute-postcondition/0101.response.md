The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two lists of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, along with their respective lengths `n` and `m`. The function is expected to process these inputs and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the integers in the lists range from 1 to 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case, with the total number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 100, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5.**
