Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `temp` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, and `i` is 0. The program continues without breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 1, and `temp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2, `temp` remains 0 unless the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met, in which case `temp` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
