To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

1. **`i`**: This variable is the loop iterator. It starts at `temp` and will increment until it reaches `n`.
2. **`temp`**: This variable must be a valid starting point for the loop. Since `temp` is the index at which the loop breaks, it must be within the range of valid indices for the loop to execute.
3. **`n`**: This variable is the upper limit of the loop. It must be a positive integer, and `temp` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `_` is a placeholder variable (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a` (not relevant to the loop head).
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input (not relevant to the loop head).
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks (this will be updated by the loop).
- `temp` is an index at which the loop breaks, which is not -1.

To ensure the loop executes, we need:
- `temp` to be a valid starting index, which means `0 ≤ temp < n`.
- `n` to be a positive integer, which is already given as 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `i` to start at `temp` and increment until it reaches `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `temp`**
