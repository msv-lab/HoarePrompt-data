Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i + 1`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`.
- The index `i` is incremented by 1.
- The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences up to the index `i + 1`.
- All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
