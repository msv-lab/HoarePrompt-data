The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2, and `temp` is -1**
