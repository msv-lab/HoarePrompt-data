Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.**

The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and then assigns the first `n` elements of this sorted list to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
