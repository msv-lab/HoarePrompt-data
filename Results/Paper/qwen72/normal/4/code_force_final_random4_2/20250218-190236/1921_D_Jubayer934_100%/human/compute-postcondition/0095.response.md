The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `temp`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `temp` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented by 1).
- `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
- `temp` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n.**

To clarify the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `temp` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
