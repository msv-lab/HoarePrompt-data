The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `n` and `m` are now updated to the new input values, which must still satisfy the conditions that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100. The other variables (`t`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a`, where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks or `n` if the loop completes all iterations, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks, `temp` is -1 if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks. If `temp` is not -1, `temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `i` is `n - 1`, and `ans` has `n - temp` new elements, each of which is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n - 1`, and `t` must be greater than the current iteration count.**
