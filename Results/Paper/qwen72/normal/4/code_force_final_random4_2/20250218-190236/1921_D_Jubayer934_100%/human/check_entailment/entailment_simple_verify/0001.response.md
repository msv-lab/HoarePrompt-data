### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads `n` integers for array `a` and `m` integers for array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array `b` is sorted in descending order. However, the slicing `[:m]` is redundant because `b` is already of length `m`. This does not affect the correctness of the program but is unnecessary.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Difference:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It iterates over the first `n` elements of `a` and `b` and calculates the absolute difference between each corresponding pair.
   - The program checks if the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (i.e., the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `b` that hasn't been used yet) is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (i.e., the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `b`).
   - If this condition is met, it breaks the loop and starts appending the differences using `b[-(n - i)]` for the remaining elements.

4. **Summing the Differences:**
   - After the loop, the program sums up all the differences in the `ans` list and prints the result.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The idea of sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is correct because it ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
  - The program correctly checks if the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is a valid approach to maximize the total difference `D`.
  - The program then correctly appends the differences to the `ans` list and sums them up.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `m = n` by simply using the first `n` elements of `b` in descending order.
  - It also handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same as `a` by correctly calculating the differences and summing them up to zero.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting operations are efficient given the constraints (`n` and `m` are up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).
  - The program iterates over the elements of `a` and `b` only once after sorting, which is efficient.

### Potential Issues:

- **Redundant Slicing:**
  - The slicing `[:m]` on the sorted `b` array is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

- **Index Calculation:**
  - The index calculation `b[-(n - i)]` is correct but can be simplified to `b[-i-1]` for better readability.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately. The redundant slicing and index calculation do not affect the correctness but could be improved for clarity.

### Final Evaluation:
**True**
