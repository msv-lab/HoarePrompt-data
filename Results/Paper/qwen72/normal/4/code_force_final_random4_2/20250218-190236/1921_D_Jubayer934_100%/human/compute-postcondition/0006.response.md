The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is typical for `range(n)` in Python. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 0**
