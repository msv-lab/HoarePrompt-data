Output State: **`temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `temp + 1`, `ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `temp` remains an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n.
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- The value of `i` remains `temp + 1`.
- The list `ans` has a new element appended to it, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. This new element is calculated based on the current values of `i` and `n`.
