Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (i.e., `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`), `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `temp`, `temp` is a valid index (0 ≤ temp < n), `ans` now includes an additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`.**
