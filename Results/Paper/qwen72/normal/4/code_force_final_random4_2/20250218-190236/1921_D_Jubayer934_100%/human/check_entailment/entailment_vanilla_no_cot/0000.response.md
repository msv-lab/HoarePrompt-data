Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it selects elements from the array `b` to maximize the difference `D`. The algorithm attempts to match the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and then switches to matching the largest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `b` if the difference is greater. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible difference `D`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Matching Strategy**:
   - The program sorts `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.
   - It then tries to match the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and the largest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `b`.
   - This strategy is not optimal because it does not consider all possible combinations of elements from `b` to maximize the difference.

2. **Indexing Error**:
   - The program uses `b[-(n - i)]` to access elements from the end of the sorted `b` array. However, this indexing is incorrect because it should be `b[-(i + 1)]` to correctly access the elements from the end of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the difference `D`, Vasya should:
- Sort both arrays `a` and `b`.
- Use the largest possible elements from `b` to maximize the difference with the smallest elements of `a`.
- Use the smallest possible elements from `b` to maximize the difference with the largest elements of `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # To maximize the difference, we should pair the smallest elements of a with the largest elements of b
        # and the largest elements of a with the smallest elements of b.
        max_diff = sum(abs(a[i] - b[m - 1 - i]) for i in range(n))
        
        print(max_diff)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
- **Sorting**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted.
- **Pairing**: The smallest element of `a` is paired with the largest element of `b`, the second smallest element of `a` is paired with the second largest element of `b`, and so on.
- **Summing Differences**: The differences are calculated and summed to get the maximum possible difference `D`.

This approach ensures that the differences are maximized for each element in `a` by using the most extreme elements from `b`.
