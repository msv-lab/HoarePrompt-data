The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))` appends the absolute difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the element at index `-(n - i)` in list `b` to the list `ans`.

- `temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `i` is `temp`.

The value of `i` is `temp`, and the code appends the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]` to the list `ans`. The values of `temp`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `temp`, `ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`.**
