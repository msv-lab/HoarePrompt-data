Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Here's a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The numbers `0` and `2147483647` can be in the same group because their 31 least significant bits are complements of each other.
- However, the two `0` numbers cannot be in the same group because they have the same bits in all positions.
- The program incorrectly places the two `0` numbers in the same group, leading to an incorrect result of `2` instead of the correct result of `3`.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, where it does not correctly handle the case when multiple numbers with the same bit pattern are present. The program should ensure that each unique bit pattern (or its complement) is counted properly to determine the minimum number of groups required.
