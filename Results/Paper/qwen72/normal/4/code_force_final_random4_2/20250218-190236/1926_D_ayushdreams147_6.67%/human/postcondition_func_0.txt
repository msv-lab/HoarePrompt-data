The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element. The transformation effectively toggles the highest bit of each integer in the list. The function also modifies a dictionary `count` where each key is the transformed value of an element in `a`, and the value is the count of how many times the original element appeared in `a` minus the number of times the transformed value appeared in `a`.
