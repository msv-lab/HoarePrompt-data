You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is the transformed value of an element in `a` and the value is the count of how many times the original element appeared in `a` minus the number of times the transformed value appeared in `a`.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element. The transformation effectively toggles the highest bit of each integer in the list. The function also modifies a dictionary `count` where each key is the transformed value of an element in `a`, and the value is the count of how many times the original element appeared in `a` minus the number of times the transformed value appeared in `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Here's a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The numbers `0` and `2147483647` can be in the same group because their 31 least significant bits are complements of each other.
- However, the two `0` numbers cannot be in the same group because they have the same bits in all positions.
- The program incorrectly places the two `0` numbers in the same group, leading to an incorrect result of `2` instead of the correct result of `3`.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, where it does not correctly handle the case when multiple numbers with the same bit pattern are present. The program should ensure that each unique bit pattern (or its complement) is counted properly to determine the minimum number of groups required.
