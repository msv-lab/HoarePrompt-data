Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, `count[num]` is decreased by 1, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `count[num] -= 1` decreases the value of `count[num]` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `num` is a key in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is 0, this condition is still valid after the code execution. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and `num` is still the third element in the list `a`. The only change is in the value of `count[num]`.
