Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `a`. If `num` is not a key in the dictionary `count`, then `count` now includes the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with a value of 1, and `res` is incremented by 1. If `num` is a key in the dictionary `count`, then `count[num]` is decreased by 1, and `res` is 0.***
