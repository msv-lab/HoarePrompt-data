Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are new input strings with at least 2 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the original `kq1` string concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string, `x` is the integer value of the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the integer value of the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `kq1` is updated by concatenating the original `kq1` string with the string representation of `y`.
- All other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `q`, `vt`, `kq2`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
