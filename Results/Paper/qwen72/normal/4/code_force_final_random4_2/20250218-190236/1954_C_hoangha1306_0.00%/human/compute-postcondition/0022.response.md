Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 1, `i` is 0, the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `x` is the smaller integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b`. If the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
