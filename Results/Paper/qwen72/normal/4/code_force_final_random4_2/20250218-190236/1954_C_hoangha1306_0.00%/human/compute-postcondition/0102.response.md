Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 0. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of the first character of `a` plus the second character of `a`, and `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` or `b` depending on the initial condition, followed by the second character of `a`. If the second character of `a` is not equal to the second character of `b`, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `a`, `y` is the integer value of the second character of `b` if the second character of `a` is less than or equal to the second character of `b`; otherwise, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `b` and `y` is the integer value of the second character of `a`. If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is a string that includes the integer value of the second character of `a` as its first character, and `kq2` is a string that includes the integer value of `y` as its first character. If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` <= `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1` (if `kq1` was previously defined) or is simply the string representation of `y` (if `kq1` was not previously defined), and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2` (if `kq2` was previously defined) or is simply the string representation of `x` (if `kq2` was not previously defined). If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`.**
