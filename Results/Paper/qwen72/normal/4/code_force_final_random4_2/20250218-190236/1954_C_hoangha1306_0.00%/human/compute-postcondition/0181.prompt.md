Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is a string containing the characters from `a` and `b` that are equal, and for each pair of characters that are not equal, the character with the higher integer value if `vt` is 1, or the character with the lower integer value if `vt` is 0, `kq2` is a string containing the characters from `a` and `b` that are equal, and for each pair of characters that are not equal, the character with the lower integer value if `vt` is 1, or the character with the higher integer value if `vt` is 0, `vt` is 1 if there was at least one pair of characters in `a` and `b` that were not equal, otherwise `vt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, and `kq2` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` and `b` are the original input strings, `t` is the original input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1, `kq1` is a string that represents the result of the loop's logic for the first condition, and `kq2` is a string that represents the result of the loop's logic for the second condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
