Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `a` or `b` (whichever is smaller), `y` is the integer value of the second character of `a` or `b` (whichever is larger). If `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y` concatenated to the previous value of `kq2`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`.***
