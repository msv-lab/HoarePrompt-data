Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1, and `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `a`, and `kq2` is the first character of `a` if the first characters of `a` and `b` were equal, or the string representation of the minimum integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b` if they were not equal, followed by the third character of `a`. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the integer value of the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the integer value of the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.***
