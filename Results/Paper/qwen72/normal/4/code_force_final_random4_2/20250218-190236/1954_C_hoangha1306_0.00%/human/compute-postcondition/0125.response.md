Output State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `b` is the new input string, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is an empty string, and `kq2` is an empty string.**

The code snippet `kq2 = ''` resets the value of `kq2` to an empty string, overriding its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
