Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` and `b` are new input strings with at least 1 character, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `vt` is updated to 1, and `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the string representations of the maximum and minimum integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, respectively. If `vt` was already 1 before the if-else block, `kq1` is set to the string representation of the maximum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`.***
