The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here's the step-by-step thinking:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.

Given these constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases and returns a result for each case. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. To infer the functionality, we need to consider the typical behavior of such functions in algorithmic contexts. Commonly, such functions return a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m` such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
