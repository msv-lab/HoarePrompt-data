Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the function prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `m // a + m // b + 2`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed. **
