The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a value based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6, and `b` is a list of `m` integers each between 1 and 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs.**
