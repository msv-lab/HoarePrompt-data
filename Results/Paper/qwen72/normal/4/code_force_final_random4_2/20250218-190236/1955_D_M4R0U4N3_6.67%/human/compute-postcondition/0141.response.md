Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 2`, and `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `old` is removed from `extra` if `old` is in `extra`, and `a[r]` is added to `extra` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If `len(done) < k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.***
