The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1, and `m` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set, `extra` is a set containing the integer `a[0]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[j]` is no longer in `todo` if it was initially in `todo`.**
