Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` depending on the condition, `extra` is updated to include `a[2]`, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` remains empty.**

Explanation:
- The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `2` of the list `a` to the set `extra`.
- The value of `j` is `2`, so `a[2]` is added to `extra`.
- The states of the other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `r`, `ans`, `todo`, `done`) remain unchanged.
