Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is the set `todo` with the element `a[r]` removed, if `old` is in `extra`, `extra` is a set with `a[1]` removed, if `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is in `done`, `todo` also contains `a[1]` and `done` is the set `done` with the element `a[1]` removed, `ans` is 2 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `done` now contains `a[r]`.**
