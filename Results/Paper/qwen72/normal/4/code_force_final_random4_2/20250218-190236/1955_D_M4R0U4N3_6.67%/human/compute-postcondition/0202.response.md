Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `ans` remains unchanged unless `len(done) >= k` in the loop body, `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` as described in the if part.**

Explanation:
- `old` is reassigned the value of `a[r - m]`, which is `a[m]` since `r` is `m + 2`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `j`, `todo`, `ans`, `extra`, and `done` remain unchanged from the initial state.
