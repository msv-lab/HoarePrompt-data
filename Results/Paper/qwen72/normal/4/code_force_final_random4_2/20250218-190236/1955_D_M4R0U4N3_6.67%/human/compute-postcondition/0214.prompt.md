Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` during the loop iterations, `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` during the loop iterations, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `extra` is a set. If `len(done) >= k`, `done` is a set with the length greater than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` as described in the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `old` is in `extra`, `a[m]` is removed from `extra`, and `done` is updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `a[m]` is added to `todo`, removed from `done`, and `done` and `extra` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`. If `old` is neither in `extra` nor in `done`, `todo` and `done` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`, and `done` is updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`. If `len(done) < k`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` are not evaluated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
