Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `todo` is a set of integers from the new input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` depending on the condition.**

The code initializes `extra` as an empty set, which overrides any previous values that `extra` might have had. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
