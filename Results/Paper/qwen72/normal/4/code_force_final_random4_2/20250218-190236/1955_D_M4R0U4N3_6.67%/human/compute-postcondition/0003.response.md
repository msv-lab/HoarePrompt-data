The code snippet takes input from the user, splits it by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and then creates a set called `todo` containing these integers. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code, but the new set `todo` is created based on the input.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input.**
