The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `old` is removed from `extra` if `old` is in `extra`, `ans` is increased by 1, `done` and `todo` are updated based on the conditions for `old` and `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is added to `extra` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
