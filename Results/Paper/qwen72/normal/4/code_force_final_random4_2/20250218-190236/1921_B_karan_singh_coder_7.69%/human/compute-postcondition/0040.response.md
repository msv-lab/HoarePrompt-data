The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than the value of `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by `n`, and the loop condition is based on a fixed value provided by `int(input())`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `_` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The value of `int(input())` remains the same as it is determined at the start of the loop and does not change with each iteration.

Given that `_` was incremented by `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `int(input())`.

State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `_` is incremented by 1, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` if `s1` is not equal to `t1`, otherwise no further changes occur.**
