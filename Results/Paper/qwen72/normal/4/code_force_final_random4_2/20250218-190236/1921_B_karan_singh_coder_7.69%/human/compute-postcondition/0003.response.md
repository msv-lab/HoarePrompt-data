Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', and `f` remains unchanged. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0.**
