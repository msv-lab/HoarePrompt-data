Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ.
   - `_` is incremented by `n` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `s1` is not equal to `t1`.
   - `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement is `print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `cnt` represents the number of differing positions between the strings `s` and `t`.
   - `d` represents the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`. Since `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `d` is a positive integer (specifically, the absolute difference between the numerical values of `s1` and `t1` if they are treated as such).

4. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `(cnt - d) // 2`: This part of the expression calculates the integer division of the difference between `cnt` and `d` by 2.
   - `+ d`: This part adds `d` back to the result of the integer division.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` can be simplified to:
     - Let `cnt - d` be `x`.
     - `x // 2` is the integer division of `x` by 2.
     - Adding `d` back to the result of `x // 2` gives us the final value.

Given the initial state, the value of `cnt` and `d` are not explicitly provided, but we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(cnt - d) // 2 + d (where `cnt` is the number of differing positions between `s` and `t`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`)**
