Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 1. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is already True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.***
