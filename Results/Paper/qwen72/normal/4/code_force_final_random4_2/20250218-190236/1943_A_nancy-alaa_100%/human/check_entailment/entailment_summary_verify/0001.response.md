### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - For example, the MEX of `[0, 1, 2]` is `3`, and the MEX of `[0, 0, 1]` is `2`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob will both try to influence the MEX of `c` in their favor.
   - Alice will always choose the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and is available in `a`.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX by removing the smallest number that is available in `a` and not yet in `c`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the range from `0` to `n` to find the smallest number that is not in `c`.
   - The variable `first` is used to track if the first unique element has been encountered.

5. **Step-by-Step Execution:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - **Counting Elements:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - **Finding MEX:**
     - It iterates through the range from `0` to `n` to find the smallest number that is not in `a`.
     - If a number `i` is not in `a`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If a number `i` is in `a` and has only one occurrence, it checks if it is the first unique element. If it is, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

6. **Optimality Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest number that is not in `a` and prints it as the MEX.
   - However, the use of `first` to track the first unique element is not necessary and does not align with the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to always pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and is available in `a`.
   - The optimal strategy for Bob is to always pick the smallest number that is available in `a` and not yet in `c`.

7. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The variable `first` is used to print the first unique element, but this does not necessarily lead to the correct MEX in all cases.
   - For example, consider the array `[0, 1, 1, 2]`. The correct MEX should be `3` if both players play optimally. However, the program will print `2` because it encounters `1` first and sets `first` to `True`, then prints `2` when it encounters it.

8. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where all elements are unique or where all elements are the same.
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element.
   - However, it fails to handle cases where the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
