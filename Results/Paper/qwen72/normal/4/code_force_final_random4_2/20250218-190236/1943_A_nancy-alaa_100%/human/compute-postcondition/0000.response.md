The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If this value is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts does not provide any information about the input value, so we need to ensure that the input value is at least 1.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
