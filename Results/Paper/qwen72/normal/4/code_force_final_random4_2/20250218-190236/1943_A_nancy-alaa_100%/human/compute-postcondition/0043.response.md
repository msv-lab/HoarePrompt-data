Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`.
   - `first` is False.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0 in the initial state.
   - The condition that `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary does not affect the value of `i` itself, as `i` is simply an integer and not related to the keys in `mpp`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **0**
