Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, and the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
