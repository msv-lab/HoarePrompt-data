Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 0, and `first` is False. If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
