Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **_ is 1**: This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
2. **`n` is an input integer greater than 0**: This variable is not directly used in the print statement, but it is likely used to determine the length of the list `arr`.
3. **`arr` is a new list of integers input by the user**: This list contains integers, but the exact values are not specified.
4. **`mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`**: This means `mpp` is a dictionary-like object where the keys are the integers from `arr` and the values are the counts of those integers.
5. **`i` is 1**: This is the variable that will be printed.
6. **`first` is either True or False depending on the condition inside the loop**: This variable is not directly used in the print statement, but it might be used in the loop condition.
7. **If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**: This condition suggests that the loop or if statement checks if `i` is in the keys of `mpp`. If `i` is not found, the loop breaks.

Given the print statement:
```
print(i)
```

The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1. Since the print statement is outside any loop or conditional block, it will print the value of `i` regardless of the loop's behavior.

Output: **1**
