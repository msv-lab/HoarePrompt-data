Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True.
   - If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is already True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
   - The code snippet only contains a `print(i)` statement, which will print the value of `i`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the `print(i)` statement will print the integer 2.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **2**
