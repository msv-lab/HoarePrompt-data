The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 1, and `first` is False. If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
