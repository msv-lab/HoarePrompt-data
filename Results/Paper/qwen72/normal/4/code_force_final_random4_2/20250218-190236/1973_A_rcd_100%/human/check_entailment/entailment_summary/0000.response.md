### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - It correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

2. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Case When `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is at least as large as the sum of `p1` and `p2`, all the points in `p1` and `p2` can be attributed to draws, and `p3` can be the sum of the points from wins and draws.

4. **Case When `p3 < p1 + p2`:**
   - The function initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it tries to find values of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.
   - If such values are found, it prints `p1 - x + p3`.
   - If the loop completes without finding such values, it prints `p3`.

5. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop is designed to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the points `x` and `y` from `p1` and `p2` respectively.
   - The loop condition `while y >= x` ensures that `y` (the points from `p3`) is always greater than or equal to `x` (the points from `p1`).
   - The condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y` checks if the remaining points in `p1` and `p2` can be balanced by `p3` after some draws.
   - If this condition is met, the function prints `p1 - x + p3`, which is the total number of draws.
   - If the loop completes without meeting the condition, it prints `p3`, which is the maximum number of draws possible without violating the score constraints.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`).
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`).

### Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores. It handles all the edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
