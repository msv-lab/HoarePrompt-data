You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.

            while y >= x:

                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `_` is `t - 1`, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues with the same values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed. Otherwise, the loop completes, and `p3` is printed. After all iterations, `x` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `y` is `p3 - x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the user, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order (0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30). The function then checks if the sum of these scores is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. If the sum is even and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, it performs a loop to find values `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If such values are found, it prints `p1 - x + p3`; otherwise, it prints `p3`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no further state changes are made to the input variables.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, there is a logical issue in the way it calculates the maximum number of draws. Let's consider the case where the input is `3 4 5`:

- The total score is 12, which is even, so the program does not immediately return -1.
- The program then checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`, which is `5 >= 3 + 4` (False).
- It then enters a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. However, the logic inside the while loop is flawed. The loop tries to find values of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, but this does not necessarily lead to the correct maximum number of draws.

The correct maximum number of draws for the input `3 4 5` should be 6, but the program will not print 6. Instead, it will print 5, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
