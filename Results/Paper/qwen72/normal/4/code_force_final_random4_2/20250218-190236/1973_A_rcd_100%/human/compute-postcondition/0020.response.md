The variables in the loop head are `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `y >= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is equal to `p3`, and if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`.

Given that `y` is set to `p3 - 1` and `x` is set to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `p3 - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means `p3` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`, and `x` is 1, with `p3` being greater than or equal to 2**
