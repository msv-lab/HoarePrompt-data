The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. The code snippet does not change the values of `t` or `_`.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.**
