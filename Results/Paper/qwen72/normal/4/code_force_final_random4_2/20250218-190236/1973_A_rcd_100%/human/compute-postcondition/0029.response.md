Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4, `y` is set to `p3 - 2`, and `x` is set to 3.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
