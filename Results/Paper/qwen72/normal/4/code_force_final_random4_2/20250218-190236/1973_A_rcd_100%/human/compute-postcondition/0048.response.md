Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `y` is `p3 - 1`, `x` is 1, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` is now `p3 - 1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
