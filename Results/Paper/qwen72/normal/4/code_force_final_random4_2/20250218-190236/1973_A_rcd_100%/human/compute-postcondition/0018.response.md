The value of `y` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `y` was equal to `p3`, so after the decrement, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`. The condition `p1 - x > p2 - y` is still valid, as `y` has been decreased, making the right side of the inequality smaller. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`**
