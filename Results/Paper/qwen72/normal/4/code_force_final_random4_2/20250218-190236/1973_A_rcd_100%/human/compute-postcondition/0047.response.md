Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `y` is `p3`, `x` is 1, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` is now 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged:
  - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are still integers within the range 0 to 30, with `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3`.
  - `t` is still greater than 1.
  - `_` is still 1.
  - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still even.
  - `y` is still `p3`.
  - The condition `p1 - x > p2 - y` is still valid, but now `x` is 1.
