Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `x` is 1, and `y` is equal to `p3`. Additionally, `p1 - x > p2 - y`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` is now 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The condition `p1 - x > p2 - y` is still valid, but now `x` is 1 instead of 0.
