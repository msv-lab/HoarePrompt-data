Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `_` is 2 and `y` is decreased by 1.**
