### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Validation:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - The function checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even, as each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw).

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the function prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2` if `p3` is at least `p1 + p2`. This is because the third player can have all the points from draws, and the other two players can have the remaining points from draws or wins/losses.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the function enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop initializes `low` and `high` to the minimum and maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, respectively. It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If such a value is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding such a value, it prints `p3`.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop logic is intended to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the points of `p1` and `p2` to match the points of `p3` as closely as possible. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of draws. Instead, the correct approach is to calculate the total number of games and then determine the maximum number of draws based on the points.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The total number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the points are distributed in such a way that the maximum number of draws is possible. If the total points are not consistent with the possible outcomes of the games, the function should print `-1`.

### Correctness:
Given the flawed logic in the loop, the program is **incorrect**. The loop does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws, and the conditions inside the loop are not well-suited for the problem.

### Correctness: **False**
