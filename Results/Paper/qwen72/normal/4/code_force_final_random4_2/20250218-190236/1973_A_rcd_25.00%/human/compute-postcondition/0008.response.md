Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(p1 + p2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - From the initial state, we know that `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. However, this does not directly affect the value of `p1 + p2`.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd means that the sum of `p1` and `p2` must be even (since adding an odd number to an even number results in an odd number, and `p3` must be odd to make the total sum odd).

Given the initial state, the sum `p1 + p2` is an even number, but we don't have the exact values of `p1` and `p2`. Therefore, the output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which is an even number.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even number)**
