Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low`.**

The value of `cur` is now set to the value of `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
