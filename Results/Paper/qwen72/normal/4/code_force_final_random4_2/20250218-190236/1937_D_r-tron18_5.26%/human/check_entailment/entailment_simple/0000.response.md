### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s1` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list `arr` and an integer `times`.
   - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-l, -1 - times)`, where `l` is the length of `arr`.
   - The function is used to calculate the positions of the pinball based on the accumulated values of `preOne` and `suffZero`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the string `s1` of length `n` to determine the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>'.
   - It calculates the total number of '>' cells (`totalOne`) and the accumulated positions of these cells (`preOne`).
   - It initializes `suffZero` with a single element `0` and `ans` with a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - The function iterates over the grid from right to left:
     - If the current cell contains '>', it updates the answer based on the accumulated positions of '>' cells and the positions of '<' cells.
     - If the current cell contains '<', it updates the answer based on the accumulated positions of '<' cells and the positions of '>' cells.
   - The function prints the results for each test case.

4. **Logic and Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the grid cells.
   - The use of `accumulate` and the logic to update `ans` based on the positions of '>' and '<' cells is consistent with the problem description.
   - The program ensures that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps, as required by the problem.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case as a space-separated list of integers, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles the input and output as required.
