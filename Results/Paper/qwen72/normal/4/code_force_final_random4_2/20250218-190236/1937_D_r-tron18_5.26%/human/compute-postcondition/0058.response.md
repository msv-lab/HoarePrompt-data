Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements in `suffZero`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is 2 * the last element in `preOne`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.***
