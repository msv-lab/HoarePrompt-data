The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates in reverse, starting from `n - 1` and decrementing `i` by 1 until it reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1` and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 2`.

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the second last character of `s1`. If `el` is '>', and if `ol` (now 0) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), then the second last element of `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd` (where `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-2] - func_1(preOne, 1)` and `zeroInd` is 0), and `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is 0. If `el` is '>', and if `ol` is greater than `zr`, then `ans[i]` (where `i` is `n - 2`) is `n + 1 - fi` (where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`), `i` remains `n - 2`, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne` minus 1, and `zr` is 0. If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, `n`, `n - 1`], and if `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value `zeroInd - 2 * func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`. If `el` is '<', and if `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

However, since the task is to adjust only the state of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n`:

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5**
