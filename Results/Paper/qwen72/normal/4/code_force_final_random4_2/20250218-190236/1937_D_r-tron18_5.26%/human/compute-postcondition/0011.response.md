To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 0.
- `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.

Code:
```
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` is called with arguments `suffZero` and `ol`.
2. `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0.
3. `ol` is `totalOne`, and it is given that `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, which is 0. Therefore, `ol` must be 0.
4. Since `ol` is 0, the function `func_1` is called with `suffZero` and 0.
5. The function `func_1` is not defined, but we can infer that it might return a value based on its arguments. Given that `suffZero` is [0] and `ol` is 0, a reasonable assumption is that `func_1` returns 0.
6. Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, which is `2 * 0 = 0`.

Output State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`, and `ol` is 0.
- `zr` is 0.
- `zeroInd` is 0.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is 0, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0.**
