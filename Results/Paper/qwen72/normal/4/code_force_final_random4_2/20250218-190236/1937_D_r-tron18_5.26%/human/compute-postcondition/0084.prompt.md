Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`. If `el` is '>', and if `totalOne` (now `ol`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), then the last element of `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd` (where `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` and `zeroInd` is 0), and `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is 0. If `el` is '>', and if `ol` is greater than `zr`, then `ans[i]` (where `i` is `n - 1`) is `n + 1 - fi` (where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`), `i` remains `n - 1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne` minus 1, and `zr` is 0. If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, `n`], and if `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value `zeroInd - 2 * func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`. If `el` is '<', and if `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`. If `el` == '>', `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with its last element removed. If `ol` <= `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. If `ol` > `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `2 * suffZero[-1] - (func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr))`. If `el` != '>', `suffZero` has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` <= `ol`, `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements in `suffZero`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. If `zr` > `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * the last element in preOne`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`. If `el` == '>', `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` has one fewer element (the last element has been removed), and `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` if `ol` <= `zr`; otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `2 * suffZero[-1] - (func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr))`. If `el` != '>', `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `ans[i]` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1` if `zr` <= `ol`; otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
