Output State: **`ans[i]` is assigned the value `zeroInd - 2 * func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`, all other variables remain unchanged.** 

This means that the value of `ans[i]` is updated to the result of the expression `zeroInd - 2 * func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`, while the values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `preOne`, `n`, and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The value of `oneInd` is still `2 * func_1(preOne, 1)`.
