Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `preOne[-1]` and `func_1(preOne, 1)` are not provided, so the expression for `oneInd` is left in terms of these values.
