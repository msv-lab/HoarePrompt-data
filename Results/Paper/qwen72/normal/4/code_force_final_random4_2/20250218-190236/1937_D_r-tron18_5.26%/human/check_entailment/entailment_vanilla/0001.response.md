### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell will move left or right based on the character in the cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each for placing the pinball on the i-th cell and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
     - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - This function is used to calculate the cumulative effect of movements and inversions.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes a string `s1` and an integer `n`.
     - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is a cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters from the end.
     - `ans` is the list to store the results for each query.
     - The function iterates from the end of the string to the beginning.
     - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and updates `preOne` and `totalOne`.
     - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time to leave the grid using the cumulative sums.
     - Finally, it prints the results for each query.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the time to leave the grid for each cell is based on the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters.
   - The function correctly handles the inversion of the characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The use of `accumulate` and the cumulative sums ensures that the time complexity is efficient, which is crucial given the constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle cases where the string is entirely '<' or '>'.
   - It should also handle the case where the string has a mix of '<' and '>'.
   - The program correctly handles these cases by using the cumulative sums and the logic to calculate the time to leave the grid.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the results for each query in a single line.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell using cumulative sums and handles the inversion of characters correctly.

Correctness: **True**
