### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n`.
   - Each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left if the cell contains '<' and right if the cell contains '>'.
   - After each move, the direction of the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each starting with a pinball on a different cell, and output the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Breaking Down the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
     - It calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - This function is used to compute the sum of elements in a prefix or suffix array.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function takes a string `s1` and an integer `n`.
     - It initializes a list `pre` with the indices of cells that contain '>'.
     - It calculates the total number of '>' cells (`totalOne`).
     - It creates a prefix sum array `preOne` for the indices of '>' cells.
     - It initializes a suffix sum array `suffZero` for the indices of '<' cells.
     - It initializes an answer array `ans` of length `n`.

3. **Processing Each Cell:**
   - The function iterates over the cells from right to left.
   - For each cell, it checks if the cell contains '>' or '<'.
   - If the cell contains '>', it updates the answer array `ans` based on the current state of `preOne` and `suffZero`.
   - If the cell contains '<', it updates the `suffZero` array and the answer array `ans` based on the current state of `preOne` and `suffZero`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The program correctly uses prefix and suffix sums to keep track of the positions of '>' and '<' cells.
   - The logic for updating the answer array `ans` is based on the number of '>' and '<' cells and their positions.
   - The function correctly handles the inversion of the cell direction after each move.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the grid is entirely composed of '<' or '>'.
   - It also handles the case where the grid has a mix of '<' and '>'.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the answer for each cell in the grid.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the program and the problem description, the logic and implementation appear to be correct. The use of prefix and suffix sums, along with the correct handling of cell inversions and movement, ensures that the program will correctly calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
