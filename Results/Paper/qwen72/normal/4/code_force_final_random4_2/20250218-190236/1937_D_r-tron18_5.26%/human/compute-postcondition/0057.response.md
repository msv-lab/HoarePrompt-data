Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), `oneInd` is 2 * the last element in `preOne`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation:
- `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1).
- `oneInd` is calculated as 2 * the last element in `preOne`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.
