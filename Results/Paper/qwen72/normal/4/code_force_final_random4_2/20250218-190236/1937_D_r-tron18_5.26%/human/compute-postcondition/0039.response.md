Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`**

Explanation:
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `el` remains the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`.
- `ol` remains `totalOne`.
- `zr` remains `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`. The exact value of `zeroInd` depends on the return value of `func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, but it is now twice that value.
