Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball according to the rules specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not simulate the pinball movement and the inversion of the characters correctly for each cell. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
>><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 4 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program does not produce the correct output for this input. The expected output is derived from the following movements:
- For the first cell (index 0): The pinball moves right to index 1, then left to index 0, and then left to leave the grid. This takes 3 seconds.
- For the second cell (index 1): The pinball moves right to index 2, then left to index 1, and then left to index 0, and finally left to leave the grid. This takes 4 seconds.
- For the third cell (index 2): The pinball moves left to index 1, and then left to index 0, and finally left to leave the grid. This takes 1 second.

The program's logic is too complex and does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters. Therefore, it is incorrect.
