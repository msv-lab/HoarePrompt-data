You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where 0 <= `times` <= len(arr)). It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-l, -1 - times)`, where `l` is the length of `arr`. This means it calculates the difference between the last element and an element near the end of the list, depending on the value of `times`. If `times` is 0, it returns the difference between the last element and itself (which is 0). If `times` is greater than 0, it returns the difference between the last element and the element `times` positions before the last element.

    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It processes the string and computes a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific calculation based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements updated, and this list is printed to the console.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball according to the rules specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not simulate the pinball movement and the inversion of the characters correctly for each cell. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
>><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 4 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program does not produce the correct output for this input. The expected output is derived from the following movements:
- For the first cell (index 0): The pinball moves right to index 1, then left to index 0, and then left to leave the grid. This takes 3 seconds.
- For the second cell (index 1): The pinball moves right to index 2, then left to index 1, and then left to index 0, and finally left to leave the grid. This takes 4 seconds.
- For the third cell (index 2): The pinball moves left to index 1, and then left to index 0, and finally left to leave the grid. This takes 1 second.

The program's logic is too complex and does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters. Therefore, it is incorrect.
