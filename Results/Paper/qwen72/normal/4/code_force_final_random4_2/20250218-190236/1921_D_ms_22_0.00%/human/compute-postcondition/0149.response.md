Output State: **`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.** 

The `heapq.heappop(max_heap)` operation removes the largest tuple from the `max_heap`, reducing the number of tuples in `max_heap` from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. The removed tuple is assigned to `item`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The conditions involving `item[2]`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
