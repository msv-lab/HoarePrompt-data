Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-2` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was previously in `max_heap`. `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
