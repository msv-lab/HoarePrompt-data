Output State: **`max_heap` contains `n` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element `i` in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (0 or `m - 1`). `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the `max_heap` will contain `n` tuples, where each tuple represents the maximum absolute difference between an element from the list `a` and either the first or the last element of the sorted list `b`. Each tuple also includes the element from `a` and the index of the element in `b` (either 0 or `m - 1`). The variables `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2` remain unchanged, and `t` is reduced by `n` (the number of elements in `a`), but it must still be greater than or equal to 0. The lists `a` and `b` and the integers `n` and `m` retain their initial values.
