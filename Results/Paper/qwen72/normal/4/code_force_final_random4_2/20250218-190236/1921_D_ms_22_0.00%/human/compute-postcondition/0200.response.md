Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, and the `index` of `item` (i.e., `item[2]`) is either less than `tp1` (0) or greater than `tp2` (`m - 1`), `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b` (i.e., `abs(item[1] - b[0])`), `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b` (i.e., `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`), and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**
