Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element `i` in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (0 or `m - 1`). `ans` is updated based on the condition: if `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is increased by the larger of `diff1` and `diff2` (where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`); if `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the negative of the first element of `item`. `tp1` and `tp2` are updated as follows: if `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is set to 1 if `diff1` > `diff2` and `tp2` remains `m - 1`, or `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is set to `m - 2` if `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`; if `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is set to 1 if `item[2]` is 0, otherwise `tp1` remains 0, and `tp2` is set to `m - 2` if `item[2]` is `m - 1`, otherwise `tp2` remains `m - 1`. `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0. `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and its index in `b` (i.e., `item[2]`) is either outside the range `[tp1, tp2]` or within the updated range `[tp1, tp2]` but not equal to the original `tp1` if the else part executed.**
