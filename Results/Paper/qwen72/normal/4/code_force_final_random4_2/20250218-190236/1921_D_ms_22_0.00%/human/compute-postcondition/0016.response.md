Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap with the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` added, and the current value of `diff1` is still greater than the current value of `diff2`.**
