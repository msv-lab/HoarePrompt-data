Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and either `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`. If `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` or `tp2` is adjusted based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1.***
