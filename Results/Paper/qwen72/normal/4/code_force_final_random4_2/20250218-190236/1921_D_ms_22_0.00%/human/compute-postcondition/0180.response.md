The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))` pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` into the `max_heap` list. Since `max_heap` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `max_heap` will contain the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. The values of `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 1 element, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the first element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element in `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element in `b`. The condition `diff1 <= diff2` holds.**
