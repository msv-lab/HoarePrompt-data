Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` and `m` are the values provided by the user input. `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module. `a` is a list of integers input by the user. `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, where the integers are the result of splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer. `max_heap` is an empty list. `tp1` is 0.**
