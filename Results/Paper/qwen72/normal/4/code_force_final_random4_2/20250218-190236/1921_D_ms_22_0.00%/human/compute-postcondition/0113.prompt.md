Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_heap` contains a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`. `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the first element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`max_heap` contains two tuples: if `diff1` > `diff2`, the tuples are `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, the tuples are `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`max_heap` contains three tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, the tuples are `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `(-diff1, i, 0)`, and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, the tuples are `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
