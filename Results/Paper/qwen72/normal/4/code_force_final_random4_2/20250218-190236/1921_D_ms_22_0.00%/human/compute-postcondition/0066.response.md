Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-2` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was removed from `max_heap`. If the third element of `item` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1` in `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `ans` is increased by `diff1` and `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `diff2` and `tp2` is decreased by 1. If the third element of `item` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive), `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1 and `item[2]` is equal to `tp1 + 1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
