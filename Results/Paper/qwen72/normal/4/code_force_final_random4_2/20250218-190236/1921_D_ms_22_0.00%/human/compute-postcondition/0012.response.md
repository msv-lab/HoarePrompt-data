To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty list. The state of `i` will be automatically managed by the loop, so we do not need to adjust it directly.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `max_heap` is an empty list.
- `tp1` is 0.
- `tp2` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is 0.

We need to ensure that `a` is non-empty for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `a` must have at least one element.

State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`**
