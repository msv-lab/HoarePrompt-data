Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0.** 

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
