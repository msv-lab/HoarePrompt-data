The loop head contains only the variable `max_heap`. The loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` now contains `n-2` tuples. For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple.

State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
