Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop, and `tp1` and `tp2` have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`max_heap` is empty:** The loop continues to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. After all iterations, `max_heap` will be empty because each iteration removes one tuple from it.
- **`ans` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop:** The variable `ans` accumulates the absolute differences based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, it increases by either `diff1` or `diff2` when `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, or by the negative of `item[0]` when `item[2]` is within this range.
- **`tp1` and `tp2` have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop:** The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted within the loop to move towards the center of the list `b`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `tp1` is incremented or `tp2` is decremented accordingly. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is incremented if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, and `tp2` is decremented otherwise. This process continues until `max_heap` is empty.

The state of the other variables (`a`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`) remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
