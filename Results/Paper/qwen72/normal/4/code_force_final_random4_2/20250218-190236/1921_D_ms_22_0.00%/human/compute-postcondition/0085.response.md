Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `t`. The variables `n` and `m` are now assigned the values provided by the user as integers.
