Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and the current value of `diff1` is greater than the current value of `diff2`.**
