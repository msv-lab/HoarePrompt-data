Postcondition: ***`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
