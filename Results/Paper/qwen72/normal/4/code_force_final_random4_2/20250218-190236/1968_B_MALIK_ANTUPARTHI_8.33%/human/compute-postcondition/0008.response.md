Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `j` is 0, and the element `d[j]` is present in the slice `e[k-1:]`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is assigned the value `e.index(d[j]) + 1`.
- `e.index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the list `e`.
- Since `j` is 0, `d[j]` is the first element of `d`.
- `k` is therefore the index of the first occurrence of `d[0]` in `e` plus 1.
- The element `d[j]` is still present in the slice `e[k-1:]` because `k-1` is the index where `d[j]` was found.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
