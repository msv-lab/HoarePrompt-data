The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state provided does not ensure that `b` is greater than 0, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer input and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0, `j` is 0**
