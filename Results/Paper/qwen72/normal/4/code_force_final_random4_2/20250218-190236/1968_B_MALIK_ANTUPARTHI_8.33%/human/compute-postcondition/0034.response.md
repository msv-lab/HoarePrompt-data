To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is an integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `d` is an input value.
   - `e` is an input value.
   - `j` is `b` or the index where the loop was broken.
   - `k` is the index of the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `n` and `m` are the sizes of some lists or arrays.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with specific constraints.
   - `d` and `e` are input values, which could be lists or arrays.
   - `j` is determined by the value of `b` or the index where a loop was broken.
   - `k` is the index of the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` depends on the value of `j`.
   - `j` is either `b` or the index where a loop was broken.
   - If `j` is `b`, then `k` is the index of the last occurrence of `d[b]` in `e` plus 1.
   - If the loop was broken at some index `x`, then `k` is `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.
   - Since the exact values of `d` and `e` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`.
   - However, based on the given conditions, `k` will be either the index of the last occurrence of `d[b]` in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.

Output: **k (where k is the index of the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken, and `j` is either `b` or the index where the loop was broken)**
