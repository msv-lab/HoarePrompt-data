Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 2, `k` is set to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and `k` == `c` or `j` == `b - 1`, `k` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
