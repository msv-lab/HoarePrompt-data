Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is `b` or the index where the loop was broken, `k` is 0, `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 0, and `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `e.index(d[0]) + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 0, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 1, and `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[0]) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 0, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 2, and `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[0]) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to 3 if `k` == `c` or `j` == `b` - 1, otherwise `k` remains 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
