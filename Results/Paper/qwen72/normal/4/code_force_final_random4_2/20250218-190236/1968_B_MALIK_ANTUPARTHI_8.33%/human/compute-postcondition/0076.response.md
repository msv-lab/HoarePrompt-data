The code snippet `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` updates the value of `k` based on the index of the character at position `j` in string `d` within string `e`, and then increments this index by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is an integer greater than 1
- `b` is an integer greater than 0
- `c` is an integer
- `i` is 2
- The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `d` is an input string
- `e` is an input string
- `j` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input
- The character at index `j` (which is 0) in string `d` is present in the substring of string `e` starting from index `k` (which is 0)

The character at index `j` (which is 0) in string `d` is present in the substring of string `e` starting from index `k` (which is 0). Therefore, `e.index(d[j])` will return the index of the first occurrence of `d[0]` in `e`. Adding 1 to this index will give the new value of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 0, `k` is `e.index(d[0]) + 1`, `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input.**
