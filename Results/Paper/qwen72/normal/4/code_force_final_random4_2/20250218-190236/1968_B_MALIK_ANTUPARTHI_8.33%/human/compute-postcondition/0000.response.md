Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is an integer input, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

The value of `a` has been updated to an integer input, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
