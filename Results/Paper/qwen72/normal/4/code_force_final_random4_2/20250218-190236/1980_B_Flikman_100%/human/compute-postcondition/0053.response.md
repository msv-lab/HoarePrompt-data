Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is the number of iterations the loop will run, `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`. If `removed_count` is 0, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not 0.***
