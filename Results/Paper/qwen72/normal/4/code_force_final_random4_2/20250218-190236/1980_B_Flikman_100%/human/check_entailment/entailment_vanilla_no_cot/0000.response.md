Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, in no cases, or maybe. The issue lies in how it counts the number of times the favorite cube's value is removed. Specifically, the program checks if the favorite value is among the first `k` cubes after sorting and counts how many times it appears in those `k` cubes. However, it does not correctly account for the possibility that the favorite cube itself might be among those `k` cubes, or if it is not, whether it could be in a position that is not removed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        # Find the position of the favorite cube after sorting
        favorite_position = sorted_a.index(favorite_value)
        
        # Determine the outcome based on the position of the favorite cube
        if favorite_position < k:
            print('YES')
        elif favorite_position >= k and sorted_a[k-1] == favorite_value:
            print('MAYBE')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.
2. **Finding the Favorite Cube's Position**: The position of the favorite cube's value in the sorted array is found using `sorted_a.index(favorite_value)`.
3. **Determining the Outcome**:
   - If the favorite cube's position is less than `k`, it will definitely be removed, so the output is "YES".
   - If the favorite cube's position is greater than or equal to `k` but the value at the `k-1` position in the sorted array is the same as the favorite cube's value, it means there are multiple cubes with the same value, and the favorite cube might be removed or not, so the output is "MAYBE".
   - If the favorite cube's position is greater than or equal to `k` and the value at the `k-1` position is not the same as the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube will not be removed, so the output is "NO".

This corrected version should handle all the cases described in the problem correctly.
