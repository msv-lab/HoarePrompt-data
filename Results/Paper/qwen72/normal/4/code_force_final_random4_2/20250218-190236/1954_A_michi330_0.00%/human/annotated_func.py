#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The function should be able to process these inputs and determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `itest` is `t`, and for each test case from 0 to `t-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` were input integers. For each test case, if `n` was less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` was less than `k`, the output was 'NO'. Otherwise, the output was 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. It then checks if Alice can paint a ribbon of length `n` in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts of the ribbon have the same color by using at most `k` colors and dividing the ribbon into `m` parts. If the condition `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed and the appropriate 'Yes' or 'NO' responses have been printed for each.
