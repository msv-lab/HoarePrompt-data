The only objects in the loop head are the variables `itest` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `itest` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `itest` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `itest` must be incremented by 1, so `itest` becomes 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `itest` is less than `t`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `itest` is 2, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the condition is true. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
