You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The function should be able to process these inputs and determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `itest` is `t`, and for each test case from 0 to `t-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` were input integers. For each test case, if `n` was less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` was less than `k`, the output was 'NO'. Otherwise, the output was 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 50), and returns a boolean value indicating whether Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
