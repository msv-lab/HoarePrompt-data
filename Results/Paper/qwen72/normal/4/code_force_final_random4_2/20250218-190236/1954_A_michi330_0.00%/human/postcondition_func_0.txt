The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. It then checks if Alice can paint a ribbon of length `n` in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts of the ribbon have the same color by using at most `k` colors and dividing the ribbon into `m` parts. If the condition `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed and the appropriate 'Yes' or 'NO' responses have been printed for each.
