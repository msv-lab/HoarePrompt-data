Output State: **The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which represents the number of test cases.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of an integer input to the variable `t`.
- The variable `t` now holds the number of test cases that the function `func` will process.
- The initial state information about the function `func` and the constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k` remains unchanged.
