You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The function should be able to process these inputs and determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `itest` is `t`, and for each test case from 0 to `t-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` were input integers. For each test case, if `n` was less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` was less than `k`, the output was 'NO'. Otherwise, the output was 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. It then checks if Alice can paint a ribbon of length `n` in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts of the ribbon have the same color by using at most `k` colors and dividing the ribbon into `m` parts. If the condition `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed and the appropriate 'Yes' or 'NO' responses have been printed for each.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Succeed:**
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to a single color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that will have the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Succeed:**
   - If `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `1 1 1`
     - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is true, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 2:** `5 1 1`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < 1`, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 3:** `5 2 1`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 >= 1`, so the output should be 'Yes'.
   - **Test Case 4:** `5 2 2`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 < 2`, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 5:** `5 5 3`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 >= 3`, so the output should be 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and the output match the problem description and the provided examples.
