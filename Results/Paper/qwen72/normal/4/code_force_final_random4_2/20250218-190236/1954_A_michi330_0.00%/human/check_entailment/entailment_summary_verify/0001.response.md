### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Succeed:**
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to a single color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that will have the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Succeed:**
   - If `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `1 1 1`
     - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is true, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 2:** `5 1 1`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < 1`, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 3:** `5 2 1`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 >= 1`, so the output should be 'Yes'.
   - **Test Case 4:** `5 2 2`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 < 2`, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 5:** `5 5 3`
     - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 >= 3`, so the output should be 'Yes'.

### Challenging the Original Assessment:

The original assessment is generally correct, but there is a subtle issue in the logic. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is not entirely accurate for determining if Bob can make all parts the same color. Specifically, the condition should be `n - (n // m) * m < k` to correctly account for the distribution of colors.

### Corrected Condition:
- If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to a single color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
- If `n - (n // m) * m < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - (n // m) * m < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
```

### Verification with Corrected Condition:
- **Test Case 1:** `1 1 1`
  - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is true, so the output should be 'NO'.
- **Test Case 2:** `5 1 1`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
  - `n - (n // m) * m = 5 - 5 * 1 = 0 < 1`, so the output should be 'NO'.
- **Test Case 3:** `5 2 1`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
  - `n - (n // m) * m = 5 - 2 * 2 = 1 >= 1`, so the output should be 'Yes'.
- **Test Case 4:** `5 2 2`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `n - (n // m) * m = 5 - 2 * 2 = 1 < 2`, so the output should be 'NO'.
- **Test Case 5:** `5 5 3`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
  - `n - (n // m) * m = 5 - 1 * 5 = 0 < 3`, so the output should be 'NO'.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate for the given test cases, but the logic in the code is not entirely correct. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` should be replaced with `n - (n // m) * m < k` to accurately determine if Bob can make all parts the same color.

Final: **False**
