Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `itest` is 1.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
   - The condition is defined as follows:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the condition is true.
     - Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions that determine whether a certain condition is true or false, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement will always print `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
