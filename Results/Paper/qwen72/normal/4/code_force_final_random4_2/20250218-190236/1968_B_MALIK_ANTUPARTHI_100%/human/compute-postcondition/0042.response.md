Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]`, plus 1, plus the original value of `k`.
- Since `j` is 0, `d[j]` is the first element of `d`.
- The slice `e[k:]` starts from the element at index `k` in `e` to the end of `e`.
- The `index` method returns the first index where `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`.
- Adding 1 to this index and then adding the original value of `k` gives the new value of `k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
