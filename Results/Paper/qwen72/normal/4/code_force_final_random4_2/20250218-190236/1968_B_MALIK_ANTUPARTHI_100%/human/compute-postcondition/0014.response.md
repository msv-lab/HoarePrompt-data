Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, and `d[j]` is not in the slice `e[k:]`**

Explanation:
- The code `k = j` assigns the value of `j` to `k`.
- Since `j` is 0, `k` is also set to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
