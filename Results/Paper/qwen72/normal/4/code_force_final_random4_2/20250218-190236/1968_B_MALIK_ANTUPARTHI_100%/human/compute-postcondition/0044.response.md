Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 0, `k` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 0, `k` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
