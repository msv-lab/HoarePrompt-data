Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `i` is `a - 1`, `b` is the last input integer, `c` is the last input integer, `d` is the last input value, `e` is the last input value, `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the index of the last element in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index at which the loop breaks if no such element is found, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`n` and `m`**: Remain integers within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- **`a`**: The input integer that determines the number of iterations of the outer loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes all iterations, `i` will be `a - 1` because the loop runs from 0 to `a - 1`.
- **`b` and `c`**: These are the last input integers provided during the final iteration of the outer loop.
- **`d` and `e`**: These are the last input values provided during the final iteration of the outer loop.
- **`j`**: This is the index at which the inner loop breaks, or it will be `b` if the inner loop completes without breaking.
- **`k`**: This is the index of the last element in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index at which the inner loop breaks if no such element is found.
- **Sum of `n` and `m` values**: The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, as specified in the initial state.
