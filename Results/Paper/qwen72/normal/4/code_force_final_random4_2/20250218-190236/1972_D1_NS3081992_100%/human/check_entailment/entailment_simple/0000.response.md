### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_10()` is used to read the number of test cases `t` from the standard input. This is correct as it reads an integer and is used in a loop to handle multiple test cases.
   - The function `func_7()` is used within `func_15()` to read two integers `n` and `m` for each test case. This is also correct as it reads a line of space-separated integers and converts them into a list of integers.

2. **Logic of `func_15()`**:
   - The function `func_15()` is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`. This is a key part of the logic.
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is implicitly handled by the loop and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)`. However, this needs to be verified to ensure it correctly counts the valid pairs.

3. **Correctness of the Loop**:
   - The loop in `func_15()` is designed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` is used to count the number of valid pairs for a given `i`. This expression is derived from the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, which simplifies to `a + b` being a multiple of `b` when `gcd(a, b) = 1`.
   - The loop correctly increments `i` and updates `ans` with the number of valid pairs for each `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_15()` returns `ans - 1` to account for the initial value of `ans` being 0 and the first valid pair being counted.
   - The function `func_16()` correctly prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `n = 1` and `m = 1` correctly, as seen in the example where the first test case `(1, 1)` returns `1`.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as seen in the example test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. The input handling, loop logic, and output are all consistent with the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
