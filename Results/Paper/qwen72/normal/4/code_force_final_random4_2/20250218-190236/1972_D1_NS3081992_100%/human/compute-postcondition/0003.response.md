The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the console. The function `func_15()` is called, and its return value is printed. The initial state specifies that `func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than 1, but this function is not called in the given code snippet, so its state remains unchanged. The placeholder `_` is also not affected.

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, and the value of `func_15()` is printed to the console.**
