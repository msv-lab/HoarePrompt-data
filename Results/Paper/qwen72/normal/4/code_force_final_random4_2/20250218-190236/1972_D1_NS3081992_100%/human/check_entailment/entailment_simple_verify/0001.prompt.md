You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can rewrite the condition as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a + b = b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \cdot k
     \]
     \[
     a = b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
   - This implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_15():**
     - This function is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
     - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and checks the condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
     - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) to the answer.
     - Finally, it returns \(ans - 1\).

4. **Correctness of func_15():**
   - The condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) ensures that \(i\) is a valid candidate for \(b\).
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).
   - However, the function returns \(ans - 1\), which seems incorrect because it subtracts 1 from the total count without a clear reason.

5. **Function 16:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_15()` for each test case.
   - It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output.

6. **Overall Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_15()`.
   - The main logic is in `func_15()`, which is responsible for counting the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
- The logic in `func_15()` is almost correct, but the subtraction of 1 at the end is not justified by the problem statement. This could lead to incorrect results for some test cases.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect due to this issue.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
