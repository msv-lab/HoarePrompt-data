The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`.

- `d` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers.
- `processing` is a list of integers of length at least `max(da, max(d[da]))`, where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `da` is a positive integer.
- `rank` is a list of integers of length at least `da`.

The function returns:
- **Case_1**: The function returns 1.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the updated value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial `tmp` and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, a positive integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 in one case, and in another case, it returns the updated value of `rank[da - 1]` which is `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial `tmp` and the results of recursive calls to `func_12` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.**
