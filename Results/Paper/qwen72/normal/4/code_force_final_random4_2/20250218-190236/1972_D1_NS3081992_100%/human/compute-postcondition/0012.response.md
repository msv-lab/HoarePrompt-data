Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and their values are updated to the return values of `func_7()`. `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`. `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the smallest integer `k` such that `k * k > n + k` or `k > m`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `i` will be the smallest integer greater than 1 that either exceeds `m` or satisfies the condition `i * i > n + i`. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of the integer divisions `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all values of `i` from 1 up to the point where the loop condition is no longer met.
