Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function does not take any parameters.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `processing` will have its elements at positions `di - 1` (for each `di` in `d[da]`) temporarily set to 1 and then reset to 0. The value of `tmp` will be the minimum value between the initial `tmp` and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The values of `d`, `rank`, and `da` remain unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the updated value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial `tmp` and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers (each element is either 0 or 1), a positive integer `da`, and a list `rank` of integers. If the list `d[da]` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over each element in `d[da]`, and for each element `di` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, it sets `processing[di - 1]` to 1, recursively calls `func_12` with updated parameters, and then resets `processing[di - 1]` to 0. The function updates `rank[da - 1]` to be 1 more than the minimum value returned by these recursive calls. Finally, the function returns the updated value of `rank[da - 1]`.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing the values `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` with constraints 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m. It returns a tuple of three values: the first value is the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `a` and `b`, and the second and third values are coefficients `x` and `y` such that `a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively computes the GCD and the coefficients.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is a non-negative integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):

    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is `n-1`. If any element `a[j]` (where 0 <= j < n) is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k` minus (`m` - `a[j]`). Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is `n-1`. If any element `a[j]` (where 0 <= j < n) is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k` minus (`m` - `a[j]`). Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and a non-negative integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference (`m` - `a[i]`). After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the integers `n` and `m`. The final state of the program includes the updated value of `k` and the return value of either 1 or -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1

    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and their values are updated to the return values of `func_7()`. `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`. `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the smallest integer `k` such that `k * k > n + k` or `k > m`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the smallest integer `k` such that `k * k > n + k` or `k > m`, and `n` and `m` are positive integers updated to the return values of `func_7()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It updates the values of `n` and `m` to the return values of `func_7()`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function then calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the smallest integer `k` such that `k * k > n + k` or `k > m`. Finally, it returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the calculated sum.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are directly used in the function signature. However, the function `func_16` relies on the outputs of `func_10` and `func_15`, where `func_10` should return a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases, and `func_15` should return an integer representing the number of valid pairs for each test case.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: `func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and the value of `func_15()` is printed to the console for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by `func_10`. For each iteration, it prints the integer returned by `func_15` to the console, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the number of valid pairs for each test case (as determined by `func_15`) has been printed to the console, and the program state is unchanged except for the side effect of the console output.
