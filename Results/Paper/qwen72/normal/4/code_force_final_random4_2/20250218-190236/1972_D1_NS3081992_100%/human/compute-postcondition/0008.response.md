Functionality: ** The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by `func_10`. For each iteration, it prints the integer returned by `func_15` to the console, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the number of valid pairs for each test case (as determined by `func_15`) has been printed to the console, and the program state is unchanged except for the side effect of the console output. **
