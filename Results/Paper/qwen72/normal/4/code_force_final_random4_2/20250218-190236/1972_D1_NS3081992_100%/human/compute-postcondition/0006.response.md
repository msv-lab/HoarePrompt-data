Output State: **`func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and the value of `func_15()` is printed to the console for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `func_10()` must have returned a non-negative integer that is at least as large as the number of times the loop executed. For each iteration of the loop, the value returned by `func_15()` was printed to the console. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted and remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
