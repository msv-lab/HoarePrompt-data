Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is 3, `ans` is (n + 1) // 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9, `m` must be at least 3, and `n` must be at least 6**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `(n + 3) // 9`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
