### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Current Implementation in `func_15`**:
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and checks the condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - It then calculates \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) and adds this to the answer.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Issues with `func_15`**:
   - The condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) does not reflect the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The calculation \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) is not related to the problem's requirement either.
   - The function does not correctly handle the pairs \((a, b)\) and their gcd conditions.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_15` does not correctly count these pairs. It would iterate over \(i\) from 1 to 3 and perform the incorrect calculations, leading to an incorrect result.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done using nested loops, but for efficiency, we can use a more optimized approach by considering the properties of gcd and the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
