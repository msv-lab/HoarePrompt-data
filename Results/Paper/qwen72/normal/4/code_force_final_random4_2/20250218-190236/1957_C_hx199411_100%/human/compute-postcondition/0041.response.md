Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. The loop has finished executing.
2. `t` is now `t - 1` (though `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
3. `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input.
4. Each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid.
5. `i` is `m`.
6. `c` and `r` are integers provided by user input.
7. `m` is the value calculated based on the conditions given.
8. `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers where:
   - `dp[1]` is 1
   - `dp[2]` is 3
   - `dp[3]` is 8
   - `dp[4]` is 26
   - `dp[5]` is 110
   - The subsequent values up to `dp[m]` are calculated using the formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(dp[m])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `dp` List:**
   - The list `dp` is initialized with specific values for the first 5 elements.
   - For `i` from 6 to `m`, the values are calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

2. **Value of `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated based on some conditions, but the exact conditions are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe `m` as an integer value that is determined by the user input and the conditions given.

3. **Value of `dp[m]`:**
   - The value of `dp[m]` depends on the value of `m`.
   - If `m` is 1, `dp[m]` is 1.
   - If `m` is 2, `dp[m]` is 3.
   - If `m` is 3, `dp[m]` is 8.
   - If `m` is 4, `dp[m]` is 26.
   - If `m` is 5, `dp[m]` is 110.
   - For `m` greater than 5, `dp[m]` is calculated using the given formula.

### Final Output:
The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is the `m`-th element of the list `dp` calculated using the provided formula. Since the exact value of `m` is not given, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the m-th element of the list dp, calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for i from 6 to m`)**
