Let's break down the initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `c` and `r` are integers provided by user input.
   - `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input.
   - Each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid.
   - `i` is `m`.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations.
   - `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3.
   - `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1.
   - `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `dp[2]` is 3.
   - `dp[3]` is 7.
   - `dp[4]` is 17.
   - `dp[5]` is 73.
   - For each `i` from 6 to `m`, `dp[i]` is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

2. **Python Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(dp[m])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The list `dp` is initialized with `m + 1` zeros.
   - The first five elements of `dp` are explicitly set to 1, 3, 7, 17, and 73 respectively.
   - For `i` from 6 to `m`, the elements of `dp` are computed using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

4. **Determine the Value of `dp[m]`:**
   - The value of `dp[m]` depends on the value of `m`.
   - Since `m` is at least 3, and the first five elements of `dp` are explicitly given, we need to compute the value of `dp[m]` if `m` is greater than 5.
   - If `m` is 6 or greater, the value of `dp[m]` is computed using the given formula.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`.
   - If `m` is 5 or less, the value of `dp[m]` is one of the explicitly given values: 1, 3, 7, 17, or 73.
   - If `m` is greater than 5, the value of `dp[m]` is computed using the formula.

Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `dp[m]` as described.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value at index m in the list dp, computed using the given formula if m is greater than 5, or one of the explicitly given values 1, 3, 7, 17, or 73 if m is 5 or less)**
