Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
2. `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input.
4. `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
5. `i` is `k - 1`.
6. `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`.
7. `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 5.
8. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
9. `dp[1]` is 1.
10. `dp[2]` is 3.
11. `dp[3]` is 5.
12. `dp[4]` is 31.
13. `dp[5]` is 63.
14. `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is computed as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(dp[m])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input and Initial Conditions:**
   - `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user.
   - `t` is adjusted to `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Calculate `i` and `num`:**
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 5.

4. **Initialize `dp` List:**
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `dp[2]` is 3.
   - `dp[3]` is 5.
   - `dp[4]` is 31.
   - `dp[5]` is 63.
   - For `i` from 6 to `m`, `dp[i]` is computed as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.

5. **Determine the Value of `dp[m]`:**
   - The value of `dp[m]` depends on the computed values of `dp` from 6 to `m` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c`, `r`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, based on the given conditions and the formula, the print statement will output the value of `dp[m]` which is computed using the provided formula and must be a single digit (0-9) due to the modulo 10 operation.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value of the m-th element in the dp list, computed as (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % 10, and m is n - num, with num being the total number of times c was equal to r plus twice the number of times c was not equal to r)**
