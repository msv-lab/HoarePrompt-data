Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is 2, `m` is `n - 2`, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

The value of `num` is incremented by 2, and `m` is updated to `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
