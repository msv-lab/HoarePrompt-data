The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `i` is `k-1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. The values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the new integers provided by the user input.**
