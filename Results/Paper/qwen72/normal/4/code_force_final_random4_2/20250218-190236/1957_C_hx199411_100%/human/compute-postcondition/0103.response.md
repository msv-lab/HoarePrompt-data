Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is either 2 or 3, and `m` is `n - 1`. If `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is either 3 or 4, and `m` is `n - 2`.**

The values of `c` and `r` are now updated based on the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, and `m`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
