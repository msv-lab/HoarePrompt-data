Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid; `num` is 0.**

The value of `num` is set to 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and the moves represented by `r_i` and `c_i` remain unchanged.
