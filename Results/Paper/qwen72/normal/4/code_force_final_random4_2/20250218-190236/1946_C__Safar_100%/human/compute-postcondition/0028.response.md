Postcondition: ***A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), `visited` is a set containing the value 1, `x` is 1, `p` is 1. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to A, `r` is 1. If `d[x]` is less than A, `r` is 0 and `d[x]` is updated to 2. If `x` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
