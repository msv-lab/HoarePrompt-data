Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from user input. It calculates the number of screens required to accommodate `x` units of space and `y` units of space, where each unit of `y` requires 4 cells and each screen can hold up to 15 cells. If the space required for `x` can be accommodated within the remaining cells after placing `y`, it appends the number of screens required for `y` to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining `x` space and appends the total number of screens to the result list. Finally, it prints each element of the result list on a new line. **
