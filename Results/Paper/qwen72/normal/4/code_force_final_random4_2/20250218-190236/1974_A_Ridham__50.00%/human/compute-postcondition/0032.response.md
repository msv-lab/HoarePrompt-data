The code snippet updates the value of `remaining_cells` based on the current values of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`. Let's break down the impact:

- `remaining_cells` is recalculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, `result` is a list that includes the new value of `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or a list that now contains the new value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.**
