Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, and `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`.**
