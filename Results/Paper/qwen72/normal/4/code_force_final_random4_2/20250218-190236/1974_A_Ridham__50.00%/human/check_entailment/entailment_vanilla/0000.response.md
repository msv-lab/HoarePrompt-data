### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of 1x1 icons `x` and 2x2 icons `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The total space required for 1x1 icons is `space_x = x * 1`.
   - The total space required for 2x2 icons is `space_y = y * 4`.
   - The combined total space required is `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The function calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (as 2 * 4 = 8 cells, and a screen has 15 cells), the calculation is:
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Check if 1x1 Icons Fit in Remaining Cells:**
   - If the space required for 1x1 icons `space_x` is less than or equal to the remaining cells `remaining_cells`, then the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`, the function calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
     - If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen = space_x // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
  - The calculation for the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, so the formula `y // 2` for even `y` and `y // 2 + 1` for odd `y` is accurate.

- **Correctness of Remaining Cells Calculation:**
  - The calculation for the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons is correct. The formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` correctly determines the number of cells left on the screens used for 2x2 icons.

- **Correctness of 1x1 Icons Placement:**
  - The function correctly checks if the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells. If they can, it uses the same number of screens. If they cannot, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

- **Output:**
  - The function correctly appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results for all test cases.
