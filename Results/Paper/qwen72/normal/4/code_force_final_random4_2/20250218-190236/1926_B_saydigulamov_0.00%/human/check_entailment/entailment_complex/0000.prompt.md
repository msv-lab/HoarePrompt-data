Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters (either '0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: `a` is 0, `i` is `a` (which is 0), `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters for each input string `b` that contains at least one '1' from all iterations, and the length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1' across all iterations. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then this relationship holds true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and then reads `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It counts the number of '1' characters in each string that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. If the first and second elements of `k` are equal, it prints the list `k`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `a` is 0, `i` is `a` (which is 0), and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1' characters for each input string that contained at least one '1' across all iterations.
