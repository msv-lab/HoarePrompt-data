Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters for each input string that contains at least one '1', and `int(input())` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The variable `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: The list `k` will contain an integer for each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. Each integer in the list represents the number of '1' characters in the corresponding input string.
- **`int(input())`**: This value determines the number of times the loop will execute. After all iterations, this value will be the total number of times the loop has run.

### Example:
If the user inputs `5` for `int(input())` and the following strings for `b`:
- "1010"
- "0000"
- "1111"
- "0000"
- "1000"

The final state of `k` will be `[2, 4, 1]` because:
- "1010" contains 2 '1's.
- "0000" contains no '1's, so nothing is appended.
- "1111" contains 4 '1's.
- "0000" contains no '1's, so nothing is appended.
- "1000" contains 1 '1'.
