Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer minus 1, `s` is the fourth input integer minus 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `t` must be greater than `n + 1`, `bm` is now equal to `a[b] * k`, `sm` is now equal to `a[s] * k`, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `sm = a[s] * k` updates the value of `sm` to be the product of the element at index `s` in the list `a` and the integer `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
