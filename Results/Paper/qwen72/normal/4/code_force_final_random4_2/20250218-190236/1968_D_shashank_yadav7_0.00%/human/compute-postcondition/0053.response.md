Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[s] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[s]`, `bp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[b] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[b]`, `bm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `bm` and `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `sm` and `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` for each iteration. If `k` reaches 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are reassigned the values from the input.
- The initial state of `t` remains unchanged.
- The initial state of `i` is still `n`, but `n` is now the new input value.
- The initial state of `k` is now the new input value.
- The initial state of `b` is now the new input value.
- The initial state of `s` is now the new input value.
- The initial state of `p` and `a` remains unchanged.
- The initial state of `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remains unchanged, but their calculations will now use the new values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
- The conditions for `bm` and `sm` remain the same, but they will be evaluated with the new values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
