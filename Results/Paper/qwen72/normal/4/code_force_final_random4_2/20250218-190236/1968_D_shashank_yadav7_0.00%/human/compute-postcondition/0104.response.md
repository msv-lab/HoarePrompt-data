The provided code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. This operation updates the values of these variables, but the other variables mentioned in the initial state (`i`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `t`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `s` is the fourth input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `t` must be greater than `n + 1`, `bm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial value of `sp` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the initial value of `bp` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.**
