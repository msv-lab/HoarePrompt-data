Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[b] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[b]`, `bm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `bm` and `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `sm` and `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` for each iteration. If `k` reaches 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
