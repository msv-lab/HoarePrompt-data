Let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is `k - n`, where `k` is an input integer.
- `b` is the result of `n` applications of the function `p[b] - 1`, where `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `s` is the result of `n` applications of the function `p[s] - 1`, where `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `sp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[s] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[s]`.
- `bp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[b] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[b]`.
- `bm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `bm` and `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `sm` and `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` for each iteration.
- If `k` reaches 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks.
- Additionally, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Draw'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, or `sm`.

### Output:
Output: **Draw**
