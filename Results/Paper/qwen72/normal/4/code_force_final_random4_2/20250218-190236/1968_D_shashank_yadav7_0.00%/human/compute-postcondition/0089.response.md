Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, then further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sm` is further updated to the maximum of its new value and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

In natural language:
- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `k` is decreased by 1.
- `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- `bm` is first updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, and then further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `sm` is first updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, and then further updated to the maximum of its new value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
- `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.
- `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.
- If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
