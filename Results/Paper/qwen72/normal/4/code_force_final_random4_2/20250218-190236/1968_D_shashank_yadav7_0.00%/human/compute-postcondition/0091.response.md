Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, then further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sm` is further updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. `sp` is now `sp + a[s]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The value of `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, making `sp` equal to `sp + a[s]`. All other initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged, except for the updated value of `sp`. If `k` is 0, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
