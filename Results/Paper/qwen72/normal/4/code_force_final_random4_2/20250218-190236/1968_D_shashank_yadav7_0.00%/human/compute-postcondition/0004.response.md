Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple parts based on spaces, converts each part into an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
