Output State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 2, `b` is now `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is now `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is now `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is now `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is now `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is now `bp + a[b] + a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
