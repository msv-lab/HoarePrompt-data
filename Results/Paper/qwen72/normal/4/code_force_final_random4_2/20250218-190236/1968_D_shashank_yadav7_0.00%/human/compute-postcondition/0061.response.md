Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is now equal to `a[b] * k`, `sm` is now equal to `a[s] * k`.** 

The value of `sm` is updated to be the product of the element at index `s` in the list `a` and the input integer `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
