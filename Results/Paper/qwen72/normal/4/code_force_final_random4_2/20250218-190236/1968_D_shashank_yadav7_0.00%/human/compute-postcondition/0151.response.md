To determine what will be printed when the `print('Draw')` statement executes, we need to understand the context and the state of the program based on the initial conditions provided.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is the first input integer.
2. `i` is `n - 1`.
3. `k` is the second input integer minus `n`.
4. `b` and `s` are values derived from the list `p` after `n` iterations, where each iteration involves complex indexing operations.
5. `bm` is the initial value of `a[b] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
6. `sm` is the initial value of `a[s] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
7. `sp` is the initial value of `a[s]` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
8. `bp` is the initial value of `a[b]` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
9. If `k` becomes 0 at any point during the iterations, the loop breaks.
10. `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('Draw')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'Draw'.
- The initial state and the complex operations described do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the variables and their values.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Draw')` statement will print the string 'Draw' regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`.

Output: **Draw**
