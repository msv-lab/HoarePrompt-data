You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed. Specifically, the logic for handling gaps between chosen vertices is incorrect. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Triangle Counting**:
   - The program initializes `ans` with `x - 2`, which is the number of triangles that can be formed with the `x` chosen vertices. This is correct because any set of `x` vertices in a polygon can form `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with diagonals.

2. **Handling Gaps**:
   - The program calculates gaps between the chosen vertices and sorts them. This is a good approach to identify the largest gaps where additional vertices can be added.
   - However, the logic for adding vertices to these gaps is flawed. The program uses the formula `pairs = gap // 2` to determine how many pairs of vertices can be added, and then adds `2 * y` to `ans` if `y` is less than `pairs`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the actual number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices.

3. **Incorrect Triangle Calculation**:
   - When adding vertices to a gap, the number of triangles that can be formed is not simply `2 * y`. The correct number of triangles that can be formed by adding `y` vertices to a gap of size `gap` is more complex and depends on the specific positions of the vertices.

4. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     8 4 2
     1 6 2 5
     ```
     The program should output `6` because the vertices `1, 6, 2, 5` can form 4 triangles, and by adding 2 more vertices, we can form 2 more triangles, making a total of 6 triangles.
     - However, the program's logic for handling gaps and adding vertices does not correctly account for the number of triangles that can be formed, leading to an incorrect output.

To correct the program, a more detailed and accurate approach to handling gaps and calculating the number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices is needed. The current logic is too simplistic and does not handle all potential cases correctly.
