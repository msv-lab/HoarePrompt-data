The function `max_triangular_pieces` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, representing the number of sides of the polygon.
- `x`: an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `y`: an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.
- `chosen_vertices`: a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The function returns the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from the polygon, given the vertices Bessie has already chosen.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. It returns the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a polygon with `n` sides, given the vertices Bessie has already chosen.**
