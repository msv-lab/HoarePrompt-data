Postcondition: ***`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is equal to '>', `prev` is 3. If `r` is equal to '=', and `r2` is the new input string, then if `r2` is equal to '<', `prev` is 3. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.***
