Output State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0.**

The variable `g` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`R`, `kp`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
