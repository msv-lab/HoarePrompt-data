Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
