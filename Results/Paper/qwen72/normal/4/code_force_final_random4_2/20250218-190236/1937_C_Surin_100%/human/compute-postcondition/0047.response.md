Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
   - If `r` is '=', and `r2` is '<', `prev` is also set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop. Since the exact value of `v1` is not provided, we can only describe it as the largest integer `i` for which `r` was '<'.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `v1` is used again in the print statement, so it remains the same as described above.
   - `prev` is determined by the conditions:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
     - If `r` is '=', and `r2` is '<', `prev` is also set to 1.
     - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.
   - `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which `r` was '<'.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v1` is used again, so it is the same as the first `v1`.
   - `prev` is either 0 or 1 based on the conditions described.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest integer i for which r was '<' during the loop, and prev is 0 or 1 based on the conditions described)**
