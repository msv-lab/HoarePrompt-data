Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `r` is equal to '='.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - The f-string will substitute the values of `i` and `prev` into the string.
   - `i` is 1, so `{i}` will be replaced with `1`.
   - `prev` is 0, so `{prev}` will be replaced with `0`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The string `'? 1 1 0 0'` will be printed.

Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
