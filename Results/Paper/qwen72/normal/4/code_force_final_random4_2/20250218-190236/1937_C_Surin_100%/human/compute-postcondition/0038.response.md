Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `r` is equal to '='.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Values of Variables:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Formatted String:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `i` and `prev`.
   - The string will be `'? 1 1 0 0'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
