Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 2.
2. **`prev`**: According to the initial state, `prev` remains 0.

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

- The first `{i}` will be replaced by the value of `i`, which is 2.
- The second `{i}` will also be replaced by the value of `i`, which is 2.
- The first `{prev}` will be replaced by the value of `prev`, which is 0.
- The second `{prev}` will also be replaced by the value of `prev`, which is 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```
? 2 2 0 0
```

Output: **? 2 2 0 0**
