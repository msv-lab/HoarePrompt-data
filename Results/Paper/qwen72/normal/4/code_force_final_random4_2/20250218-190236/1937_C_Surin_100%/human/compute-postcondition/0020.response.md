Postcondition: ***`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is equal to '<', then `v1` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
