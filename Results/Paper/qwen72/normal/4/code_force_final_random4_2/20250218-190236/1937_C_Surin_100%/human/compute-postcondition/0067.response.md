Postcondition: ***`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is a new string input, the output buffer has been flushed, `r2` is a new string input, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 3. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.***
