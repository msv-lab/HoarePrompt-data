Output State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0.**

The code snippet `v1 = 0` initializes the variable `v1` to 0. The other variables and the lambda function `R` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the additional information that `v1` is now 0.
