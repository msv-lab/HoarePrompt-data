Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the last input string.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop. Since the exact value of `v1` is not explicitly given, we can only describe it based on the condition.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.
   - The string will be `? {v1} 1 {v1} 0`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string that includes the value of `v1` twice, and the fixed values of `i` and `prev`.

Output: **? {v1} 1 {v1} 0 (where v1 is the largest integer i for which the input r was '<' during the loop)**
