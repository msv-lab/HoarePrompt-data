Postcondition: ***`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 3. Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1. If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.***
