Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, and the current value of `r` is `>`**

Explanation: The value of `prev` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
