Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed. The current value of `r` is still '='.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, which flushes the output buffer, but it does not change any of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the confirmation that the output buffer has been flushed.
