Output State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. This does not change any of the variables in the initial state, so the output state remains the same as the initial state.
