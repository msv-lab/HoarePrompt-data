### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in a permutation \(p\) of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) such that the bitwise XOR \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \((p_a \mid p_b) \, ? \, (p_c \mid p_d)\) to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements.
   - The goal is to use these queries to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) with the maximum XOR.

2. **Initial Strategy**:
   - The program starts by finding an index \(v1\) such that \(p_{v1}\) is the maximum element in the permutation. This is done by comparing \(p_0 \mid p_0\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If \(p_0 \mid p_0 < p_i \mid p_i\), then \(v1\) is updated to \(i\). This ensures that \(v1\) is the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Second Index**:
   - After determining \(v1\), the program tries to find another index \(prev\) such that \(p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1}\) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \(p_{v1} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If \(p_{v1} \mid p_i > p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\), then \(prev\) is updated to \(i\).
   - If \(p_{v1} \mid p_i = p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\), it further compares \(p_i \mid p_i\) with \(p_{prev} \mid p_{prev}\) to ensure the correct update of \(prev\).

4. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop runs \(n-1\) times, and the second loop also runs \(n-1\) times.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \(2(n-1)\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the indices \(prev\) and \(v1\) as the pair with the maximum XOR.
   - It flushes the output after each query and after the final answer to ensure the interactor receives the input correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the correct logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. It uses the bitwise OR queries effectively to determine the maximum element and then to find the second element that maximizes the XOR. The query count is within the allowed limit, and the output format is correct.

Correctness: **True**
