Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 1.
- `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
- If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
- If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to the last `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'.
- If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

### Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: This is set to `n-1`.
2. **`prev`**: The value of `prev` depends on the input string `r` and, in some cases, the input string `r2`.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is read, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - If `r` is '>', but not the first time, `prev` is set to the last `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'.
   - If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: `r` is '>'
  - `prev` is set to `n-1`.
  - Output: **! n-1 n-1**

- **Scenario 2**: `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<'
  - `prev` is set to `n-1`.
  - Output: **! n-1 n-1**

- **Scenario 3**: `r` is '=' and `r2` is not '<'
  - `prev` remains 0.
  - Output: **! 0 n-1**

- **Scenario 4**: `r` is neither '>', nor '='
  - `prev` remains 0.
  - Output: **! 0 n-1**

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement will output:
- **`prev`**: This will be either `n-1` if `r` is '>' or `r2` is '<', or 0 otherwise.
- **`v1`**: This is always `n-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! [prev] [n-1] (where [prev] is either n-1 if r is '>' or r2 is '<', or 0 otherwise, and [n-1] is the value of n-1)**
