Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables or their values. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
