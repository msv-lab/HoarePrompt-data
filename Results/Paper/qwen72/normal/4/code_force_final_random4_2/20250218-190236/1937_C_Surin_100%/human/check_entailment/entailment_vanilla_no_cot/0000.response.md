Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and initializes variables for each test case.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value**:
   - The program uses a binary search-like approach to find the index `v1` that corresponds to the maximum value in the permutation `p`.
   - It compares `p[v1] | p[v1]` with `p[i] | p[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. Since `p[i] | p[i]` is just `p[i]`, this effectively finds the maximum value in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Second Index for Maximum XOR**:
   - After finding the index `v1` of the maximum value, the program iterates through the other indices to find the index `prev` that maximizes `p[prev] ^ p[v1]`.
   - It uses a series of queries to compare `p[v1] | p[i]` with `p[v1] | p[prev]` to ensure that `prev` is the index that maximizes the XOR with `v1`.

4. **Output and Flushing**:
   - The program correctly outputs the queries and the final answer, and it flushes the output after each query to ensure the interactor receives the input.

5. **Query Limit**:
   - The program makes at most `2n - 2` queries, which is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.

Given the above points, the program should correctly find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `p_i ^ p_j` is maximized, and it adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
