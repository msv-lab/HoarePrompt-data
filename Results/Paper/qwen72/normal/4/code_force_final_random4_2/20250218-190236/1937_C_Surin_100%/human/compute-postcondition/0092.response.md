The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '<', `v1` is updated to 2.**
