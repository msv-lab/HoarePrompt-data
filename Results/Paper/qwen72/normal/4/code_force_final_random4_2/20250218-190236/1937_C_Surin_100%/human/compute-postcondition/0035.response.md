Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, and the current value of `r` is '>'**

The code `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Since `i` was 1, `prev` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
