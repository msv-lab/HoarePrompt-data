Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. `prev` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = input()` reads a new input string and assigns it to `r`.
- The value of `r` is now the new input string.
- The conditions for setting `prev` to 2 or for reading `r2` depend on the value of `r`, but since the value of `r` is not specified, `prev` remains 0.
- All other variables (`R`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
