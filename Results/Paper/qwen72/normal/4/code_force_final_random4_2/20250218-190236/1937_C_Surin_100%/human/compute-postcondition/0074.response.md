Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user.
- All other variables (`R`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`) remain unchanged.
- The output buffer is still flushed, as this state was part of the initial condition and is not affected by the code snippet.
