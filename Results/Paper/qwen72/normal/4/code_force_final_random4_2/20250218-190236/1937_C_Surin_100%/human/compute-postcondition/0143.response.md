Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to the last `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'. If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.**
