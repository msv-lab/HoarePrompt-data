Postcondition: ***`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '<', `prev` is set to 0. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.***
