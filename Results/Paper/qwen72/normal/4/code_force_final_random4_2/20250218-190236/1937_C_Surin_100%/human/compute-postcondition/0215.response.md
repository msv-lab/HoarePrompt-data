Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is the number of iterations minus 1, `n` is the final value of `n` for the last iteration, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively during the last iteration, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The `R` function remains the same as it was initially defined.
- The variable `kp` is equal to the total number of iterations minus 1.
- The variable `n` holds the final value of `n` from the last iteration.
- The variable `g` is still 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `i` is `n-1`, as the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- The variable `v2` is also `n-1`, as it is set to `i` in the inner loop.
- The variable `r` holds the last input string received during the last iteration.
- The variable `prev` holds the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or the value of `i` for which `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively during the last iteration.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration, ensuring that all outputs have been sent to the standard output.
