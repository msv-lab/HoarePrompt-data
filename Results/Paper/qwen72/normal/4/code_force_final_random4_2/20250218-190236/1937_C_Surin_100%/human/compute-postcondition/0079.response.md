Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `v2` is 1.
- `r` is the last input string.
- `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Given the initial state:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is 1.

The print statement will substitute these values into the formatted string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
