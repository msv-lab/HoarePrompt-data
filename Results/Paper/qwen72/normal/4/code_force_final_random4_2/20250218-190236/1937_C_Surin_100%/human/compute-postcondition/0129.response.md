The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1. If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.**
