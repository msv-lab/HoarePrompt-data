The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is 4. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The range limit remains 4.

State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
