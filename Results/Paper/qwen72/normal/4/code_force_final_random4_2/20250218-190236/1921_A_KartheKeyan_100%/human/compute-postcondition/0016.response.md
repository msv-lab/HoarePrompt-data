Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`.**

Explanation:
- `p1` is calculated as the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`. Specifically, `p1` is equal to `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.
- All other variables (`total`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
