Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `n` is non-zero**

The value of `res` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `total` is still 0, `coord` is still an empty list, `x` and `y` are still input integers, `p1` and `p2` retain their initial expressions, and `n` remains non-zero.
