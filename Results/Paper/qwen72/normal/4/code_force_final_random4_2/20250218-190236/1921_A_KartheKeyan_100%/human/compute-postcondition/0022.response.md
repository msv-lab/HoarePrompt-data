Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord` (which are now undefined as `coord` is empty), `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord` (which are now undefined as `coord` is empty), `n` is greater than 0**
