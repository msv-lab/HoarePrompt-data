Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list with at least 6 elements (the original 5 elements plus the new element `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are now input integers, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
