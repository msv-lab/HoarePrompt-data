Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 4 iterations:
- The variable `total` remains 0.
- The list `coord` now contains 4 tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` that were input during the loop.
- The variable `res` remains 0.
- The variables `x` and `y` are still input integers, but they will hold the values of the last input pair after the loop completes.
- The variables `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because the loop does not compute or assign any values to them.
- The variable `n` is still greater than 0, as it was not affected by the loop.
- The loop variable `i` is 3, indicating that the loop has completed its 4 iterations.
