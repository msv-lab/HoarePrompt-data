Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
2. `i` is 1.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `k` is an input integer.
5. `m` is an input integer.
6. `s` is a non-empty input string.
7. `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\).
8. `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo \((1 << k)\).
9. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement is simply printing a constant string 'YES'.
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement. They are more about the state of the program and the variables leading up to this point, but the `print` statement itself is not dependent on any of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
