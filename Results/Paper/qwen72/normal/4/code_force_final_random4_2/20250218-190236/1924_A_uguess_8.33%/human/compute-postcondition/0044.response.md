Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `tmp` is 'c'.**

The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp` to the character at the ASCII position `ord('a') + i`. Since `i` is 2, `ord('a') + 2` corresponds to the ASCII value of 'c'. The conditions regarding `i` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, and `tmp` is 'c'.
