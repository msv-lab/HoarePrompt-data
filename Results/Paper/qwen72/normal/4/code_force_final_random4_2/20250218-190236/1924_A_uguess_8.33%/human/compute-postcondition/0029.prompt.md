Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to have the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set, if it was not already set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is 0 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least three characters, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
