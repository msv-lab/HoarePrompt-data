Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has been reset due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `cnt` is set to 0.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cur` remains the same as it was in the initial state, which is 0 if it has been reset due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.
