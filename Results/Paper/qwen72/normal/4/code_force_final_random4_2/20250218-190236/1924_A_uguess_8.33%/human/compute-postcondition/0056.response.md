The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` is non-empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state must ensure that `s` is a non-empty string and `ss` is the first character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`**
