Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.), and the bit at the position `cur_ss` in the integer `cur` is now 1.** 

The value of `cur` has been updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it, which sets the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
