You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)

    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` for all iterations, `cur` is 0 if the loop has reset it due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1` in the last iteration, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a' for the last iteration, `ans` is a string that, if `cnt` is less than `n`, consists of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by the character `tmp` (which is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0), and then `(n - cnt - 1)` repetitions of the character `'a'`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is not modified, and the program prints 'YES' for each iteration where `cnt` >= `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of `k` unique characters. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string of length `n` that is constructed to contain exactly `n` sequences of `k` unique characters, based on the characters in `s`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, and the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` are in their final states as described in the annotations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s` when the answer is `NO`. Specifically, the logic for generating the string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed. The program attempts to construct a string by appending characters, but it does not ensure that the generated string is of length `n` and does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
The program should output:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the current implementation might not generate the correct string `aa` that does not occur as a subsequence in `abb`. The logic for generating the string is incorrect and does not guarantee that the generated string meets the requirements.
