Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). The bit at the position `cur_ss` in the integer `cur` was 0 and is now set to 1. The integer `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, meaning all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` are set to 1.**
