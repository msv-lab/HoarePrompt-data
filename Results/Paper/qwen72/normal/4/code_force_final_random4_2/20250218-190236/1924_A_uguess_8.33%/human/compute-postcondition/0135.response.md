Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt`.
- `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` calculates the character that is `k - 1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s`, and it is less than `n`.
- The result is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
- The values of `s`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
