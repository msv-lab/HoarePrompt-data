The code snippet `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user and assigns the values to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. These variables are converted to integers using the `map` function.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a combination of characters in `s` that set all bits in `cur` to 1, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has been reset due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.**
