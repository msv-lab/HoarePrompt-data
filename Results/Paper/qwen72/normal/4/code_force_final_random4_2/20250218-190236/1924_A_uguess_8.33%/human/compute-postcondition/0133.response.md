The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `s`, `cur`, and `cnt`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the code snippet is solely determined by the string literal within the `print` function.

Output: **NO**
