The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `k` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is 'b'. Otherwise, the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 1, and `tmp` remains unchanged.**
