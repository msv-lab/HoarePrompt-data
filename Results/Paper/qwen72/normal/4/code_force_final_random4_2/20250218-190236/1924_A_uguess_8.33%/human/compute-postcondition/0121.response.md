Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.), `cnt` remains unchanged unless `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, in which case `cnt` is increased by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
