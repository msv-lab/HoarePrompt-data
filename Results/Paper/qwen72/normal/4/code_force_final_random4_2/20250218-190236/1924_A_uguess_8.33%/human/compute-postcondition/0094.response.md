Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a', `tmp` is the character 'c'.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + i)`.
- Given that `i` is 2, `ord('a')` is 97, so `ord('a') + i` is 99.
- `chr(99)` is the character 'c'.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
