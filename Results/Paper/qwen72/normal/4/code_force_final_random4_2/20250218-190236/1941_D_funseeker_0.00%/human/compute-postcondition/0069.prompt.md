Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` now contains the elements that were in `temp`, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `r` is now an integer value of the original `r` returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is now the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `_` is 0, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the first element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans` must contain at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains both the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans` must contain at least three elements, `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains both the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '1' or '?', `temp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
