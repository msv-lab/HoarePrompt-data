### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines, which is a common and efficient way to handle input in competitive programming.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line, `func_2` converts it to an integer, and `func_3` splits a line into multiple integers.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x` who has the ball.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - The players are numbered from 1 to `n`, but the modulo operation can result in a value of 0. To handle this, the program checks if 0 is in `ans` and replaces it with `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in `ans` and then the players themselves in increasing order.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for processing each throw is correct. It considers both possible directions when `c` is '?', and only the specified direction when `c` is '0' or '1'.
- The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique.
- The adjustment for player numbering (replacing 0 with `n`) is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and follows the logic required to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
