### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines, which is efficient and appropriate for competitive programming.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line, `func_2` converts it to an integer, and `func_3` splits a line into multiple integers. This is consistent with the problem description and is a standard approach.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x` who has the ball.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw. This is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.
   - The logic for processing each throw is correct. It considers both possible directions when `c` is '?', and only the specified direction when `c` is '0' or '1'.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - The players are numbered from 1 to `n`, but the modulo operation can result in a value of 0. To handle this, the program checks if 0 is in `ans` and replaces it with `n`.
   - This adjustment is necessary because player 0 does not exist; instead, player `n` should be used. The program correctly implements this adjustment.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in `ans` and then the players themselves in increasing order.
   - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique, which is required by the problem statement.
   - The output format matches the problem description, and the players are printed in increasing order.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `c` is '?' correctly by considering both directions.
  - The program also handles the case where the ball could wrap around the circle, which is managed by the modulo operation.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the initial player `x` is 1 and the ball is thrown a distance of `n-1` in either direction, ensuring that the ball can end up with player `n`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of sets and the modulo operation ensures that the program efficiently tracks all possible positions of the ball.
  - The program's complexity is O(m * n) in the worst case, which is acceptable given the constraints (1 \le t \le 10^4, 1 \le m \le 1000, 2 \le n \le 1000).

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Final: **True**
