The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the list `ans`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` must contain at least two elements.
- `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '?', also `(q - r) % n`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.
- `q` is the next element in `ans`.

To execute the loop one more time:
- The variable `q` must be the next element in `ans`.
- The list `ans` must still contain at least one more element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least one element. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '?', also `(q - r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
