The only objects in the loop head are the loop counter `_` and the variable `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` relative to `m`. If `_` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `m`, which means the loop has completed all its iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be reset to 0, and `m` must remain unchanged.

State: **`ans` now contains the elements that were in `temp`, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `r` and `c` remain unchanged as they are determined by the string returned by `func_1()`, `_` is 0**
