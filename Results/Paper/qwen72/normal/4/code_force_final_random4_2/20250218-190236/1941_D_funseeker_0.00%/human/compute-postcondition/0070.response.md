Output State: **`ans` contains the results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in the initial `ans`, depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is '0', `ans` contains only the results of `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `ans` contains the results of both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `_` is equal to the number of elements in the initial `ans`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
