To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `q` and the set `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves `q` and `ans`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
   - `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`.
   - `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`.
   - `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the integers `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the set `ans`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `q` was the last element in `ans`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `ans` that has not been processed yet.

### Conclusion:
- The set `ans` must contain at least one more element for the loop to execute again.
- The variable `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `ans` must contain at least one more element.
- `r` and `c` remain unchanged.
- `temp` remains unchanged (it is not part of the loop head).

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n; `ans` is a set containing at least one more integer in addition to `x`; `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the integers `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
