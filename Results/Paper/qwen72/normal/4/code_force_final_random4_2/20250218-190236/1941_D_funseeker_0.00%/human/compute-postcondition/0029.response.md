The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the set `ans`. For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. The state of `q` will be determined by the elements in `ans` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` is an empty set.
- `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `temp` is an empty set.
- `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop executes, `ans` must be non-empty. Since `ans` is initially empty, it needs to be adjusted to contain at least one element.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n, `ans` must contain at least one element, `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.**
