Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws, given the constraints and the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read input from `sys.stdin` and parse it appropriately. This is a common pattern for handling input in competitive programming.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw.
   - It checks the direction of the throw (`c`), and for each current position `q` in `ans`, it adds the new possible positions to a temporary set `temp`.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the position might be `0` due to modulo operation. It discards `0` from the set and adds `n` to ensure the positions are within the valid range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly computes the possible positions of the ball after all throws, making it a valid solution to the problem.
