Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n; `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all `m` iterations, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` now contains the elements that were in `temp`. `r` and `c` remain unchanged as they are determined by the string returned by `func_1()`. The loop counter `_` is equal to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` contains the results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in the initial `ans`, depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is '0', `ans` contains only the results of `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `ans` contains the results of both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `_` is equal to the number of elements in the initial `ans`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
