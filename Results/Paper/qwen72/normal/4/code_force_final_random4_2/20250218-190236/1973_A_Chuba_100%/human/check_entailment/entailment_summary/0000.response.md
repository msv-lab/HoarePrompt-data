### Reasoning:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).
   - This check is correct because the sum of points in any valid set of games must be even.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest scorer (`v[2]`) could have gained from wins over the other two players. This ensures that the highest scorer's points are not more than the sum of the other two players' points plus the draws.
     - Subtracting `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` from the total points gives the maximum number of points that could have been distributed as draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, since each draw contributes 2 points.

3. ** edge cases**:
   - For the case where all scores are zero (`0 0 0`), the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the case where the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one draw is possible.
   - For the case where the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the case where the scores are `1 1 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because two draws are possible.
   - For the case where the scores are `3 3 3`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the case where the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because six draws are possible.
   - For the case where the scores are `1 1 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because two draws are possible.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning and the provided execution summary, the program appears to handle all edge cases and correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
