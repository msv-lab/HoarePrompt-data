Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers input by the user.** 

The code snippet `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a space-separated list of integers from the user input and assigns it to the variable `v`. This updates the value of `v`, but the other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t`) remain unchanged. The condition about the sum of the first three elements of `v` and the calculation of `result` is not executed in this code snippet, so `result` is not affected.
