The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, meaning it has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 0 after this decrement.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` has been decremented by 1 and is still greater than 0.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers input by the user. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, no changes are made to the variables. If the sum is even, `result` is set to the integer value of `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.**
