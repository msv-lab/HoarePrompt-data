The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `v`, but these variables and conditions do not affect the `print` statement in any way. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'-1'`.

Output: **-1**
