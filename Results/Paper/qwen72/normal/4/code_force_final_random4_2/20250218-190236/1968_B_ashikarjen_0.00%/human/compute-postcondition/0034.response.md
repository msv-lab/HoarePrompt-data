To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
```

The variables in the loop head are `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`**:
   - `j` is not mentioned in the state before the loop, so we need to assume an initial value for `j`. Typically, `j` would be initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

2. **Variable `m`**:
   - The state before the loop indicates that `m` is greater than or equal to 3. This ensures that `j < m` can be true when `j` is 0, as `m` is at least 3.

3. **Variable `b[j]`**:
   - The state before the loop indicates that `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`. However, the loop condition checks `b[j] != a[i]`, where `i` is 2. We need to ensure that `b[0]` is not equal to `a[2]` for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Variable `a[i]`**:
   - The state before the loop indicates that `i` is 2. Therefore, `a[i]` is `a[2]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- We need to ensure that `b[0]` is not equal to `a[2]` for the loop to execute the first time.
- The initial value of `j` should be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, and `b[0]` is not equal to `a[2]`, `j` is 0**
