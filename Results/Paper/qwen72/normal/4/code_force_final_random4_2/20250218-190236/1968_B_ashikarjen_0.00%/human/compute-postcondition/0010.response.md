The variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, and the condition `b[j] != a[i]` also needs to be considered. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `j` must be less than `m`.
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `j` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[0]` (not relevant to the loop head).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- `j` is 2, so `m` must be greater than 2 to satisfy `j < m`.
- `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[0]` to satisfy `b[j] != a[i]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[0]`**
