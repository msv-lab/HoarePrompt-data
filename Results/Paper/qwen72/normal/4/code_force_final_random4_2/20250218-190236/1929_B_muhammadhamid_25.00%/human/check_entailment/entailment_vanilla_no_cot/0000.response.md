Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling**: 
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `1` because coloring just one cell will ensure that at least one diagonal has a colored cell. This is correct.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - If `k <= 2 * n`, the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is because in a grid of size `n x n`, you can color cells in such a way that each colored cell affects two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, to cover `k` diagonals, you need at least `k / 2` cells, and you use `math.ceil` to round up to the nearest integer.
   - If `k > 2 * n`, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is because once you have covered `2 * n` diagonals with `n` cells (each cell covering two diagonals), you need to cover the remaining diagonals. Each additional cell will cover exactly one diagonal, so you need `k - 2 * n` additional cells. The total number of cells required is `n + (k - 2 * n) // 2 + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `k == 1`.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than `2 * n` by ensuring that the remaining diagonals are covered with the minimum number of additional cells.

The logic and the conditions used in the program are consistent with the problem requirements and produce the correct output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
