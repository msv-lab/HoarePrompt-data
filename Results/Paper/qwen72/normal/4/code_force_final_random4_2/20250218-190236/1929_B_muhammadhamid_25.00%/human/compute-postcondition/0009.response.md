Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\).
- `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, with the constraint \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\).
- If `k` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
- Additionally, `k` is greater than \(2n\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `k`**: According to the initial state, `k` is greater than \(2n\). This means \(k > 2n\).
2. **Expression `k // 2 + 1`**:
   - `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2, which means it will return the largest integer less than or equal to \(k / 2\).
   - Adding 1 to this result gives us \(k // 2 + 1\).

### Calculation:
- Since \(k > 2n\), \(k // 2\) will be greater than \(n\).
- Therefore, \(k // 2 + 1\) will be greater than \(n + 1\).

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of \(k // 2 + 1\), which is an integer greater than \(n + 1\).

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer greater than 2n and n is an integer in the range 2 to 10^8)**
