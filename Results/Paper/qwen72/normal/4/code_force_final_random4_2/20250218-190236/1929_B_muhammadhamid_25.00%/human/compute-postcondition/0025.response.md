Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\).
   - `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, with the constraint \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\).
   - If `k` is 1, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to \(2n\), the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true.
   - Otherwise, `k` is greater than \(2n\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(k // 2 + 1)`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - We need to determine the value of `k // 2 + 1` based on the given conditions.
   - If `k` is 1, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, so `k` is 1.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to \(2n\), the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true, and `k` can be any integer from 1 to \(2n\).
   - If `k` is greater than \(2n\), the condition `k <= 2 * n` is false, and `k` can be any integer from \(2n + 1\) to \(4n - 2\).

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - **Case 1: `k` is 1**
     - `k // 2` is \(1 // 2 = 0\).
     - `k // 2 + 1` is \(0 + 1 = 1\).
     - Output: **1**

   - **Case 2: `k` is less than or equal to \(2n\)**
     - `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
     - `k // 2 + 1` is the result of this division plus 1.
     - For example, if `k` is 4 and `n` is 3, then `k // 2` is \(4 // 2 = 2\), and `k // 2 + 1` is \(2 + 1 = 3\).
     - Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer from 1 to 2n)**

   - **Case 3: `k` is greater than \(2n\)**
     - `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
     - `k // 2 + 1` is the result of this division plus 1.
     - For example, if `k` is 7 and `n` is 3, then `k // 2` is \(7 // 2 = 3\), and `k // 2 + 1` is \(3 + 1 = 4\).
     - Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer from 2n + 1 to 4n - 2)**

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we need to consider all possible cases.
   - The output will be `k // 2 + 1` based on the value of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer from 1 to 4n - 2, and n is an integer from 2 to 10^8)**
