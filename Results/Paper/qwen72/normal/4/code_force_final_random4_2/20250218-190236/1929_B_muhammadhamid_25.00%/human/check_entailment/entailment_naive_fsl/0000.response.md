Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly. According to the problem description, the grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. If \( k = 4n - 2 \), then all diagonals must have at least one colored cell. However, the program does not account for this specific case and will return an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 10
```
The program will output:
```
5
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
6
```
This is because to cover all 10 diagonals in a 3x3 grid, you need to color 6 cells, as shown in the example provided in the problem description. The program's logic does not correctly handle this edge case.
