Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the base case where `k == 1`. In this case, it prints `1` because coloring one cell is enough to satisfy the condition of having at least one diagonal with a colored cell.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - If `k <= 2 * n`, the function prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because in a grid of size `n x n`, the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by coloring cells in a single row or column is `2 * n`. Each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, to cover `k` diagonals, you need at least `math.ceil(k / 2)` cells.
   - If `k > 2 * n`, the function prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is also correct because once you have covered `2 * n` diagonals using `n` cells (one cell per row or column), you need to cover the remaining diagonals. Each additional cell can cover 2 diagonals, so you need `k // 2` additional cells. However, since `k` is odd in this case, you need one more cell to cover the last diagonal, hence `k // 2 + 1`.

4. **Output**: The function correctly prints the minimum number of cells required for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k` is exactly `2 * n`.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k` is `4 * n - 2`, which is the maximum possible value for `k`.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
