### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color a minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals (both primary and secondary diagonals).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - It then checks if \( k \) is 1. If so, it prints 1 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
   - If \( k \) is greater than \( 2n \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \( k = 1 \)**
     - If \( k = 1 \), the minimum number of cells to color is 1, which is correct.
   - **Case 2: \( k \leq 2n \)**
     - For \( k \leq 2n \), the program prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is because in the best case, each colored cell can cover 2 diagonals (one primary and one secondary). Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
   - **Case 3: \( k > 2n \)**
     - For \( k > 2n \), the program prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because after covering \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells, each additional cell can cover 2 more diagonals. However, the last cell might need to cover an odd number of diagonals, so we add 1 to ensure all \( k \) diagonals are covered.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
     - \( k \leq 2n \) (4 <= 6), so the program prints \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
   - **Example 2: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
     - \( k \leq 2n \) (3 <= 6), so the program prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
   - **Example 3: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
     - \( k > 2n \) (10 > 6), so the program prints \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \).
   - **Example 4: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)**
     - \( k > 2n \) (9 > 6), so the program prints \( 9 // 2 + 1 = 5 \).
   - **Example 5: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)**
     - \( k \leq 2n \) (7 <= 8), so the program prints \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \).
   - **Example 6: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)**
     - \( k \leq 2n \) (11 <= 14), so the program prints \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \).
   - **Example 7: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
     - \( k > 2n \) (3 > 4), so the program prints \( 3 // 2 + 1 = 2 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement.
