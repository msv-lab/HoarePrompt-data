The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop mentioned in the initial state, the `continue` statement would result in an error if executed. However, assuming this code is part of a loop (as `continue` is only valid within a loop), the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The current value of `k` is still 1, and `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), `k` is 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
