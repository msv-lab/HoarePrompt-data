You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' (1 <= len(s) <= 500). It then processes each string `s` to count the number of positions where the integer value of the character at position `i` is not equal to the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`. If there is no position where the integer value of the character at position `i` is less than the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`, the function prints `count + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `count`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the binary string is already sorted. For example, for the input "00000000", the program outputs 1, which is correct. However, for the input "1", the program outputs 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, as the string "1" is already sorted and does not need to be cut into pieces.

Additionally, the program incorrectly handles the case where the string is not sorted and contains a transition from '0' to '1'. For example, for the input "0110", the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 2 pieces: "01" and "10", which can be rearranged to "0110" or "1001" (both of which are sorted). However, the program's logic does not correctly count the pieces needed for such cases.
