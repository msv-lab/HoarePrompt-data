Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' (1 <= len(s) <= 500). It then processes each string `s` to count the number of positions where the integer value of the character at position `i` is not equal to the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`. If there is no position where the integer value of the character at position `i` is less than the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`, the function prints `count + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `count`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
