You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1

            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single parameter, a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= len(s) <= 500. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is `t - 1`, `s` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count` is the number of positions in the string `s` where the integer value of the character at position `i` is not equal to the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`. If `flag` is 0, indicating that there is no position in the string `s` where the integer value of the character at position `i` is less than the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`, then the program prints `count + 1`. If `flag` is 1, indicating that there is at least one position in the string `s` where the integer value of the character at position `i` is less than the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`, then the program prints `count`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' (1 <= len(s) <= 500). It then processes each string `s` to count the number of positions where the integer value of the character at position `i` is not equal to the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`. If there is no position where the integer value of the character at position `i` is less than the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`, the function prints `count + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `count`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a binary string \( s \), find the minimum number of contiguous pieces to cut it into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
- A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a binary string.
- The output should be the minimum number of pieces for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string \( s \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of cuts needed.
   - `flag` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to determine if the string is already sorted or not.

3. **Loop Through the String:**
   - The program iterates through the string \( s \) from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - For each character \( s[i] \), it checks if \( s[i] \) is different from \( s[i + 1] \).
   - If \( s[i] \) is different from \( s[i + 1] \), it increments `count` by 1.
   - If \( s[i] \) is less than \( s[i + 1] \) (i.e., '0' followed by '1'), it sets `flag` to 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program checks the value of `flag`.
   - If `flag` is 0, it means the string is already sorted, and it prints `count + 1`.
   - If `flag` is 1, it prints `count`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case 1: String is already sorted (all '0's before all '1's):**
  - If the string is already sorted, `flag` will remain 0.
  - `count` will be the number of transitions from '0' to '1' (which is 0 in this case).
  - The program prints `count + 1`, which is 1. This is correct because no cuts are needed.

- **Case 2: String has '1's before '0's:**
  - If the string has '1's before '0's, `flag` will be set to 1.
  - `count` will be the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0'.
  - The program prints `count`, which is the number of cuts needed to separate the '0's and '1's so they can be rearranged.

- **Case 3: String has mixed '0's and '1's:**
  - If the string has mixed '0's and '1's, the program will correctly count the number of transitions.
  - However, the program should print `count + 1` in all cases where `count` is non-zero, because the last piece (after the last cut) must also be counted.

### Issues:
- The program prints `count + 1` only if `flag` is 0, but it should print `count + 1` in all cases where the string is not already sorted.
- For example, in the test case "0110", the program will print 2, but it should print 3 because we need to cut it into "0", "11", and "0" to rearrange it into "0011".

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the case where the string is not already sorted correctly. It should always print `count + 1` to account for the last piece.

Correctness: **False**
