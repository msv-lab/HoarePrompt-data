Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` updates the `nums` list to a new list of integers input by the user.
- The value of `x` remains `len(nums) - 1`, but now `len(nums)` is the length of the new list.
- The `start_year` is still updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`.
- The `num_tests` is still decreased by 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
