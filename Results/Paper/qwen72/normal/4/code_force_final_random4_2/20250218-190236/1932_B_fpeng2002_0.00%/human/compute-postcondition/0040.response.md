Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))` for all test cases, and `n` and `nums` have been processed for all test cases.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `num_tests` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, the variable `start_year` has been updated to the smallest multiple of the last element in the list `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year` after iterating through all elements in `nums`.
- The variables `n` and `nums` have been used to process each test case, and their values have been updated accordingly for each iteration of the loop.
