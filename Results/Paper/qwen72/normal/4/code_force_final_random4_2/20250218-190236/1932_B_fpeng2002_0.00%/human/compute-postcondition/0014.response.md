The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` must have been decremented by 1 (or more, depending on the loop body) to ensure the loop can continue. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least `num_tests` elements, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations, `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
