Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is 2, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
- The value of `x` remains 2.
- The list `nums` remains unchanged and still contains at least 2 integers input by the user.
