The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is the integer value of the input provided. For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
