Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`nums`**: This is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least `num_tests` elements.
2. **`x`**: This is defined as `len(nums) - 1`, which means `x` is the index of the last element in the `nums` list.
3. **`start_year`**: This is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` (which is `nums[x]`) that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start_year)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `nums`**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - For example, if the user inputs `1 2 3 4 5`, then `nums` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **Understanding `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the last element in the `nums` list.
   - If `nums` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `x` will be `4` (since the last element is at index 4).

3. **Understanding `start_year`**:
   - `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` (the last element in `nums`) that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations.
   - This implies that `start_year` is being updated in a loop, but the loop is not provided in the code snippet. However, the precondition states that after all iterations, `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year + 1`.

4. **Calculating `start_year`**:
   - Let's assume `start_year` is initially some value `Y`.
   - After all iterations, `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `Y + 1`.
   - For example, if `nums` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `x` is `4`, then `nums[x]` is `5`.
   - If `start_year` is initially `10`, then the smallest multiple of `5` greater than `10 + 1` (which is `11`) is `15`.

### Final Output:
The `print(start_year)` statement will print the smallest multiple of the last element in the `nums` list that is greater than the initial `start_year + 1` after all iterations.

Since the exact initial value of `start_year` and the number of iterations are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `start_year`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of the last element in the `nums` list that is greater than the initial start_year + 1 after all iterations)**
