The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 3 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 7, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`**
