Let's break down the print statement and the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \) (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `n + 1` (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning it will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `1`, followed by `n`, followed by the unpacked range from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the range from 1 to n is the sequence of integers from 1 to n)**
