Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\).
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant value, so it will always print `1`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Given `j = 1`, the expression simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range, so each integer in the range will be printed as separate arguments.

### Final Output:
- The first argument `1` will be printed as `1`.
- The second argument `n - j + 1` will be printed as `n`.
- The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the integers from 1 to `n` as separate arguments.

### Example:
If `n = 3`, the output will be:
```
1 3 1 2 3
```

### General Case:
For any `n` greater than or equal to 2, the output will be:
```
1 n 1 2 3 ... n
```

### Final Answer:
Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., n represents the integers from 1 to n)**
