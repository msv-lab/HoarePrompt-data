Let's break down the print statement and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\).
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
   - The first argument to the `print` function is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This means it will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 1`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **2, n - 1, 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the range from 1 to n is the sequence of integers from 1 to n)**
