The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the input integer, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{i} k^3\), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the input integer, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`.**
