The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\), `i` is `n`, `j` is 3**
