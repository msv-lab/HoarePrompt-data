Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all of its iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `sum`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial values. The loop variable `j` will have reached the value `n`, which is the upper limit of the range specified in the loop head (`range(1, n + 1)`). This means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and `j` has been incremented from 1 to `n` during the process.
