Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the sum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
   - Simplifying the term inside the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the formula becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - The sum of \(2i^2\) from \(i=2\) to \(n\) is:
     \[
     2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - The sum of \(i\) from \(i=2\) to \(n\) is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Combining these, the final sum is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying further, we get:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n + 2 - 3)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n - 1)}{6}
     \]
   - This matches the expected maximum sum for the matrix, which is \(n^3\).

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the sum and `2n`, which is the correct number of operations.
   - For each value from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines: one for a type 1 operation and one for a type 2 operation. Both operations use the same permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Operation Validity**:
   - Type 1 and Type 2 operations are correctly applied to the matrix.
   - The permutations used are valid as they are always `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Matrix Sum Maximization**:
   - The operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which maximizes the sum of the matrix to \(n^3\).

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly handles the input, calculates the maximum sum, and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

Correctness: **True**
