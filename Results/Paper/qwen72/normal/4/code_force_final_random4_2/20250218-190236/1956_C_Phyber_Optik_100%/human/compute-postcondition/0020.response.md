Let's break down the print statement and the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\). This means `sum` is the sum of 1 and the cubes of all integers from 2 to `n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer 2.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to `n - 3 + 1`, which is `n - 2`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The integer 2 will be printed as is.
   - The value of `n - 2` will be printed.
   - The range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) will be printed as a sequence of integers.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The first element is 2.
   - The second element is `n - 2`.
   - The subsequent elements are the integers from 1 to `n`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., n represents the integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
