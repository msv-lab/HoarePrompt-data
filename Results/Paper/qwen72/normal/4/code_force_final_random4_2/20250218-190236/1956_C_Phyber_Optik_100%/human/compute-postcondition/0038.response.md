Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \) (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `n + 1` (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer 2.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - The third argument uses the `*` operator to unpack the range `range(1, n + 1)`. This will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the integer 2, followed by `n - 1`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **2, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
