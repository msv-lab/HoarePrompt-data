To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
```
The variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and this sequence must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (this is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `sum` is \( n^3 \) (this is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
- `i` is `n + 1` (this is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
- `j` is `n` (this is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `j` will be initialized to 1 by the `range` function, and it will iterate from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1**
