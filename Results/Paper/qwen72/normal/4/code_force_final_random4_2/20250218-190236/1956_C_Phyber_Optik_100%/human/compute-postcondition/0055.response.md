Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `sum` is calculated as \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\).
- `i` is \(n + 1\).
- `j` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Element: `1`**
   - This is a constant value and will always be printed as `1`.

2. **Second Element: `n - j + 1`**
   - Given `j` is 1, the expression `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.
   - Therefore, this will print the value of `n`.

3. **Third Element: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so each number in the range will be printed as separate elements.

### Final Output:
- The first element is `1`.
- The second element is `n`.
- The third element is the unpacked sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 3, the output will be:
```
1 3 1 2 3
```

### General Output:
For any `n` greater than or equal to 2, the output will be:
```
1 n 1 2 3 ... n
```

### Final Answer:
Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence is from 1 to n inclusive)**
