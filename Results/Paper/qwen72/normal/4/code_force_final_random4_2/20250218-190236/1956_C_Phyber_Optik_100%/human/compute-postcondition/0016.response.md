Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\).
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument in the `print` statement is `1`, which is a constant.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - The third argument uses the `*` operator to unpack the `range(1, n + 1)` sequence. This sequence generates a list of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 1`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the integers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
