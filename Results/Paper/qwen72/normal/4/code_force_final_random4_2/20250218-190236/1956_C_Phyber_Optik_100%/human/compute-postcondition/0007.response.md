The value of `sum` is updated by adding the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. The initial value of `sum` is `1 + 2 * (2 * 2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `1 + 2 * 3 = 7`. The value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `sum`, but we can express it in terms of `i`. The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to `(i * i - (i * i - 2 * i + 1)) * i = (2 * i - 1) * i = 2 * i * i - i`.

Therefore, the new value of `sum` is `7 + 2 * i * i - i`.

The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is `7 + 2 * i * i - i`.**
