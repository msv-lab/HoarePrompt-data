The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, because the range function will generate values from 2 to `n` inclusive, and the loop will run for each of these values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `sum` is 1 (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `i` is `n` (this needs to be adjusted to start from 2 for the loop to execute).
- `j` is `n` (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` must start from 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`**
