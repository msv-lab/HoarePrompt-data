Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 2.
- The variable `sum` remains unchanged and is still equal to \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\).
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n`.
- The variable `j` will be equal to `n` after the loop has completed all its iterations, because the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
