### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
   - Simplifying the term inside the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - The sum of squares from 2 to n is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 - 1 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1
     \]
   - The sum of integers from 2 to n is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i - 1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Substituting these into the sum formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 3n(n+1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n + 2 - 3)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n - 1)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula is correct for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix.

2. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program prints `2n` as the number of operations for each test case.
   - According to the problem, the number of operations should be no more than `2n`, and the program adheres to this constraint.

3. **Operations Generation:**
   - The program generates `2n` operations, where for each `j` from 1 to `n`, it prints:
     - `1 n - j + 1 *range(1, n + 1)` (Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`)
     - `2 n - j + 1 *range(1, n + 1)` (Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`)
   - For `n = 1`, the program will output:
     ```
     1 2
     1 1 1
     2 1 1
     ```
     - The sum is `1`, and the number of operations is `2`, which is correct as it meets the requirement of no more than `2n` operations.
   - For `n = 2`, the program will output:
     ```
     7 4
     1 2 1 2
     2 2 1 2
     1 1 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
     - The sum is `7`, which is correct.
     - The number of operations is `4`, which is within the limit of `2n`.
     - The operations set each row and column to the permutation `1, 2`, which is a valid way to achieve the maximum sum of `7`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and generates a valid sequence of operations that achieves this sum within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
