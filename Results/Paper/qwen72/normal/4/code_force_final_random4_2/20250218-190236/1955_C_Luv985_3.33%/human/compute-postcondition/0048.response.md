Postcondition: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2` if `a[n - 1]` is 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`. If both `a[l]` and `a[n - 1]` are 0, `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
