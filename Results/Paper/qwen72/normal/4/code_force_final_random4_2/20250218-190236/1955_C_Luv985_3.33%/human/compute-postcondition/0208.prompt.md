You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of pairs (n, k), and a list of lists a. t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each pair (n, k) in the list of pairs represents the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. Each list in a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the durability of the ships, with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The length of the list of pairs and the list of lists a should be equal to t. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

It returns a list of results, where each result is the number of ships that remain intact after the specified number of attacks for each test case.
