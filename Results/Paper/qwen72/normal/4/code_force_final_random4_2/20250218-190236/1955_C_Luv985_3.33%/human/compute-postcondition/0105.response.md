Output State: **`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi` and has been reduced by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is `0 - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and `mi` is 0 if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update.**

Explanation:
- `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
