To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to check the conditions in the loop head: `l < r` and `k > 0`.

1. **Condition 1: `l < r`**
   - Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than 0. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 0, or `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: `k > 0`**
   - Right before the loop, `k` is an input integer.
   - For `k > 0` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that both `n` is greater than 1 and `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0**
