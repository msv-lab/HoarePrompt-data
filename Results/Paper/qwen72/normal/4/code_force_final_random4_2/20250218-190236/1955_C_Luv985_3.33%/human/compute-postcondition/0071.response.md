Output State: **`T` is no longer a boolean, `T` is now an integer with the value 0.** 

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `T` is True, which is a boolean value. The operation `T -= 1` is equivalent to `T = T - 1`. Since `True` is treated as 1 in arithmetic operations, `T` becomes 0 after the operation. Therefore, `T` is no longer a boolean but an integer with the value 0.
