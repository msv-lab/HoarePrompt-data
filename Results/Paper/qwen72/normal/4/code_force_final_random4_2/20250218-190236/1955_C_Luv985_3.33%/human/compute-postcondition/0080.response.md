To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while l < r and k > 0:
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `l < r`
2. `k > 0`

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `T` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an integer converted from the first string from the input (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `k` is an integer converted from the second string from the input
- `a` is a list of integers converted from the list of strings from the input (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `ans` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `l < r`**:
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - For `l < r` to be true, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition `k > 0`**:
   - `k` is an integer converted from the second string from the input.
   - For `k > 0` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure `l < r` is true.
- `k` must be greater than 0 to ensure `k > 0` is true.

### Final State:
State: **`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from the list of strings from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0**
