The code snippet `n, k = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`. Both `n` and `k` are now strings.

Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of lists, `n` and `k` are input strings.**
