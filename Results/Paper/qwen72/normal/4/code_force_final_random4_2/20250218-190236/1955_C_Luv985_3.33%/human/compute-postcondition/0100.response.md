Postcondition: ***`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` before the if-else block. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 2, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[l]`) is 0. If `a[r]` is 0, the second-to-last element of `a` (i.e., `a[r]`) is also 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1 if `mi - (k % 2) - (k // 2)` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
