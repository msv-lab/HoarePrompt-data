Postcondition: **`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 unless `a[0]` is 0, in which case `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 0 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[r]` are both decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is 1 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2, and if `a[0]` is 0 and the last element of `a` is 0, `ans` is 3. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains greater than 0, `ans` is 1 if `mi - T - k // 2 == 0` unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2, and `t` is set to `k % 2`. In all cases, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`.**
