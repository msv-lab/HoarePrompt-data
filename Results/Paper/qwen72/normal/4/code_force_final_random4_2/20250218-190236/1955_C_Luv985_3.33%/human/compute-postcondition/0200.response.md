Postcondition: ***`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 unless `a[0]` is 0, in which case `l` is 1 or 2 if `a[l]` was 0, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 0 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `mi * 2 > k` and `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is `k % 2`.***
