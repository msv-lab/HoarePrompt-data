Postcondition: **`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left or `n - 1` if all elements from the left are zero, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right or 0 if all elements from the right are zero, `ans` is the count of elements in `a` that are zero or negative between the indices `l` and `r` (inclusive) after the loop has finished executing, and `l` is equal to `r`.**
