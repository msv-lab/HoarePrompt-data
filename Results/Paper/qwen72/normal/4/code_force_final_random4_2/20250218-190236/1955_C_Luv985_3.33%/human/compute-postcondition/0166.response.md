Postcondition: ***`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1.***
