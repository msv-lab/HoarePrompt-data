Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9 and are assigned the values from the input, `q` is greater than 2, `mn` is 100, `i` is 2. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, if `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true. If neither `a < b > c` nor `a < b < c` is true, then both conditions are false.**
