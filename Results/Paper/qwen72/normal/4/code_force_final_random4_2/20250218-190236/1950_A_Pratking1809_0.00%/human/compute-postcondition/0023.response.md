Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\) and are assigned values from the input.
   - `q` is greater than 2.
   - `mn` is 100.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true.
   - Otherwise, if `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` is true.
   - If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, then both conditions are false.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('PEAK')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'PEAK'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
