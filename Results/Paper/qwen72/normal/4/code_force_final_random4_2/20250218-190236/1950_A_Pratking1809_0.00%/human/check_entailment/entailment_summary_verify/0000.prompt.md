You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks the relationship between these digits and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input integer `q` and the digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case are processed, and the final state of the program is that the results of the comparisons have been printed for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both conditions for a stair and a peak are met, which is logically impossible but the program does not explicitly check for this. However, the main issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case where neither condition is met. Specifically, the program will print 'NONE' if the first condition (a < b < c) is not met, even if the second condition (a < b > c) is true. This can be seen in the following example:

Input:
```
1
3 4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
PEAK
```

Actual Output:
```
NONE
```

The program should check both conditions and only print 'NONE' if neither condition is satisfied. The current implementation prints 'NONE' after checking the first condition, which can lead to incorrect output if the second condition is true but the first is false.
