Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9 and are assigned the values from the input, `q` is greater than 1, `mn` is 100, `i` is 1. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` is false, and the condition `a < b > c` can be either true or false.***
