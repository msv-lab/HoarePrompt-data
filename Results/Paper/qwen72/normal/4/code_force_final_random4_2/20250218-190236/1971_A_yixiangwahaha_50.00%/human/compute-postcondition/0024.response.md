Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times.
   - `i` is 1.
   - If `x[1]` is less than `y[1]`, the current value of `x[1]` is less than the current value of `y[1]`. Otherwise, `x[1]` is greater than or equal to `y[1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `x[1]` and `y[1]` are the second elements of the lists `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - According to the initial state, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times. Therefore, `x[1]` is the same as the first element of `xylist`.
   - Similarly, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times. Therefore, `y[1]` is the same as the second element of `xylist`.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `y[1]`, followed by a space, and then the value of `x[1]`.

4. **Output Description:**
   - Since `x[1]` and `y[1]` are the same as the first and second elements of `xylist`, respectively, the output will be the second element of `y` followed by a space and the second element of `x`.
   - The exact numerical values of these elements depend on the values in `xylist`.

Output: **y[1] ' ' x[1] (where y[1] is the second element of the list y and x[1] is the second element of the list x, both of which are the same as the second and first elements of xylist, respectively)**
