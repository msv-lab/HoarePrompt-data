### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `input()`.
   - However, the program does not use `t` in any meaningful way. Instead, it assumes that there are always 10 test cases, which is incorrect according to the problem description where `t` can vary from 1 to 100.

2. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The program uses a fixed loop `for i in range(10)` to read 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This will cause issues if `t` is not exactly 10.
   - For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` and appends them to the lists `x` and `y`.

3. **Output**:
   - After reading the inputs, the program uses another fixed loop `for i in range(10)` to process and print the results.
   - For each pair `(x[i], y[i])`, it prints the minimum and maximum values in the correct order.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the number of test cases `t`. It always reads and processes 10 test cases, which is incorrect if `t` is not 10.
- The program should use `t` to determine the number of test cases to read and process.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the number of test cases `t` properly.
- The program will fail if the number of test cases is not exactly 10.

Correctness: **False**
