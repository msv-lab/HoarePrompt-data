Output State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list.** 

The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, the function receives two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 9. However, in the given code snippet, `y` is reassigned to an empty list, and `x` remains an empty list. The value of `t` is unchanged.
