Output State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, and `i` is 9. The loop has completed all 10 iterations, and for each index `i` from 0 to 9, if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` were printed in the order `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `y[i]` and `x[i]` were printed in the order `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all 10 iterations, the variable `i` has been incremented from 0 to 9. The lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged, each containing the integer values of the first and second elements of `xylist` repeated ten times, respectively. The loop has printed the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` for each `i` from 0 to 9, ensuring that the smaller value is printed first followed by the larger value.
