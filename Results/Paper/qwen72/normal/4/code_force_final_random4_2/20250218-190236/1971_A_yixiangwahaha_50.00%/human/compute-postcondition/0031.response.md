The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, the function receives two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 9. The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each with two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9). It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
