Output State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, `i` is 9.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 10 iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as the initial input string representing a non-negative integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` that was input during each iteration, repeated 10 times.
- The variable `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` that was input during each iteration, repeated 10 times.
- The loop counter `i` has the value 9, which is the last index of the range (0 to 9) that the loop iterates over.
