Output State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer between 1 and 100.
- `x` is initially an empty list.
- `y` is initially an empty list.
- `i` is initially 0.
- `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `t` on spaces.

After executing the code snippet:
- The first element of `xylist` is converted to an integer and appended to the list `x`.
- The value of `x` is now a list containing a single integer, which is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`.
- The other variables (`t`, `y`, `i`, and `xylist`) remain unchanged.
