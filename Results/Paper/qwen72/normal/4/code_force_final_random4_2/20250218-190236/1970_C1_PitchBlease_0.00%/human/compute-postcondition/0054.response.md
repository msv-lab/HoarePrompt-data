Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` is a valid node index, and `tree[current]` is a list with at least 3 elements. `neighbor` is the third element in `tree[current]`. `dist` is the distance of `current` from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited, plus `neighbor`. The `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**
