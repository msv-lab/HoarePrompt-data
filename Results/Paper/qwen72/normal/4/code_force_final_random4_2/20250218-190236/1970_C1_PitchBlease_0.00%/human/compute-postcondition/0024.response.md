Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are now the values of the first tuple that was in `queue`, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`. `queue` now contains the remaining tuples, excluding the one that was just processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` from the start node to the current node. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated `queue` and `visited` set.***
