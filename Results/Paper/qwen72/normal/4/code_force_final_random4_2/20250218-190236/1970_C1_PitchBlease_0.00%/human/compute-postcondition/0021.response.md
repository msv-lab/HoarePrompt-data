The only variable in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their respective distances from `start` that have not yet been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must still contain at least one tuple.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list. `current` is the last node processed that is not equal to `target`. `dist` is the distance from `start` to the last node processed. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their respective distances from `start` that have not yet been processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited, and `queue` must contain at least one tuple.**
