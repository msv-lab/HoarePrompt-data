Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single element, which is a tuple containing the value of `start` and 0. `visited` is a set containing the value of `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list. `current` is the last node processed that is not equal to `target`. `dist` is the distance from `start` to the last node processed. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their respective distances from `start` that have not yet been processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are the values of the last tuple that was processed from `queue`, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`. `queue` now contains all the tuples that were added during the loop execution, excluding the tuples that were processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` from the start node to the current node. Otherwise, the loop has finished processing all nodes in the queue, and `queue` is now empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the distance of `current` from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter than it was at the beginning of the last iteration, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If the loop completes without finding the `target` node, `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all nodes that were reachable from `start`. If `current` is equal to `target` at any point, the program returns the distance `dist` of the node `current` from the starting node `start`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
