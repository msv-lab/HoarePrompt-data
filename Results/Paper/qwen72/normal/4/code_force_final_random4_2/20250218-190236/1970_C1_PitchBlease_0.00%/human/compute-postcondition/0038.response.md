Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are the values of the last tuple that was processed from `queue`, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`. `queue` now contains all the tuples that were added during the loop execution, excluding the tuples that were processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` from the start node to the current node. Otherwise, the loop has finished processing all nodes in the queue, and `queue` is now empty.**
