You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `start` and `target` remain integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `queue` is now empty, indicating that all nodes reachable from `start` have been processed. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `target` was found, the loop returned the distance `dist` from `start` to `target`. If `target` was not found, the loop has finished without returning a distance, and `visited` contains all nodes that were reachable from `start`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the tree starting from the start node.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing node indices in a tree. It returns 0 if the start node is the same as the target node. If the target node is found during the BFS, it returns the distance from the start node to the target node. If the BFS completes and the target node is found, it returns the distance from the start node to the current node. If the target node is not found, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the distance `dist` from the start node to the current node, where `dist` is the distance of the first tuple that was in `queue` before it was processed.

Case_3: The program returns the distance `dist` of the node `current` from the starting node `start`. `dist` is the value of the distance component of the tuple that was at the front of the `queue` before the operation, and `current` is the node that was at the front of the `queue` before the operation.

Case_4: The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the tree starting from the start node.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
