### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to find a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then printed.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `s` is constructed as `s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n`.
     - This means `s` will be a repetition of the first `k` alphabets `n` times.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, `s` will be `abcbac`.

   - **Subsequence Property:**
     - To check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`, consider the structure of `s`.
     - `s` is a concatenation of the first `k` alphabets repeated `n` times.
     - This structure ensures that any combination of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets will appear in `s` as a subsequence.
     - For example, in `s = abcbac`:
       - `aa` can be found as `a` in the first `abc` and `a` in the second `bac`.
       - `ab` can be found as `ab` in the first `abc`.
       - `ac` can be found as `a` in the first `abc` and `c` in the second `bac`.
       - `ba` can be found as `ba` in the second `bac`.
       - `bb` can be found as `b` in the first `abc` and `b` in the second `bac`.
       - `bc` can be found as `bc` in the first `abc`.
       - `ca` can be found as `c` in the first `abc` and `a` in the second `bac`.
       - `cb` can be found as `cb` in the first `abc`.
       - `cc` can be found as `c` in the first `abc` and `c` in the second `bac`.

   - **Optimality:**
     - The length of `s` is `k * n`.
     - This is the smallest possible length because each character in the first `k` alphabets must appear at least `n` times to ensure all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly constructs a string `s` that satisfies the problem requirements.
   - The string `s` is the shortest possible string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
