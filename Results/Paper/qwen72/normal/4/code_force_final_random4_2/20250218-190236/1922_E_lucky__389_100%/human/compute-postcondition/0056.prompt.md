Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `x` is the input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** i <= x:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
        x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
        mx = max(mx, i - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i ≤ x. If `i` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is reduced by 2, and `mx` is the maximum value between the original `mx` and `i - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `mx` is 0. If `i` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2` and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\). If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2` and `mx` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `mx` and `i - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
