Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of the increasing subsequences and must have at least two elements.
   - `mx` is the maximum length of any subsequence in `subseq_lens`.
   - `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens)-1]` appended and must have at least one element.
   - `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `subseq_lens` is a list with at least two elements. For example, it could be `[3, 5, 2, 7]`.
   - `mx` is the maximum length of any subsequence in `subseq_lens`. For the example list `[3, 5, 2, 7]`, `mx` would be 7.
   - `ansv` is constructed by first creating a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and then appending all elements from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens)-1]`. For the example list `[3, 5, 2, 7]`, `ansv` would be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 2, 7]`.
   - `i` is the index of the last element in `subseq_lens`. For the example list `[3, 5, 2, 7]`, `i` would be 3.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(ansv[i], end=' ')`.
   - `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in `subseq_lens`.
   - Therefore, `ansv[i]` will be the last element of `subseq_lens` appended to `ansv`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - If `subseq_lens` is `[3, 5, 2, 7]`, then `i` is 3.
   - The last element of `subseq_lens` is 7.
   - `ansv` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 2, 7]`.
   - `ansv[3]` is 7.

5. **General Case:**
   - Regardless of the specific values in `subseq_lens`, `i` will always be the index of the last element in `subseq_lens`.
   - The last element of `subseq_lens` will always be the last element appended to `ansv`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the last element of `subseq_lens`.

Output: **last element of `subseq_lens`**
