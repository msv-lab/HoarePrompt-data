#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the standard input. If `X` is 2, it prints the integers 1 and 0, each on a new line, and then returns `None`. For other values of `X`, it constructs a list `ansv` of integers such that the list has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` on a single line separated by spaces, and then returns `None`. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.
