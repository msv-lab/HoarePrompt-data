Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `x` which represents the number of increasing subsequences required.

2. **Base Case Handling**: The program handles the base case when `x == 2` by printing `1` and `0`, which is correct because an array of length 1 with a single element has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.

3. **Subsequence Length Calculation**: The program attempts to construct an array that has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. It does this by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` and subtracting that power of 2 from `x`. This approach is based on the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.

4. **Array Construction**: The program constructs the array `ansv` by first creating a list of integers from `0` to `mx-1` (where `mx` is the maximum length of any subsequence found). Then, it appends the lengths of the subsequences found to `ansv`. This ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**: The program prints the length of the constructed array `ansv` and then prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. This is the correct format for the output.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where `x` is a power of 2 by breaking the loop when `x` becomes 0. However, it does not handle the case where `x` is 1, which is outside the valid range for `x` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). Since the problem description guarantees that `x` will be at least 2, this is not an issue.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm used to construct the array is based on the properties of binary numbers and the fact that the number of increasing subsequences can be represented as a sum of powers of 2. This is a valid approach, and the program correctly constructs the array to meet the requirements.

8. **Range of Elements**: The elements of the array are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], as required by the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct in its approach and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
