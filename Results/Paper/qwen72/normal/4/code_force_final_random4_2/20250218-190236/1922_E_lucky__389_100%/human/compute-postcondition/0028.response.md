The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `x` must still satisfy the condition `2 ** i <= x`. Since `2 ** 2` is 4, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 4, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2**
