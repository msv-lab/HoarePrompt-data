Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. `x` is the input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2 and `x` is not equal to 0. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. `i` is 0.**
