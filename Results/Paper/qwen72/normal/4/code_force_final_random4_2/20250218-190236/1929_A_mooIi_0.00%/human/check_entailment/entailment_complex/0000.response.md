Reasoning:  
The provided program does not actually solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`, after rearranging the elements of the array in any way. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as a space-separated string. This does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as required.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This is because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order, as the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, leading to the maximum possible sum of these differences.

Given this, the program is incorrect because it does not compute the required output.

Correctness: **False**
