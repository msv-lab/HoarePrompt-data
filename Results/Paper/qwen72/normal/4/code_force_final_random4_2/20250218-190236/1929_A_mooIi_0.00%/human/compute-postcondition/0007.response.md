Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) from 1 to `n`.
- `_` is 1.
- `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input list `a`.
- `t` must be greater than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This is a list of `n` integers, each within the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
2. **Sorted List**: The list `a` is sorted. Let's denote the sorted list as `sorted_a`.
3. **Map Object `ar`**: The map object `ar` is created by applying the `str` function to each element of the sorted list `sorted_a`. This means `ar` contains the string representations of the sorted integers.
4. **Joining the Elements**: The `join` method is used to concatenate the string representations of the sorted integers in `ar` with a space (' ') as the separator.
5. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement will output the concatenated string of the sorted integers.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the sorted integers from the list `a`, each converted to a string and separated by a space.

Output: **"sorted_a[0] sorted_a[1] ... sorted_a[n-1]" (where `sorted_a` is the sorted list of integers from `a`)**

For example, if `a` is `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]`, the sorted list `sorted_a` would be `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]`, and the output would be:
Output: **"1 1 3 4 5 9"**
