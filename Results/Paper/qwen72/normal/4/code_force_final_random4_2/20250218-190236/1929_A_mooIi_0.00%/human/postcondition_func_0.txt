The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 100`) and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list of integers, converts each integer to a string, and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the final state of the program is that `t` is an integer where `1 <= t <= 500`, `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, and `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the last input list.
