You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 100`) and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list of integers, converts each integer to a string, and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the final state of the program is that `t` is an integer where `1 <= t <= 500`, `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, and `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the last input list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, but it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output the sorted array `1 2 3` instead of the maximum beauty value.

The correct approach to solve this problem would involve calculating the maximum possible sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the elements. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty based on the sorted order. However, the program provided does not perform this calculation.
