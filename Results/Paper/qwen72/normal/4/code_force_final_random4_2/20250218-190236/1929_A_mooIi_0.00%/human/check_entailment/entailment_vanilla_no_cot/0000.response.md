Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The program sorts the input array and prints the sorted array, but it does not calculate or print the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem statement. The maximum beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array after rearranging the elements to maximize this sum. The program should instead calculate this sum and print it for each test case.
