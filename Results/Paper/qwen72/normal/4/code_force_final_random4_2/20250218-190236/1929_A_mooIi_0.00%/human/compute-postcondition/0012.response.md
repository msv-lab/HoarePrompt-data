Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `_` is `t-1`, `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range of 1 to 500.
- The value of `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9.
- The loop variable `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed `t` iterations.
- The variable `ar` will be a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input for the last iteration.
- The value of `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed, which is `t` itself.
