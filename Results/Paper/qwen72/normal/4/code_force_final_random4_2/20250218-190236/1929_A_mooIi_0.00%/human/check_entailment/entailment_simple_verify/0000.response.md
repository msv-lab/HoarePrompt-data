Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, but it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the elements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the beauty of the sorted array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
3. Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

The current program only sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not what the problem requires. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
