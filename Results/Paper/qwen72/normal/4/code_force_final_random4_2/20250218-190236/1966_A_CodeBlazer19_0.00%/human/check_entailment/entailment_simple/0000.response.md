Reasoning:  
The provided function `func` is incorrect. The function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of cards you can have left in your hand after performing the specified operations, but it simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without actually processing the list of cards `l` or considering the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`.

To solve the problem correctly, the function should:
1. Count the frequency of each card number in the list `l`.
2. Determine how many complete sets of `k` cards can be formed for each number.
3. Calculate the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder of the cards that cannot form a complete set of `k` cards and the possibility of exchanging them.

The current implementation does not perform any of these steps and always outputs `k - 1`, which is not the correct solution for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
