The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `l`. It then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is the total number of test cases processed, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the last input integers, and `l` is the last list of integers provided by the user.
