Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the operations.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the frequency of each card number and determine how many operations can be performed to minimize the number of cards. The correct approach involves calculating the remainder of the frequency of each card number when divided by `k` and using this information to determine the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        from collections import Counter
        freq = Counter(l)
        
        min_cards_left = n
        for count in freq.values():
            remainder = count % k
            if remainder > 0:
                min_cards_left = min(min_cards_left, remainder)
        
        print(min_cards_left)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the frequency of each card number and the remainder when divided by `k`. If the remainder is greater than 0, it means that after performing the operations, at least `remainder` cards will be left for that number. The minimum of these remainders across all card numbers gives the minimum number of cards left in the hand.
