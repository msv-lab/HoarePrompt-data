Output State: **`i` is `t-1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `n` and `k` are the last input integers, `l` is the last list of integers provided by the user.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The variable `t` remains the total number of iterations specified initially.
- The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last set of integers input by the user.
- The list `l` will contain the last set of integers provided by the user.
