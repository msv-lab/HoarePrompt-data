The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, both converted to integers. The initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**
