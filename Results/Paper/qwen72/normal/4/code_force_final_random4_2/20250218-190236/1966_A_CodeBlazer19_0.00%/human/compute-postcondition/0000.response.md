Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take a list of integers `c` representing the numbers on the cards, and two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `2 <= k <= 100`. The list `c` should have a length of `n` and each element should be an integer such that `1 <= c_i <= 100`. `t` is an input integer.**
