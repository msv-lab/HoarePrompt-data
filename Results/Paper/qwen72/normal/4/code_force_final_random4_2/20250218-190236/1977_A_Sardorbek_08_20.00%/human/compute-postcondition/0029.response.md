Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `q` is a tuple containing the new values of `b` and `c`. `b` and `c` are now the values provided by the user input, and their relationship (whether `b` == `c`, `b` < `c`, or `b` >= `c`) is updated based on the new values. If `a` and `b` have the same parity (both are either even or both are odd), the program maintains this condition. Otherwise, `a` and `b` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd).**
