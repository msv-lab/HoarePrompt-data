### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b == c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b < c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build a tower of height `c` because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 3**: `elif a % 2 == b % 2`
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, this is incorrect. The parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking the parity of `b` and `c` because the difference between `b` and `c` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.
   - **Case 4**: `else`
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "No". This is correct if the parity condition is fixed.

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be:
     - `if (b - c) % 2 == 0` or `if b % 2 == c % 2`
     - This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect must be an even number of changes to reach the desired height.

### Conclusion:
The program contains a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2`. The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2`.

### Correctness:
**False**
