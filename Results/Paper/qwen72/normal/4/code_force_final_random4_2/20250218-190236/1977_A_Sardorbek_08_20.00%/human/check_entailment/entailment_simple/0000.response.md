Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining if Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, representing `n` and `m` respectively.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve exactly `m` cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `a` (number of test cases) and `b` (number of moves) have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program prints 'Yes'. This condition is incorrect. The parity of `a` (number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking the parity of `b` and `c`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'No'. This is correct for the cases where `b` and `c` have different parities.

3. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition to check if Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is whether `n` and `m` have the same parity. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, so the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible.

4. **Fix:**
   - The line `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` should be replaced with `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`.

Given the incorrect condition in the program, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
