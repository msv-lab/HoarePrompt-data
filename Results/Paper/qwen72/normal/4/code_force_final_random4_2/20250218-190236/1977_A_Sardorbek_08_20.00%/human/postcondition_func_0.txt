The function `func` reads an integer `a` from user input, and for each integer from 0 to `a-1`, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from user input. It then checks the following conditions for each pair of `b` and `c`: if `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES'; if `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'; if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` mentioned in the annotations are not used or modified by the function. After the function concludes, `a` will be an integer between 0 and 100, and `q` will be a tuple containing the last values of `b` and `c` that were read.
