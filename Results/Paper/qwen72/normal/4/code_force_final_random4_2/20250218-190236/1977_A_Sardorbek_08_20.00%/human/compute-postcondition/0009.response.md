Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`. Additionally, `b` is not equal to `c`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.**
