Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the program is flawed in the following ways:

1. **Variable `a` vs. `t`**: The problem description mentions that `t` is the number of test cases, but the program uses `a` instead. This is just a naming discrepancy and does not affect the correctness of the logic.
2. **Condition for `b == c`**: If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the program correctly prints 'YES' because Nikita can achieve this by adding one cube per move.
3. **Condition for `b < c`**: If `b` is less than `c`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves made.
4. **Incorrect Parity Check**: The program checks if `a % 2 == b % 2` to determine if the result should be 'Yes' or 'No'. This is incorrect. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` because the parity of the number of moves (`b`) and the desired number of cubes (`c`) should match. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, it is possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.

Given the incorrect parity check, the program will produce incorrect results for some test cases. For example, in the test case `5 3`, the program should print 'Yes' because both 5 and 3 are odd, and it is possible to end up with 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., add 3 cubes, then remove 2 cubes).

Correctness: **False**
