Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by first reading the number of test cases (`a`), and then for each test case, it reads two integers (`b` and `c`).

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` equals `c`, the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves `n` is the same as the desired number of cubes `m`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to reach exactly `m` cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the number of moves `n` is less than the desired number of cubes `m`, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes since Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - If `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the function prints 'Yes'. This condition is incorrect. The correct condition should be checking if `b` and `c` have the same parity, not `a` and `b`. The parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` do not have the same parity, it is impossible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Output**: The function correctly outputs 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions, but the condition checking the parity is incorrect.

4. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variable `a` should be renamed to `t` to match the problem description. The variable `q` is not necessary and can be removed.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the wrong parity check and the misnamed variable `a`.

Correctness: **False**
