To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n-1`

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` translates to `1 < n-1`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 0, it is not guaranteed that `n` will be greater than 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `st` is an empty set.**
