Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`, `pos` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `pos` to -1. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_1()`. The list `arr` remains a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. No other variables are affected by the code.
