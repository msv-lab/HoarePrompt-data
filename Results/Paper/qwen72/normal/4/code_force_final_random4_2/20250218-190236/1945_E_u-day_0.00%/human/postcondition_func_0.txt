The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each part into an integer, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the sequence of integers.
