### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` are correctly implemented to read and parse the input. `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, while `func_2()` reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers. These functions are used appropriately within `func_3()`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` where `arr[pos] == x`. This is done correctly and ensures that `pos` is set to the correct index if `x` is found in `arr`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly. The program initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively, and then enters a loop where it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the value at `arr[mid]`.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which ensures that the search range is narrowed down to a single element.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low] == x` after the loop, the program outputs `0` (no swaps needed), which is correct.
   - If `arr[low] != x`, the program outputs `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions. This is also correct because it ensures that the element `x` is moved to the correct position where the binary search would find it.

5. **Handling Multiple Swaps:**
   - The problem description states that up to 2 swaps can be performed, but the program only performs 1 swap if `arr[low] != x`. This is not a limitation because the problem does not require minimizing the number of swaps, and 2 swaps are always sufficient. The program is designed to handle the case where a single swap is sufficient, which is often the case in permutations.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by outputting `0`.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by suggesting a single swap, which is sufficient for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
- The program is correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly identifies the position of `x` and performs a swap to ensure the binary search will find `x`. The program does not need to handle more than 1 swap in the given context, as it is not required to minimize the number of swaps.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
