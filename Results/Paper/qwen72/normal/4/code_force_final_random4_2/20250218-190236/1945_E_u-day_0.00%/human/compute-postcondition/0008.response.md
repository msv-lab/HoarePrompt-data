Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`, `pos` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pos` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1.
- The initial state variables `n`, `i`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- The condition about `arr[0]` being equal to `k` and `pos` being 0 or -1 is no longer relevant because `pos` is explicitly set to 1.
