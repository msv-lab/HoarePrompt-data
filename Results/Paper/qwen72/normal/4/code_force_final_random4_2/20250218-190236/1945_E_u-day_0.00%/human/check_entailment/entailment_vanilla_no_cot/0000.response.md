Correctness: **False**

The program provided is incorrect because it does not always correctly rearrange the permutation to ensure that the binary search will find the element `x` at the position `l` after the search. The program only attempts to swap the element at the final position `low` with the element `x` if `x` is not already at `low`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the permutation will be in a state where the binary search can correctly find `x` after at most 2 swaps.

For example, consider the permutation `[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]` and `x = 5`. The program will find `x` at index 3 and will end up with `low = 2` and `high = 3` after the binary search loop. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it will swap `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`, resulting in the permutation `[3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4]`. However, this permutation is still not sorted, and the binary search will not correctly find `x` at the position `l`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should ensure that the permutation is rearranged such that the binary search can find `x` correctly. This typically involves more complex logic to determine the correct swaps to make the permutation partially sorted around the target element `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break
    
    if pos == 0 or pos == n - 1:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Find the correct position for k using binary search
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    correct_pos = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == k:
            correct_pos = mid
            break
        elif arr[mid] < k:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    if correct_pos == pos:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Perform swaps to move k to the correct position
    swaps = []
    if correct_pos == -1:
        # If k is not in the correct position, find the correct position
        correct_pos = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[low] > k:
            correct_pos = low
        else:
            correct_pos = high
    
    if correct_pos != pos:
        # Swap k to the correct position
        swaps.append((pos + 1, correct_pos + 1))
        arr[pos], arr[correct_pos] = arr[correct_pos], arr[pos]
    
    # Ensure the permutation is partially sorted around k
    if correct_pos > 0 and arr[correct_pos - 1] > k:
        swaps.append((correct_pos + 1, correct_pos))
        arr[correct_pos - 1], arr[correct_pos] = arr[correct_pos], arr[correct_pos - 1]
    
    if correct_pos < n - 1 and arr[correct_pos + 1] < k:
        swaps.append((correct_pos + 1, correct_pos + 2))
        arr[correct_pos + 1], arr[correct_pos] = arr[correct_pos], arr[correct_pos + 1]
    
    print(len(swaps))
    for swap in swaps:
        print(swap[0], swap[1])

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the element `x` is moved to the correct position and that the permutation is partially sorted around `x` to allow the binary search to work correctly.
