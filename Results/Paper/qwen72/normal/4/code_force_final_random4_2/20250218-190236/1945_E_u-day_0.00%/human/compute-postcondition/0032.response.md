Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of the previous `mid` and the new value `mid`.**

Explanation:
- The code `st.add(mid)` adds the current value of `mid` to the set `st`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2` or `(n-1) // 2`.
- The set `st` now contains both the previous value of `mid` and the new value of `mid`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged.
