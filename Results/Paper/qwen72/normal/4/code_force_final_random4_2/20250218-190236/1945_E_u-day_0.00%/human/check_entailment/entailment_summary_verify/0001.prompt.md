You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid

            low = mid

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters but internally calls `func_1` to get `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to get `arr`. It searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`), and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - `func_3()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` where `arr[pos] == x`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the value at `arr[mid]`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low] == x` after the loop, it means the binary search would have found `x` correctly, and the program outputs `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low] != x`, the program outputs `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The binary search logic is correct in the sense that it will narrow down the search range to a single element.
  - However, the binary search assumes the array is sorted, which is not the case here. The program is designed to handle the unsorted permutation by allowing up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - If `arr[low] != x` after the binary search, the program suggests swapping the element at `low` with the element at `pos`.
  - This swap ensures that the element `x` is moved to the correct position where the binary search would find it.

- **Test Cases:**
  - The program processes multiple test cases correctly.
  - The output format matches the problem description, providing the number of swaps and the indices for the swaps.

### Issues:
- **Handling Multiple Swaps:**
  - The problem description states that up to 2 swaps can be performed, but the program only performs 1 swap if `arr[low] != x`.
  - This might be a limitation, but the problem also states that 2 operations are always sufficient, and the program is not required to minimize the number of swaps.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
  - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by suggesting a single swap.

### Conclusion:
- The program is correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly identifies the position of `x` and performs a swap to ensure the binary search will find `x`. The program does not need to handle more than 1 swap in the given context, as it is not required to minimize the number of swaps.

### Correctness:
**True**
