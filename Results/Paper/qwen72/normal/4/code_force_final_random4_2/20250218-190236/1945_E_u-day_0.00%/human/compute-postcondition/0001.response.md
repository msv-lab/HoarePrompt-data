Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates the variable `arr` to a list of integers that represents a permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain as they were updated by `func_1()`, and no other variables are affected.
