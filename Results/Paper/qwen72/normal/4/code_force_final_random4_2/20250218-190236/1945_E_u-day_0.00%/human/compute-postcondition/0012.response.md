Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `arr[0]` is equal to `k`, `pos` is 0. If `arr[1]` is equal to `k`, `pos` is 1. If `arr[2]` is equal to `k`, `pos` is 2. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.***
