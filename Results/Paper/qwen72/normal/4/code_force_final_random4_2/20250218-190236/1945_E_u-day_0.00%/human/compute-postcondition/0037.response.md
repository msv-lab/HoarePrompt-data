Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. `k` is found in `arr`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k`, and `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. `high` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just greater than `k` (or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`). `st` is a set containing the indices that were checked during the binary search process.**
