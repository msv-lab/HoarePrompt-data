Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.
3. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `A` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available numbers.
4. **Summing the Minimum Values**: After sorting, the program sums every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This is correct because in each move, the minimum value of the pair is added to the score, and by taking every second element from the sorted list, we ensure that we are always taking the smaller of the two numbers in each pair.
5. **Output**: The program prints the sum, which is the maximum possible score for the given test case.

The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
