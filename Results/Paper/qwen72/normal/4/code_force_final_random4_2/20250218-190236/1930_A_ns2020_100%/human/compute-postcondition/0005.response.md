Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer and must be non-zero (1 <= `t` <= 50).
- `n` is an input integer (1 <= `n` <= 50).
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `A`**:
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - The length of `A` is 2n, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.

2. **Slicing `A`**:
   - `A[::2]` is a slice of the list `A` that includes every second element starting from the first element (index 0).
   - For example, if `A` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, then `A[::2]` will be `[1, 3, 5]`.

3. **Summing the Sliced List**:
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of the elements in the sliced list `A[::2]`.

### Output:
The `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement will print the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A`, starting from the first element.

Since the exact values of the elements in `A` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) of the sorted list `A`.

Output: **sum of every second element in the sorted list `A` starting from the first element**
