Output State: **`t` is an input integer and `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `n` is the new input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `A`.
- The initial state specifies that `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. After executing the code, `A` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged and retain their initial properties and values.
