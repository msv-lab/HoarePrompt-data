The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`) and a list `A` of `2n` integers (each integer in the list satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^7`). The function sorts the list `A` and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0. The function does not return any value.
