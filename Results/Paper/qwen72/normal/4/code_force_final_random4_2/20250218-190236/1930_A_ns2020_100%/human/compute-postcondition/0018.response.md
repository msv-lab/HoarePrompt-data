Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `n` is the new input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1 again, so it is now `t - 2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
