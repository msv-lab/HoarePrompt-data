Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The key insight here is that to maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest number, and so on. This ensures that the minimum values are as large as possible, which maximizes the score.

The program works as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.
3. It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
4. It prints the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`.

The reason this approach is correct is because after sorting, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the smaller elements of each pair when the list is divided into pairs. By summing these elements, you are effectively summing the minimum values of each pair, which is the desired score.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `A = [2, 3]`
  - Sorted `A`: `[2, 3]`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Correct, as the only pair is (2, 3) and the minimum is 2.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `A = [1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted `A`: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Correct, as the pairs can be (1, 1) and (1, 2), and the minimum values are 1 and 1, respectively.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted `A`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
  - Output: `3`
  - Correct, as the pairs can be (1, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 1), and the minimum values are 1, 1, and 1, respectively.

The program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum score by sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
