Output State: **`t` is an input integer and `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `n` is now the input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
