The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Given the initial state, `ax` is initially 1000000007, and `x` is an input integer. The value of `ax` will be updated to the smaller of `x` and 1000000007.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a` is not equal to 1.**
