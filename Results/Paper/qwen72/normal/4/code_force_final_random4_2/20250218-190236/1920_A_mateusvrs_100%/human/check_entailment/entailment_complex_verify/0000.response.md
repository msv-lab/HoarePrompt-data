### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `t` to the number of test cases, which is within the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of constraints.
   - It initializes `cx` as a set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000007`) and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`), which are appropriate initial values for the minimum upper bound and maximum lower bound, respectively.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it reads `a` and `x`.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`. This correctly identifies the maximum lower bound.
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`. This correctly identifies the minimum upper bound.
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`. This correctly collects all the values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Determining the Range:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx > ax`. If true, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, indicating that no integer `k` can satisfy the constraints.
   - If `bx ≤ ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx`.

4. **Counting Excluded Values:**
   - It initializes `tmp` to `0` and iterates over the set `cx`.
   - For each value `i` in `cx` that falls within the range `[bx, ax]`, it increments `tmp`.
   - It then appends `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the result list `r`, which correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of excluded values from the total number of integers in the range.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element of the result list `r` on a new line, which is the correct format for the output.

### Validation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program correctly handles all constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.
- The program's logic aligns with the problem description and the constraints.
- The use of `max` and `min` to determine the bounds and the set `cx` to track excluded values is appropriate.
- The final calculation and output are correct.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program is correct and handles all the constraints as described in the problem statement.
- The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
