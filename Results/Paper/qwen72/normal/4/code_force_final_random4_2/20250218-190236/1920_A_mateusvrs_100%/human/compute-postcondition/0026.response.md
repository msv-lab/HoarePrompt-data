Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `bx` remains -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
- The variables `a` and `x` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- The conditions for `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain the same as in the initial state, but now `a` and `x` have specific values from the input. Therefore, the state of `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` will depend on the new values of `a` and `x` after the input.
