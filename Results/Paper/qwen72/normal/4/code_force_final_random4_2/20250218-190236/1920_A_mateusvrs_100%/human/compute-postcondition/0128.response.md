Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1. `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). `_` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t` and `n`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`a` and `x`**: These are input integers that are read in each iteration of the loop.
- **`cx`**: This is a set that contains all the unique integers `x` that were added to it during the loop when `a` was 3.
- **`ax`**: This is the minimum value of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2, or it remains 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered.
- **`bx`**: This is the maximum value of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1, or it remains -1 if no such `x` was encountered.
- **`r`**: This is a list that, after the loop completes, contains the integer 0 if `bx` > `ax`, or the integer `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx` â‰¤ `ax`, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).
- **`_`**: This is a loop variable that iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: This must be greater than 0, as it is the number of iterations the loop will run.
