Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all the integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `tmp` will contain the number of elements in the set `cx` that fall within the range defined by `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged from their initial state.
