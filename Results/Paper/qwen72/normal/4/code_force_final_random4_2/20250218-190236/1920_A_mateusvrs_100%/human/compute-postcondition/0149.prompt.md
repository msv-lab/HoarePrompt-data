You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. The constraints are given as pairs (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all unique integers `x` for which `a` was 3 across all test cases, `ax` is the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2 across all test cases, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists, `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1 across all test cases, or -1 if no such `x` exists, `r` is a list that now contains `t` integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case. For each test case, if `bx` > `ax`, the result is 0. If `bx` ≤ `ax`, the result is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) for that test case.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: Each element of the list `r` on a new line, where each element is calculated as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints `n` and pairs (a, x). It returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
