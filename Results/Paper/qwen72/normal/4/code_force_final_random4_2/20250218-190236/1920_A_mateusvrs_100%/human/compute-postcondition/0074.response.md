Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as integers greater than 0.
- `a` and `x` are now assigned the values of two input integers provided by the user.
- The value of `cx` remains either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`.
- `ax` remains 1000000007.
- `bx` remains the maximum of `x` and -1.
- The list `r` remains unchanged and may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions.
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
