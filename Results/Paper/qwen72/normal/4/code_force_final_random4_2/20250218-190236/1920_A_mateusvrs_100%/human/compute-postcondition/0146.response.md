Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all unique integers `x` for which `a` was 3 across all test cases, `ax` is the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2 across all test cases, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists, `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1 across all test cases, or -1 if no such `x` exists, `r` is a list that now contains `t` integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case. For each test case, if `bx` > `ax`, the result is 0. If `bx` ≤ `ax`, the result is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) for that test case.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` and `n`**: These variables remain integers greater than 0, as they are defined in the initial state and are used to control the loop.
- **`a` and `x`**: These are input integers that are read during each iteration of the inner loop.
- **`cx`**: This set contains all unique integers `x` for which `a` was 3 across all test cases. Each test case adds its own unique values to this set.
- **`ax`**: This variable holds the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2 across all test cases. If no such `x` exists, it remains 1000000007.
- **`bx`**: This variable holds the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1 across all test cases. If no such `x` exists, it remains -1.
- **`r`**: This list now contains `t` integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case. For each test case:
  - If `bx` > `ax`, the result is 0.
  - If `bx` ≤ `ax`, the result is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) for that test case.

The loop processes each test case independently, and the final state of `r` reflects the results of all `t` test cases.
