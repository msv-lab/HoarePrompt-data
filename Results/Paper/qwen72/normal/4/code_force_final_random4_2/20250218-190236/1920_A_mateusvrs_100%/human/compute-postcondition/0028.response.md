Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `bx` remains -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, and `cx` remain unchanged.
- The value of `bx` remains unchanged based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
