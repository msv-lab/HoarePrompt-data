Postcondition: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop and must have at least 1 integer, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `tmp` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `i` is the first integer in `cx`, and `i` is an integer that is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**
