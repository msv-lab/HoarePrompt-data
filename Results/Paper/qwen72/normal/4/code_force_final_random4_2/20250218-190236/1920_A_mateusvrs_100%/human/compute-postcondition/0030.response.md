Postcondition: ***`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers. If `a` is 2, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`, and `bx` remains -1. If `a` is not 2, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` remains -1 if `a` is 2, or `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` is 1, or `bx` remains -1 if `a` is neither 1 nor 2.***
