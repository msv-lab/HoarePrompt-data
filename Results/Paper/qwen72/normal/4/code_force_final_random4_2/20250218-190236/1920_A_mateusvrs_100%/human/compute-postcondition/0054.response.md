Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- `bx` is explicitly set to -1.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, `ax`, `r`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The conditions for `r` and `_` are not affected by the assignment of `bx` to -1, so they remain as described in the initial state.
