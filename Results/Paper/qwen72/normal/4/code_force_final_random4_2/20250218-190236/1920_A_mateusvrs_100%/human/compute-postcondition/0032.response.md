Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers. `cx` is a set containing all the integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2. `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered. `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered.**

Explanation:
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `a` and `x` are input integers that are read during each iteration of the loop.
- `cx` is a set that accumulates all the integers `x` for which `a` was 3 (or any value other than 1 or 2).
- `ax` starts at 1000000007 and is updated to the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2. If no such `x` is encountered, `ax` remains 1000000007.
- `bx` starts at -1 and is updated to the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1. If no such `x` is encountered, `bx` remains -1.
