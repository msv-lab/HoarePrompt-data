Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all unique integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists, `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `t` and `n` remain integers greater than 0.
- `a` and `x` remain the input integers.
- `cx` remains a set containing all unique integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2.
- `ax` remains the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists.
- `bx` remains the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists.
- `r` remains a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions.
- `_` remains `n - 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than `n - 1`.
- `bx` is still less than or equal to `ax`.
- `tmp` is now the count of unique integers in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive).
