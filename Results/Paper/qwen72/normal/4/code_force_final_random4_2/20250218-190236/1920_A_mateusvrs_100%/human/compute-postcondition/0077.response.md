Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**

The code `cx.add(x)` adds the integer `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was either an empty set or already contained `x`, after this operation, `cx` definitely contains `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
