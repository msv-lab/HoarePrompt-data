Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and will be automatically managed by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007.**

The value of `ax` is calculated as `1000000000.0 + 7`, which results in `1000000007`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
