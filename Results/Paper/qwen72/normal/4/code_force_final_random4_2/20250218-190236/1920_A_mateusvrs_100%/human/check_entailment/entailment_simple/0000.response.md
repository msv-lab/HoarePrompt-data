Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case. It also reads the constraints as pairs `(a, x)` and processes them accordingly.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is initialized as a set to store the values of `x` for which `a` is 3 (i.e., `k` must not be equal to these values).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`), which is effectively `1000000007`. This is used to track the smallest upper bound for `k`.
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1`, which is used to track the largest lower bound for `k`.

3. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For each constraint, if `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`. This ensures that `bx` is the largest lower bound.
   - If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`. This ensures that `ax` is the smallest upper bound.
   - If `a` is 3, `x` is added to the set `cx`. This set will contain all values that `k` must not be equal to.

4. **Range Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is the case, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, so the result is `0`.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`. This is done by:
     - Calculating the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1`.
     - Subtracting the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range (`tmp`).

5. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in the list `r`.
   - Finally, the program prints each element of `r` on a new line, which is the correct format for the output.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic is sound and the implementation matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
