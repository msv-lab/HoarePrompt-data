Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
     - Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - The highest possible value for each element in the matrix is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum of the matrix is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) // 6 \). This formula is incorrect for the problem. The correct formula should be \( n^3 \).
   - It prints the number of operations as \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it assigns the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to the row (Type 1 operation).
     - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it assigns the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to the column (Type 2 operation).

4. **Correctness of Operations:**
   - The operations are valid and within the allowed limit of \( 2n \).
   - However, the operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix. Assigning the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to both rows and columns will result in some elements being overwritten, leading to a suboptimal sum.

5. **Correct Solution:**
   - To maximize the sum, we should fill the matrix with the highest possible values, which is \( n \).
   - We can achieve this by performing \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's formula for the maximum sum is incorrect.
   - The operations performed do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
