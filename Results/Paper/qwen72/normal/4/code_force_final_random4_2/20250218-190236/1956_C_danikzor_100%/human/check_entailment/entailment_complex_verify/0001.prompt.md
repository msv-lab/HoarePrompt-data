You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle input and output for multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix. The function should ensure that the number of operations used does not exceed 2n for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer between 1 and 500)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. It prints two values: the first is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, and the second is `2 * n`. For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines: the first line starts with `1`, followed by `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1` in reverse order. The second line starts with `2`, followed by `i`, and then the same sequence of integers from `n` down to `1` in reverse order. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
     - Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - The highest possible value for each element in the matrix is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum of the matrix is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) // 6 \). This formula is incorrect for the problem. The correct formula should be \( n^3 \).
   - It prints the number of operations as \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it assigns the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to the row (Type 1 operation).
     - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it assigns the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to the column (Type 2 operation).

4. **Correctness of Operations:**
   - The operations are valid and within the allowed limit of \( 2n \).
   - However, the operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix. Assigning the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to both rows and columns will result in some elements being overwritten, leading to a suboptimal sum.

5. **Correct Solution:**
   - To maximize the sum, we should fill the matrix with the highest possible values, which is \( n \).
   - We can achieve this by performing \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's formula for the maximum sum is incorrect.
   - The operations performed do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
