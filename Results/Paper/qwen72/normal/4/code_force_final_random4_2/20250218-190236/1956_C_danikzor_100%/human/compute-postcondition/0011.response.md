Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all of its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`. This means that the loop has completed its execution for all values of `i` from 1 to `n`, inclusive.
