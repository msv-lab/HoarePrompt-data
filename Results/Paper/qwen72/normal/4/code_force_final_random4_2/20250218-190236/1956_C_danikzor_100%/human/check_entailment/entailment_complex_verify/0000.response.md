Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is indeed \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). This is because each row and each column will contain each integer from 1 to \( n \) exactly once, and the sum of the integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). Therefore, the total sum for the entire matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

However, the program's operations are correct in terms of achieving the maximum sum. The program performs \( 2n \) operations, where for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
- A Type 1 operation is performed on row \( i \), setting \( a_{i, j} \) to \( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \).
- A Type 2 operation is performed on column \( i \), setting \( a_{j, i} \) to \( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \).

These operations ensure that each row and each column contains the permutation \( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \), which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). This results in the matrix being filled with the maximum possible values, and the sum of all elements in the matrix is indeed maximized.

Despite the correct operations, the program prints an incorrect maximum sum. For example, when \( n = 2 \):
- The correct maximum sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 6 \).
- The program calculates the sum as \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 7 \), which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it prints the wrong maximum sum, even though the operations to fill the matrix are correct.

Final: **False**
