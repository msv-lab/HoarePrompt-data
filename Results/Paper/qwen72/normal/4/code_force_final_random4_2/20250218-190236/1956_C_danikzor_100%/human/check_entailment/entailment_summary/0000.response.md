Reasoning:

1. **Output Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the sum, `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, is correct for the maximum sum of the matrix. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers squared.
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers squared is `n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6`.
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, which results in the sum of all elements being `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program outputs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit of `2 * n` operations.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs two operations: one on the row and one on the column, both using the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

3. **Operation Validity**:
   - The operations are valid as they follow the problem constraints:
     - Type 1 operation: Assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to row `i`.
     - Type 2 operation: Assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to column `i`.
   - These operations ensure that each element in the matrix is set to the maximum possible value, which is `n`.

4. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case with the `func_1` function.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements:
     - The first line of each test case contains the maximum sum and the number of operations.
     - The subsequent lines describe the operations, with the correct format for each operation.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
