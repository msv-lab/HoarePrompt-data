Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant integer value. It will be printed as `1`.

2. **Second Argument: `i`**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is 3. It will be printed as `3`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(n, 0, -1)`**
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the sequence will be `[n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Combining the Output:
- The `print` function will print the constant `1`, followed by the value of `i` (which is 3), and then the unpacked sequence of integers from `n` down to 1.

### Final Output:
- The output will be a sequence of numbers starting with `1`, then `3`, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1.

Output: **1, 3, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1 (where n is the value of n and n >= 3)**
