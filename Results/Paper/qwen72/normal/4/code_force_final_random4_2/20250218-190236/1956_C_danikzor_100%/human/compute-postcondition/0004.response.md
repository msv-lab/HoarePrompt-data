Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument:**
   - The first argument in the `print` statement is the integer `2`.

2. **Second Argument:**
   - The second argument is the variable `i`, which is explicitly given as `1`.

3. **Third Argument:**
   - The third argument is the unpacked range `*range(n, 0, -1)`.
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(n, 0, -1)` will generate the sequence `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

### Combining the Arguments:
- The `print` statement will output the integer `2`, followed by the value of `i` (which is `1`), and then the sequence of integers generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be a sequence of integers starting with `2` and `1`, followed by the sequence from `n` to `1` in descending order.

### Example:
- If `n` is 5, the output will be: `2 1 5 4 3 2 1`.

### General Case:
- For any `n` greater than or equal to 1, the output will be: `2 1` followed by the sequence `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **2 1 [n, n-1, ..., 1] (where n is the value of n and the sequence is the descending sequence from n to 1)**
