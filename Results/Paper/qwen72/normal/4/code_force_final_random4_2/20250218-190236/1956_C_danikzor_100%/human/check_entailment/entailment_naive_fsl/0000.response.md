Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix for every potential case. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). The formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) does not match this expected sum.

For example, consider the case when \( n = 2 \):
- The correct maximum sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
- The program calculates the sum as \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 2 \times 3 \times 7 // 6 = 7 \), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
