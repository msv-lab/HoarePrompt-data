The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The loop starts with `i` being 1, and it will iterate up to `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
