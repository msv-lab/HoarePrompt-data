Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The function `func_1` is expected to handle input and output for multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix.
   - The function should ensure that the number of operations used does not exceed 2n for each test case.
   - `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```
   print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The first part of the print statement is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
     - This is a mathematical formula that calculates a specific value based on `n`.
     - The formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` squares, which is given by \( \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \).
     - However, the formula in the print statement is slightly different: \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \).
     - This formula will compute a value based on the input `n`.
   - The second part of the print statement is `2 * n`.
     - This simply multiplies `n` by 2.

4. **Output**:
   - The print statement will output two values: the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the result of `2 * n`.
   - Since `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, the exact numerical values will depend on the specific value of `n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer between 1 and 500)**
