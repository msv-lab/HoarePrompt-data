Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the size of the matrix.

2. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and their permutations, which is correct for the given problem.
   - It also prints `2 * n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit of no more than `2n` operations.

3. **Operations Execution**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, the program performs two operations:
     - A Type 1 operation on row `i` with the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1`.
     - A Type 2 operation on column `i` with the same permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1`.
   - These operations ensure that each row and each column of the matrix is filled with the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1`, which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

4. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The Type 1 operation assigns the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1` to the `i`-th row.
   - The Type 2 operation assigns the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1` to the `i`-th column.
   - Since each operation is performed on both rows and columns, the matrix will be filled with the maximum possible values, ensuring the sum is maximized.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the program correctly outputs `1 1` and performs one operation, which sets `a_{1,1} = 1`.
   - For `n = 2`, the program correctly outputs `7 4` and performs four operations, which fill the matrix as shown in the example.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic of the program is consistent with the problem statement and ensures that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum while adhering to the operation constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
