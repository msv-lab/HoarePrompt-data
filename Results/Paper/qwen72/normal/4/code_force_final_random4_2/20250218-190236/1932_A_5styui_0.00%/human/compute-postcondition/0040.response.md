Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `s` is 0.**

The value of `b` is updated to a new input string, and `j` is recalculated as the length of the new `b` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
