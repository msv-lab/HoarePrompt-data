Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the path, and a string s of n characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is guaranteed to be empty.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows:

```python
def max_coins(n, path):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and path is a string of n characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is guaranteed to be empty.**
