Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least one character, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, and the first character of `b` is '*'. If the string `b` is non-empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the string `b` has a second character and that character is '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
