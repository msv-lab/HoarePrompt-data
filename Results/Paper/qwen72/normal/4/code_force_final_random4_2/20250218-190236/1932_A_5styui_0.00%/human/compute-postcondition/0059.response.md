Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `j` is 1. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*' and the second character is also '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is '*' and the second character is not '*', the program continues as is.***
