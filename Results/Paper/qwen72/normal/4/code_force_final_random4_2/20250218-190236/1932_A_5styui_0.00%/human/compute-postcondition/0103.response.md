Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least 4 characters, `j` is 4, and `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution as normal.***
