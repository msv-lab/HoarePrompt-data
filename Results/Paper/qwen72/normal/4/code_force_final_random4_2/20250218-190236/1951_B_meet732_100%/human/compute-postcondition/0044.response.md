Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of at least 2 distinct integers within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns an integer based on the following conditions:
1. If there are fewer than two elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `k`, it returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
2. If there is exactly one element in `a` that is greater than the element at index `k` and this element's index is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
3. If there is exactly one element in `a` that is greater than the element at index `k` and its index is greater than `k`, it returns the index of this element minus 1.
4. If there is exactly one element in `a` that is greater than the element at index `k` and its index is less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of this element.
5. If there are exactly two elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `k` and the first element's index is 0, it returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`, where `ind[1]` is the index of the second element.
6. If there are exactly two elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `k` and `k` is greater than the index of the second element, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
7. If there are exactly two elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the index of the second element, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`. **
