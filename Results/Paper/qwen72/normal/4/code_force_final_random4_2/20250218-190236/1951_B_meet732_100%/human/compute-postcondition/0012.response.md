The value of `i` is appended to the list `ind`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9. `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` is a list containing the integer 1. `c` is either 1 or 2. `i` is 1. `n` is at least 2. If `c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
