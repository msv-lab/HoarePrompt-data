The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of at least 2 distinct integers, with each integer in the range from 1 to 10^9. The function returns different values based on the following conditions:

- **Case_1**: If the list `a` has `n` integers, the function returns `n - 1`.
- **Case_2**: If `x` is an integer in the list `a` and `k` is its index, the function returns `k - 1`.
- **Case_3**: If `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`, the function returns the index of the first element in `ind` minus 1.
- **Case_4**: If `k` is the index of `x` in the list `a`, and `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x` and is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
- **Case_5**: If `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is the index of `x` in the list `a`, the function returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
- **Case_6**: If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- **Case_7**: If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is the index of `x` in the list `a`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of at least 2 distinct integers within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns one of the following values based on the conditions: (1) `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of integers in `a`, (2) `k - 1`, where `k` is the index of `x` in `a`, (3) the index of the first element in `ind` minus 1, where `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x` and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`, (4) the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x` and is less than or equal to `k`, (5) the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`, where `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, (6) the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are the indices of the first and second elements in `a` that are greater than `x` and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, or (7) the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`.**
