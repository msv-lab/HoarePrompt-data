The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Since the state already specifies that `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute without needing to adjust `n`. However, `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9, `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`, `ind` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2**
