Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9. `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` is an empty list. `c` is 0. `i` is 0. `n` is at least 2. The integer at index `i` in the list `a` is greater than `x`.**
