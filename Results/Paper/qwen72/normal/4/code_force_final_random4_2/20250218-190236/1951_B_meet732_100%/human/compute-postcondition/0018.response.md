Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9. `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2 if `a[i] > x`, otherwise `ind` contains only the integer 1. `c` is 3 if `a[i] > x`, otherwise `c` remains 1 or 2. `i` is 2. `n` is at least 3. If `c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
