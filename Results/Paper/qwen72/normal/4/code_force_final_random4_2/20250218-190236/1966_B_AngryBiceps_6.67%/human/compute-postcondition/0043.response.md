Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing three strings (the original two strings plus the new input string), `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, and then concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 2, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, and then concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`.
- The initial state specifies that `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 1.
- After executing the code, `last_row` now includes the last character of the string in `a` at index 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
