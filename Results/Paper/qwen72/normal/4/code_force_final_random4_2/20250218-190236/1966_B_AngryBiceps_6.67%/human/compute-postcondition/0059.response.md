The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and is initialized to `n-1` before the loop starts. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must start from 0, not `n-1`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `last_row` is an empty string**
