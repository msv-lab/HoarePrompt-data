Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of a single repeated character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the condition `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]` is true. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` does not consist of a single repeated character, or the first string in `a` is equal to the last string in `a`, and either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
