Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing three input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second input value in `a` and the first character of the third input value in `a`, `i` is 2, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second input value in `a` and the last character of the third input value in `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the third input value in the list `a` to the existing `last_row`. The initial state specifies that `last_row` is the last character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second input value in `a`. After executing the code, `last_row` now includes the last character of the third input value in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
