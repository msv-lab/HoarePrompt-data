Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than 0.
4. `m` is a new input integer.
5. `a` is a list containing `n` input values.
6. `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` input values concatenated together.
7. `i` is `n-1`.
8. `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` input values concatenated together.
9. Either the length of the set of the first element of `a` is not 1, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
10. Additionally, either the length of the set of `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze what the `print('YES')` statement will output:

- The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly. They are constraints on the input values and the structure of the list `a` and the strings `first_row` and `last_row`, but they do not change the content of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
