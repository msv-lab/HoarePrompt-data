The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from stdin, where the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters ('W' or 'B') representing the initial colors of the grid. For each test case, the function outputs "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations, and "NO" if it is not possible.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, each containing a grid of characters 'W' or 'B'. It outputs "YES" for each test case if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color, and "NO" if it is not possible.**
