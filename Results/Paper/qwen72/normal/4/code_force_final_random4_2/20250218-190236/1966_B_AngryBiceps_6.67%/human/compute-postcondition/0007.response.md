Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**. 

The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the string in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. Since `a` contains one input string, `a[-1]` refers to that string, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that string. The other variables remain unchanged.
