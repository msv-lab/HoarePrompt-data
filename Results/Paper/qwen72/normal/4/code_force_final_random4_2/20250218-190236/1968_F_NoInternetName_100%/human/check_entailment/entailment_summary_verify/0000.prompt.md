You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict
#Function 1:
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

#Function 3:
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)

#Function 4:
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if result is not None:
        return result + 1
    return None

#Function 5:
def func_5():
    (n, q) = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a series of `q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). It computes a cumulative XOR list `x` of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point. It also maintains a dictionary `inds` where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`. For each query, the function checks if the cumulative XOR from the start up to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` and the smallest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
5 2
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
1 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
YES
NO
```

However, the program will output:
```
YES
YES
```

For the second query (1 3), the subarray is [1, 1, 2]. This subarray cannot be divided into more than one part where the XOR of each part is equal. Therefore, the correct answer should be "NO". The program incorrectly returns "YES" in this case.

The issue lies in the logic used to determine if the subarray is interesting. The program checks if `x[l - 1] == x[r]` or if there is a valid index in the `inds` dictionary that satisfies certain conditions. However, this logic does not correctly account for all possible ways to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR values.
