The code snippet `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` impacts the `inds` dictionary and the `x` list. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `x[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `x`.
2. `i` is the first element of the list `a`.
3. The last element of `x` is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, which is the XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the first element of `a`.
4. `inds` is a dictionary where the keys are the elements of `x` and the values are lists of indices where these elements appear in `x`.
5. `len(x) - 1` gives the index of the last element in the list `x`.
6. The code appends this index to the list in `inds` corresponding to the key `x[-1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30.
- `i` is the first element of `a`.
- `x` has a new element appended, which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.

The output state after executing the code snippet is:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30.
- `i` is the first element of `a`.
- `x` has a new element appended, which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.
- `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended, which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.**
