### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) can be split into \( k > 1 \) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
   - This can be simplified by checking if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero. If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. However, this is not the only condition. The subarray can also be interesting if there are indices within the subarray where the prefix XOR values match, allowing for a valid split.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search for Indices**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the indices where the prefix XOR values match.
   - `func_4` and `func_3` are helper functions that perform binary search to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the prefix XOR values match.
   - `func_4` returns the largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` plus 1, or 0 if no such index exists.
   - `func_3` returns the largest index in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program first checks if the XOR of the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) is zero by comparing `x[l-1]` and `x[r]`.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes" because the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it uses the binary search results to check if there are indices where the prefix XOR values match within the range. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the XOR of the subarray is zero by directly printing "Yes".
   - It also handles the case where the XOR is not zero by using binary search to check for matching indices.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient because it precomputes the prefix XOR array in \( O(n) \) time and uses binary search to handle queries in \( O(\log n) \) time.
   - The overall complexity is \( O(n + q \log n) \), which is suitable given the constraints.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - Correctly converts input strings to the specified type using `map`.
  - The state after the function call is accurate: it returns an iterator of the specified type.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - Implements a binary search to find the largest index where the predicate is `True`.
  - The state after the function call is accurate: it returns the largest index `l` where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True` or `None` if no such index exists.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
  - Simply calls `func_2` and returns its result.
  - The state after the function call is accurate: it returns the result of `func_2`.

- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
  - Calls `func_2` and returns the result plus 1 if the result is not `None`.
  - The state after the function call is accurate: it returns the result plus 1 or `None` if no such index exists.

- **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
  - Constructs the prefix XOR array `x` and the dictionary `inds` to store indices of prefix XOR values.
  - For each query, it correctly checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
  - If the XOR is not zero, it uses binary search to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the prefix XOR values match.
  - The state after the function call is accurate: it prints "Yes" if the subarray is interesting and "No" otherwise.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the constraints and edge cases.

Final: **True**
