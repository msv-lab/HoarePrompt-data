The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the result of applying `func_2` to `arr` and `predicate`. The exact return value depends on the implementation of `func_2` and the behavior of `predicate` when applied to `arr`. After the function concludes, the state of `arr` and `predicate` remains unchanged, and the program has the result of `func_2` applied to the provided arguments.
