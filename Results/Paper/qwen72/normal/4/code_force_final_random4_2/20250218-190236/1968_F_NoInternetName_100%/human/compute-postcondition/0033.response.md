Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the `continue` statement has been executed, and the loop or conditional block will proceed to the next iteration or step.**

Explanation:
- The code `lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]` updates the value of `lower`.
- `inds[x[r]]` is a list of indices where the element `x[r]` appears in `x`.
- `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` is a function call that returns the index of the first element in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `None` if no such element exists.
- If `func_4` returns an index, `lower` is set to the value at that index in `inds[x[r]]`.
- If `func_4` returns `None`, `lower` is set to 0.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
