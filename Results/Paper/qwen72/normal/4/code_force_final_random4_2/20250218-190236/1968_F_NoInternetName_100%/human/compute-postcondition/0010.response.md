Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the second element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended which is the result of `x[-2] ^ a[1]`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` appended to its list.** 

The code appends the current length of `x` minus 1 to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
