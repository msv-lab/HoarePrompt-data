You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) can be split into \( k > 1 \) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
   - This can be simplified by checking if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero. If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search for Indices**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the indices where the prefix XOR values match.
   - `func_4` and `func_3` are helper functions that perform binary search to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the prefix XOR values match.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) is zero.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes".
   - If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there are indices where the prefix XOR values match within the range to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the XOR of the subarray is zero by directly printing "Yes".
   - It also handles the case where the XOR is not zero by using binary search to check for matching indices.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient because it precomputes the prefix XOR array and uses binary search to handle queries, which is \( O(\log n) \) per query.
   - The overall complexity is \( O(n + q \log n) \), which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the constraints and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
