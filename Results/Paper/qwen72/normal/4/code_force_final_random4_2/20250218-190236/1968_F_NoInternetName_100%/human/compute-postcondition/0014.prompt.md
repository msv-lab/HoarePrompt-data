Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `q` are the integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`, `x` is a list containing a single integer 0, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `inds[0]` now contains the list `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended, which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the second element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended which is the result of `x[-2] ^ a[1]`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` appended to its list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the third element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended which is the result of `x[-2] ^ a[1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` appended to its list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
