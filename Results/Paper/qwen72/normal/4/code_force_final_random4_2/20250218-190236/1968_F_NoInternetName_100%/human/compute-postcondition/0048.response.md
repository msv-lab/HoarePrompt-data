Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `q` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `i` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are the values returned by the last call to `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0. If `upper` > `lower`, the loop or conditional block will proceed to the next iteration or step. If `upper` ≤ `lower`, the loop or conditional block will also proceed to the next iteration or step.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `q` iterations, the initial conditions for `n`, `a`, `x`, and `inds` remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `q - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed `q` iterations. The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values returned by the last call to `func_1(int)`. The variables `lower` and `upper` will be determined based on the last values of `l` and `r` as described in the loop body. The loop will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration based on the conditions `x[l - 1] == x[r]` and `upper > lower`.
