### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) can be split into \( k > 1 \) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
   - This can be simplified by checking if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero. If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search for Indices**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the indices where the prefix XOR values match.
   - `func_4` and `func_3` are helper functions that perform binary search to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the prefix XOR values match.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) is zero.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes".
   - If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there are indices where the prefix XOR values match within the range to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the XOR of the subarray is zero by directly printing "Yes".
   - It also handles the case where the XOR is not zero by using binary search to check for matching indices.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient because it precomputes the prefix XOR array and uses binary search to handle queries, which is \( O(\log n) \) per query.
   - The overall complexity is \( O(n + q \log n) \), which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the constraints and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
