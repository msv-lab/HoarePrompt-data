Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`.
2. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
4. `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
5. `q` is greater than 1.
6. `i` is 2.
7. `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
8. `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0.
9. `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'No'`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is hard-coded to print `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
