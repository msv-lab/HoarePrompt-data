Output State: **`n` and `q` are the integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`, `x` is a list containing a single integer 0, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The code initializes `inds` as a defaultdict where the default factory is a list. This means that `inds` will automatically create a list for any key that is accessed but not yet present in the dictionary. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
