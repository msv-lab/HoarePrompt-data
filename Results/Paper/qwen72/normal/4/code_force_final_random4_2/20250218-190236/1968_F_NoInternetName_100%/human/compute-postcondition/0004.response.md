Output State: **`n` and `q` are the integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`, `x` is a list containing a single integer 0, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `inds[0]` now contains the list `[0]`.**
