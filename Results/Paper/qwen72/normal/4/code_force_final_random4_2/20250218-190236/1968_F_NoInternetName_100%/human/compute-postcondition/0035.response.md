Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`.
2. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
4. `inds` is a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. Each key in `inds` is an element of `x`, and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
5. `q` is greater than 1.
6. `i` is 1.
7. `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
8. `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0.
9. `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0.
10. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the `continue` statement has been executed, and the loop or conditional block will proceed to the next iteration or step.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is not conditional on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It will always print `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, or `upper`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
