The code snippet `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends the result of the XOR operation between the last element of the list `x` and the variable `i` to the list `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` is between 0 and 2^30 - 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended, which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`**.
