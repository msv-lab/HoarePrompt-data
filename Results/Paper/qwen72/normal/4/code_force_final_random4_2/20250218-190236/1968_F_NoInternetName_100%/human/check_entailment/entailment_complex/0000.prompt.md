Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_5()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a callable that can convert a string to a specific type (e.g., int, float).
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element in the list of strings obtained by splitting the input. Each element in the iterator is the result of converting a string from the input to the specific type defined by `cast`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable `cast` and returns an iterator. This iterator applies the `cast` function to each element in a list of strings obtained by splitting a line of input provided by the user. The final state of the program is that it has an iterator where each element is the result of converting a string from the input to the specific type defined by `cast`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.

            r = mid
        
    #State: The loop will terminate with `l` and `r` such that `l + 1 == r`. The value of `l` will be the largest index in `arr` for which `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`, and `r` will be the smallest index in `arr` for which `predicate(arr[r])` is `False`. If no such indices exist, `l` will be the index of the last element for which `predicate` is `True`, and `r` will be the index of the first element for which `predicate` is `False`.
    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns the largest index `l` in `arr` for which `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. If no such index exists, it returns the index of the last element for which `predicate` is `True`.

The value of `l` will be the largest index in `arr` for which `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`, and `r` will be the smallest index in `arr` for which `predicate(arr[r])` is `False`. If no such indices exist, `l` will be the index of the last element for which `predicate` is `True`, and `r` will be the index of the first element for which `predicate` is `False`. Additionally, `predicate(arr[l])` is `False`.
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the largest index `l` in `arr` where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. If no elements in `arr` satisfy the predicate, it returns `None`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a boolean value.

    #The program returns the result of `func_2` applied to the list `arr` and the function `predicate`. The exact value depends on the implementation of `func_2` and the behavior of `predicate` when applied to `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the result of applying `func_2` to `arr` and `predicate`. The exact return value depends on the implementation of `func_2` and the behavior of `predicate` when applied to `arr`. After the function concludes, the state of `arr` and `predicate` remains unchanged, and the program has the result of `func_2` applied to the provided arguments.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
def func_4(arr, predicate):

    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the value of `result` plus 1 if `func_2(arr, predicate)` returns a non-None value. If `func_2(arr, predicate)` returns `None`, `func_4` returns `None`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a list of integers of length n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

If `upper` > `lower`, the loop or conditional block will proceed to the next iteration or step. If `upper` ≤ `lower`, the loop or conditional block will also proceed to the next iteration or step.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a series of `q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). It computes a cumulative XOR list `x` of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point. It also maintains a dictionary `inds` where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`. For each query, the function checks if the cumulative XOR from the start up to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` and the smallest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value.
