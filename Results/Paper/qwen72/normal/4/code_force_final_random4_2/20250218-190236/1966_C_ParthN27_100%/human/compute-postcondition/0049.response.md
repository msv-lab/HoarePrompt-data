The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the third element of `arr` is added to `s`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first three elements of `arr`, `i` is 2.**
