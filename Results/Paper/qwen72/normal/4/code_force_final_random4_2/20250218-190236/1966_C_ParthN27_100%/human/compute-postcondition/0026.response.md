Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
