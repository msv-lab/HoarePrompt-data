Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
