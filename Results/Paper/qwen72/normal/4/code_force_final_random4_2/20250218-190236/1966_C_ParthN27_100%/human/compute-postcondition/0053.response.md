Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is now a sorted list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends a 0 to the list `s`, which was initially a sorted list containing elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n-1`.
