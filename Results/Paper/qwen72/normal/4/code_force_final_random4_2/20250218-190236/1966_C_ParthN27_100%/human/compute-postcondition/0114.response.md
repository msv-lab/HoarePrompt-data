Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is a non-zero value. This means that there is at least one consecutive pair of elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) where the difference is 1, or the loop did not break early due to a difference greater than 1.**
