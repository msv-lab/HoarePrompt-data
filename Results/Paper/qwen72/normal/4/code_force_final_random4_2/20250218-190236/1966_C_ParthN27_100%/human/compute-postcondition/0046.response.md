The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `i` is 1**
