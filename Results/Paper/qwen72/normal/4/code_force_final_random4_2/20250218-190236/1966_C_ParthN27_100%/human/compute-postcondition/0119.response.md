Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is 2, then `i` is 1 and `ans` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if there is at least one consecutive pair of elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) where the difference is 1, or the loop did not break early due to a difference greater than 1. If `ans` is 0, it means there are no consecutive pairs of elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) where the difference is 1, and the loop did break early due to a difference greater than 1.***
