Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` for each test case, with an additional 0 at the beginning, and `ans` is 1 or 0 depending on the parity of the number of consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-1`) where the difference is exactly 1. If `n` is 2, the output is 'Alice'. If `n` is greater than 2, the output is 'Alice' if there is at least one consecutive pair of elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-1`) where the difference is 1, or the loop did not break early due to a difference greater than 1. If `ans` is 0, the output is 'Bob', indicating there are no consecutive pairs of elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-1`) where the difference is 1, and the loop did break early due to a difference greater than 1.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and for each test case, the list `s` contains all unique elements from the input list `arr` sorted in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning. The variable `ans` will be 1 if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-1`) where the difference is exactly 1, or if the loop did not break early due to a difference greater than 1. If `ans` is 0, it means there are no such consecutive pairs, and the loop did break early due to a difference greater than 1. The output will be 'Alice' if `ans` is 1, and 'Bob' if `ans` is 0. If the length of `s` is 2, the output will always be 'Alice'.
