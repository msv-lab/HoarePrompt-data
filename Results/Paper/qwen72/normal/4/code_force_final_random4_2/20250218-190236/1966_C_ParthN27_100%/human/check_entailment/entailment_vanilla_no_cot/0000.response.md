Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are exactly 1, which is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game. The correct approach involves understanding the game's strategy, which is based on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = sum(x % 2 for x in arr)
        if odd_count % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

Explanation:
- The game can be reduced to a simple parity check. If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
- This is because each move reduces the number of stones in all nonempty piles by the same amount, and the player who faces an even number of odd piles can always mirror the opponent's moves, ensuring they never lose.

The original program does not implement this logic and instead uses a set to sort and check the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes, which is incorrect for this problem.
