The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 3, `ans` is set to 1 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1**
