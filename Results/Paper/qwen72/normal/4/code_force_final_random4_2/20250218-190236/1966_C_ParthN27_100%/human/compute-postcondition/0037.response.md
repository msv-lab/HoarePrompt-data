Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is the length of the sorted list `s`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bob'`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, and `ans` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
   - The string `'Bob'` is a constant and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Bob**
