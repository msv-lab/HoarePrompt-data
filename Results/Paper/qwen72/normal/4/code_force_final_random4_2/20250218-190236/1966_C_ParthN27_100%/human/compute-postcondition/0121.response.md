The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `piles`, where each inner list contains integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The parameter `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the winner of a game where two players take turns removing stones from the piles. The player who removes the last stone wins the game. The function returns "First" if the first player wins, and "Second" if the second player wins.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. It returns a list of strings, where each string is "First" if the first player wins the game for the corresponding test case, and "Second" if the second player wins.**
