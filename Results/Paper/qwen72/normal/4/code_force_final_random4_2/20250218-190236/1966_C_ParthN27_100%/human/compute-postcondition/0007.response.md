Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
- The set `s` now contains both `arr[i-1]` (the element it already had) and `arr[i]` (the new element added).
- The conditions that `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, and `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user remain unchanged.
