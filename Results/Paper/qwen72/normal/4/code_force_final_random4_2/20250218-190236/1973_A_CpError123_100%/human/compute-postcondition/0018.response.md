The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. The loop is controlled by the range of `t`, and the variable `_` is the loop counter. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly used, it is incremented by 1 for each iteration, but its value is not relevant to the loop's continuation condition. The loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 1 (since one iteration has already occurred).

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
