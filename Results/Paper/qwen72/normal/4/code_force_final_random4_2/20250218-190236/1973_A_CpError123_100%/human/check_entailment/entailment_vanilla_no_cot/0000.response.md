Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the total number of points and checking if it's even. However, the logic to determine the maximum number of draws is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total points `(a + b + c)` are even. If the total points are odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`.
   - It then prints `min(x, y)` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This logic is incorrect because it doesn't consider the constraints of the problem correctly.

### Correct Approach:

To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:

- Each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (a draw).
- The total number of points must be even.
- The maximum number of draws is the number of points that can be distributed as draws without violating the scores.

The correct logic should be:

1. **Check if the total points are even**:
   - If `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0`, print `-1`.

2. **Calculate the total number of games**:
   - The total number of games played is `(a + b + c) // 2`.

3. **Determine the maximum number of draws**:
   - The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the number of wins.
   - The number of wins is the total points minus the number of draws, which must be an even number.
   - The maximum number of draws is `min((a + b + c) // 2, a + b)`.

However, the program should also ensure that the scores are consistent with the number of wins and draws. Specifically, the scores should be such that the difference between the highest and lowest scores is not too large to be explained by the number of games and draws.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = a + b + c
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_wins = c - a  # The maximum number of wins by the highest scorer
        if max_wins > total_games:
            print(-1)
            continue
        max_draws = total_games - max_wins
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Total Points Check**: If the total points are odd, print `-1`.
- **Total Games Calculation**: The total number of games is `total_points // 2`.
- **Max Wins Calculation**: The maximum number of wins by the highest scorer is `c - a` (since the highest scorer can have at most `c - a` more wins than the lowest scorer).
- **Consistency Check**: If the maximum number of wins is greater than the total number of games, print `-1` because it's impossible.
- **Max Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the maximum number of wins.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
