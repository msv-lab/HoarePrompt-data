Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user.
- `x` is calculated as \((a + b + c) // 2\).
- `y` is calculated as \(a + b\).
- If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
- The condition about the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` being odd and skipping the current iteration of the loop does not affect the `print` statement, as the `print` statement itself does not depend on these variables or conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print `-1` regardless of the values of the variables or the condition about the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **-1**
