Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`. The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` must be even for the current iteration to continue.** 

In this output state, the value of `y` is updated to `a + b`. All other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain unchanged, including the constraints on `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, the requirement that `t` is greater than 1, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x`. The program continues only if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even.
