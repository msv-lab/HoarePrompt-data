The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a constant integer value `-1`.
- The initial state describes several variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Since the `print` statement is printing a constant value, the output will always be `-1` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
