Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the scores `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points in any set of games (with or without draws) must be even. Each game contributes either 2 points (in a win/loss scenario) or 2 points (in a draw), so an odd sum is impossible.

3. **Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the maximum number of games that could have been played, assuming all games ended in draws.
   - `y` is calculated as `a + b`. This represents the number of games where the third player (with score `c`) could have been involved in draws.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is intended to represent the maximum number of draws that could have occurred. However, this logic is flawed:
   - If `x` is the total number of games (assuming all games are draws), and `y` is the number of games where the third player could have been involved in draws, the minimum of these two values does not necessarily give the correct number of draws.
   - The correct approach should be to ensure that the scores are consistent with the possible outcomes of games (win/loss or draw) and then calculate the maximum number of draws.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The total number of points `a + b + c` must be even.
   - The maximum number of draws `d` can be calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2 - (c - a)`.
   - This formula ensures that the points are distributed correctly and accounts for the possibility of draws.

Given the above reasoning, the program's logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
