Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `i`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged.
- `n` and `k` are now assigned the values of the two integers provided by the user input.
- The condition regarding the maximum value in `p` and `k` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
