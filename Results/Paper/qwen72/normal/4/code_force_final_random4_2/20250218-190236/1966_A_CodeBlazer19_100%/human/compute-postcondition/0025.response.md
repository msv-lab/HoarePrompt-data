The function `func` should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `n` is an integer representing the number of cards, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange, with the constraint 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. `c` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the number on a card, with the constraint 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each integer `c_i` in the list.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters:
- Case_1: If `t` is outside the range 1 to 500, the function returns an error message indicating that the number of test cases is invalid.
- Case_2: If `n` or `k` are outside their respective ranges, the function returns an error message indicating that the number of cards or the number of cards to exchange is invalid.
- Case_3: If any integer `c_i` in the list `c` is outside the range 1 to 100, the function returns an error message indicating that the card numbers are invalid.
- Case_4: If all input parameters are valid, the function processes the list `c` and returns a result based on the number of test cases `t`, the number of cards `n`, the number of cards to exchange `k`, and the list of card numbers `c`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. It returns an error message if `t` is not between 1 and 500, or if `n` or `k` are not within their respective valid ranges, or if any card number in `c` is not between 1 and 100. If all parameters are valid, it processes the list of card numbers and returns a result based on the input parameters.**
