Reasoning:  
The program provided has a few issues that affect its correctness:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func()` does not accept any parameters. This means it is not designed to be called with the necessary inputs (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`). Instead, it reads the inputs directly from `input()`. While this works for the given context, it is not a good practice and does not align with the typical function design for such problems. A more appropriate function definition would be `def func(t, n, k, c):`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**: The logic inside the function is incorrect. The program checks if the maximum count of any card number in the list `l` is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `k - 1`, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as many times as possible. This involves repeatedly removing `k` cards and adding `k-1` cards until no more operations can be performed.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed, as mentioned above.

4. **Output**: The program should output the minimum number of cards left for each test case, but the current logic does not achieve this correctly.

To fix the program, we need to implement a correct algorithm to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. One way to do this is to use a greedy approach where we repeatedly perform the operation on the most frequent card numbers until no more operations can be performed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each card number
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
        min_cards = n
        for count in p:
            # Calculate the number of operations we can perform on this card number
            operations = count // k
            # Calculate the number of cards left after performing these operations
            cards_left = count - operations * (k - 1)
            min_cards = min(min_cards, cards_left)
        
        print(min_cards)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

However, the above logic is still not optimal. A more efficient approach is to use the formula to calculate the minimum number of cards left directly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each card number
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
        min_cards = n
        for count in p:
            # Calculate the number of cards left after performing the operations
            cards_left = count % (k - 1)
            if cards_left == 0:
                cards_left = k - 1
            min_cards = min(min_cards, cards_left)
        
        print(min_cards)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:
