Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`.
   - If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(n)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(n)` statement will print the value of the variable `n`.
   - The value of `n` is an input integer, which means it is provided by the user and can be any integer.
   - The initial state does not provide any specific value for `n`, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `n` is an input integer, the output will be the value of `n` as provided by the user.

Output: **n (where n is the value of the input integer n)**
