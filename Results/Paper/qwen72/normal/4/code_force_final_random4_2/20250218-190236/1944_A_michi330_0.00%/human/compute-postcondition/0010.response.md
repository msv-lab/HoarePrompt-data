The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply outputs the integer `1`. The variables `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the integer `1` regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **1**
