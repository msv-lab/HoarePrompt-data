The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function retains the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function also retains the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k`.**
