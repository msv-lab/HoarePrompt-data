Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `pair_idx` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pair_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `pair_idx`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_item_idx`, and `ans1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `pair_idx` and retains the initial state of the other variables.
