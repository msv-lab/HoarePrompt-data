Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed in its approach to finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. The program attempts to find the maximum value in the permutation and then tries to find another index that maximizes the XOR with this maximum value. However, this approach does not guarantee that the XOR value is maximized for all possible permutations.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the permutation `p = [0, 1, 2, 3]` for `n = 4`.

1. **First Loop (Finding `max_item_idx`):**
   - `max_item_idx` starts at 0.
   - `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)` returns `<` because `0 < 1`, so `max_item_idx` becomes 1.
   - `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)` returns `<` because `1 < 2`, so `max_item_idx` becomes 2.
   - `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)` returns `<` because `2 < 3`, so `max_item_idx` becomes 3.

2. **Second Loop (Finding `pair_idx`):**
   - `pair_idx` starts at 3.
   - `func_1(3, 3, 3, 0)` returns `>` because `3 > 0`.
   - `func_1(3, 3, 3, 1)` returns `>` because `3 > 1`.
   - `func_1(3, 3, 3, 2)` returns `>` because `3 > 2`.
   - `func_1(3, 3, 3, 3)` returns `=` because `3 == 3`.

The program will output `! 3 3`, which is incorrect because `p_3 ⊕ p_3 = 3 ⊕ 3 = 0`, and the maximum XOR value for this permutation is `3 ⊕ 0 = 3`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a divide-and-conquer strategy or a more detailed exploration of the permutation to ensure that the maximum XOR value is found. The current program does not handle all edge cases and permutations correctly, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.
