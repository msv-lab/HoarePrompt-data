Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
    if ans1 == '<':
        pair_idx = i
    elif ans1 == '=':
        ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
        if ans2 == '>':
            pair_idx = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0)`. If `ans1` is '<', `pair_idx` is set to 0. If `ans1` is '=', then if `ans2` is '>', `pair_idx` is set to 0; otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is neither '<' nor '=', `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is set to 1. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is set to 1 if `ans2` is '>', otherwise `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is neither '<' nor '=', `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx` and `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is set to 2. If `ans1` is not '<' and `ans1` is '=', and `ans2` is '>', then `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged and `pair_idx` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
