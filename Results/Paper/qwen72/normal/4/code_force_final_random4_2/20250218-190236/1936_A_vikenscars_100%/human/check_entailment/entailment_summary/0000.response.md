### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices `i` and `j` in a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
   - We can make at most `3n` queries of the form `? a b c d` to get the comparison result of `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives the comparison result.
   - It correctly formats the query and handles the input/output as required by the problem.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **First Loop:**
     - The function initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
     - It iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` and queries `? max_item_idx max_item_idx i i`.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
     - This loop aims to find the index `max_item_idx` such that `p_max_item_idx` is the maximum value in the permutation. This is because `p_a | p_b` will be maximized when `p_a` and `p_b` are the same and equal to the maximum value in the permutation.
   - **Second Loop:**
     - The function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It iterates over all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and queries `? max_item_idx pair_idx max_item_idx i`.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
     - If the result is `=`, it makes an additional query `? pair_idx pair_idx i i` to determine if `p_i` is greater than `p_pair_idx` and updates `pair_idx` if necessary.
     - This loop aims to find the index `pair_idx` such that `p_max_item_idx ⊕ p_pair_idx` is maximized. The idea is to compare the bitwise OR of `p_max_item_idx` with different values of `p_i` to find the pair that maximizes the XOR.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
   - The second loop makes at most `2n` queries (one for each `i` and potentially one additional query for each `i`).
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is `n-1 + 2n = 3n-1`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result in the required format `! max_item_idx pair_idx`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem by finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, and they do so within the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
