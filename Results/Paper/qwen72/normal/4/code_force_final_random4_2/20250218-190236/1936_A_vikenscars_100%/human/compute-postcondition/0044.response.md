Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `pair_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or the last index `i` for which `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` returned '>' if `ans1` was '='.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations.
- The variable `i` has reached the final value of `n-1`.
- `max_item_idx` is the index where `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time during the loop execution. If `func_1` never returned '<', then `max_item_idx` remains 0.
- `pair_idx` is the index where `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` returned '<' for the last time. If `func_1` never returned '<' and `ans1` was '=', then `pair_idx` is the last index `i` where `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` returned '>'. If neither of these conditions were met, `pair_idx` retains its initial value or the value it was set to during the loop execution.
