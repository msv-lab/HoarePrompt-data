Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.** 

The value of `pair_idx` is now equal to the value of `max_item_idx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
