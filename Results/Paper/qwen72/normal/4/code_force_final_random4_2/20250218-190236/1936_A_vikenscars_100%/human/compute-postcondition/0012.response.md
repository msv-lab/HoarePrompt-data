Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 3, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and `max_item_idx` is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `max_item_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `max_item_idx`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_item_idx` and retains the initial state of the other variables.
