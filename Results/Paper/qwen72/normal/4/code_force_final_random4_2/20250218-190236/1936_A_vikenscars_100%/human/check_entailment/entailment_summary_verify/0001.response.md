### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries, where each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` sends a query to the interactor and returns the result of the comparison between \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).
   - This function is used to make the actual queries and receive the responses.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n)` is the main function that solves the problem for a given \( n \).
   - **Step 1: Finding the Maximum Element:**
     - The function initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
     - It iterates over all indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and uses `func_1` to compare \( (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{max_item_idx}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \).
     - If the result is '<', it updates `max_item_idx` to \( i \).
     - This step ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
     - **Note:** The bitwise OR of an element with itself is the element itself. Therefore, this step is effectively finding the maximum element in the permutation.

   - **Step 2: Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
     - The function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It iterates over all indices from 0 to \( n-1 \) and uses `func_1` to compare \( (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) \) with \( (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i) \).
     - If the result is '<', it updates `pair_idx` to \( i \).
     - If the result is '=', it further compares \( (p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) to ensure that `pair_idx` is the correct index.
     - This step is intended to find the index `pair_idx` such that \( p_{max_item_idx} \oplus p_{pair_idx} \) is maximized.
     - **Note:** The logic here is flawed. The comparison \( (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) \) with \( (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i) \) does not directly help in finding the maximum XOR. The maximum XOR is not necessarily related to the maximum OR value.

4. **Output:**
   - After identifying the indices, the function prints the result in the format `! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}`.
   - This output is not considered a query and does not count towards the query limit.

5. **Query Limit:**
   - The function makes \( n-1 \) queries to find the maximum element.
   - It then makes \( n \) queries to find the pair with the maximum XOR.
   - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n = 2n - 1 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will find the maximum element and then the pair with the maximum XOR in a straightforward manner.
   - However, for larger values of \( n \), the logic in Step 2 is flawed and may not always find the correct pair with the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program does not correctly identify the indices that maximize the XOR operation. The logic in Step 2 of `func_2` is flawed because it relies on the maximum OR value, which is not a reliable indicator for maximizing the XOR value.

Final: **False**
