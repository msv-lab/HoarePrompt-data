### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can use a maximum of 3n queries to achieve this.
   - Each query involves four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and returns a comparison of \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b, c, d)`**
   - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives the result.
   - It constructs the query string and prints it with `flush=True` to ensure it is sent immediately.
   - It then reads the input from the interactor and returns it.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n)`**
   - **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
     - The function starts by assuming the first index (0) as the maximum item index.
     - It iterates through all other indices (1 to n-1) and uses a query to compare the bitwise OR of the current maximum item with itself and the bitwise OR of the current index with itself.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates the maximum item index to the current index.
     - This step ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation \(p\).

   - **Finding the Pair Index:**
     - After finding `max_item_idx`, the function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It then iterates through all indices (0 to n-1) again.
     - For each index \(i\), it compares the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` with the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and \(i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - If the result is `=`, it further compares the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself and the bitwise OR of \(i\) with itself.
     - If the result of this second comparison is `>`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - This step ensures that `pair_idx` is the index that, when XORed with `max_item_idx`, gives the maximum possible value.

4. **Output:**
   - After determining `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, the function prints the answer in the required format `! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}`.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The function uses \(n-1\) queries to find `max_item_idx`.
   - It then uses \(n\) queries to find `pair_idx`.
   - The total number of queries is \(2n-1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly follows the problem's constraints and logic. It efficiently finds the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.

**Correctness: True**
