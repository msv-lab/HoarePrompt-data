Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that could lead to incorrect results:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are used to represent the coordinates of Alice's and Bob's chips, but the program does not consistently use these variables in a way that aligns with the problem description. Specifically, `a` and `b` should represent Alice's chip coordinates, and `c` and `d` should represent Bob's chip coordinates. However, the program seems to mix these up in some places.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Draw Condition**: The logic for determining a draw is flawed. The program checks if `a > c` (i.e., if Alice's chip is below Bob's chip), but this is not sufficient to determine a draw. A draw can occur if either Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, or if they cannot move into the same cell.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Possible Moves**: The program calculates the possible range of moves for Alice and Bob using `x = abs(a - c) // 2`, but this calculation is not correct. The number of moves Alice or Bob can make is not necessarily half the distance between their current positions.

4. **Incorrect Win Condition**: The win condition for Alice and Bob is not correctly implemented. The program uses `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])` and `print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])`, which are not accurate for determining if Alice or Bob can win.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
        if x_a == h or x_b == 1:
            print("Draw")
        else:
            # Calculate the number of moves until they meet in the same row
            moves = (x_b - x_a) // 2
            
            # Check if Alice can win
            if (x_b - x_a) % 2 == 1:
                # Alice can win if she can move to Bob's current column in the next move
                if abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves + 1:
                    print("Alice")
                else:
                    print("Draw")
            else:
                # Bob can win if he can move to Alice's current column in the next move
                if abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves:
                    print("Bob")
                else:
                    print("Draw")

func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the conditions for a draw, Alice's win, and Bob's win based on the number of moves and the relative positions of the chips.
