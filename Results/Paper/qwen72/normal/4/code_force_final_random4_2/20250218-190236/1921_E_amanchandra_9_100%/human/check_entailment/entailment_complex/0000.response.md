### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input.

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The function checks if `a` (Alice's row) is greater than `c` (Bob's row). If this is true, it immediately prints "Draw". This is correct because if Alice starts below Bob, she cannot reach Bob's row before Bob reaches her row, and vice versa, leading to a draw.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `x` as the integer division of `abs(a - c)` by 2. This is the number of turns it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet if they move optimally.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If `abs(a - c)` is odd, the function calculates `l` and `r` as the possible range of columns where Bob's chip could be after `x` turns.
   - It then checks if Alice's chip can be within this range after `x + 1` turns. If so, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - This logic is correct because if the distance between Alice and Bob is odd, Alice will have one more turn to potentially catch Bob.

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If `abs(a - c)` is even, the function calculates `l` and `r` as the possible range of columns where Alice's chip could be after `x` turns.
   - It then checks if Bob's chip can be within this range after `x` turns. If so, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - This logic is correct because if the distance between Alice and Bob is even, Bob will have the same number of turns as Alice to potentially catch her.

6. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The function ensures that the calculated `l` and `r` values do not go beyond the board boundaries by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`.
   - This is necessary to avoid invalid moves.

7. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct outcome for each test case based on the conditions described.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
