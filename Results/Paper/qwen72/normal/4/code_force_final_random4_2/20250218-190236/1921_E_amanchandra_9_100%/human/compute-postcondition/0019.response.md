The print statement in the given code snippet is simply printing the string 'Draw'. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement. Therefore, the output will be the string 'Draw' as it is.

Output: **Draw**
