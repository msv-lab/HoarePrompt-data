Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
4. `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.
5. `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
6. `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`**:
   - `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - \( x = \left\lfloor \frac{|a - c|}{2} \right\rfloor \)

2. **Calculate `l`**:
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
   - \( l = \max(1, d - x) \)

3. **Calculate `r`**:
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
   - \( r = \min(w, d + x) \)

4. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - The condition in the print statement is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - This condition checks if both `l` and `r` are within `x + 1` of `b`.

5. **Determine the Output**:
   - If the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is `True`, the print statement will output `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is `False`, the print statement will output `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output either `Draw` or `Alice` based on the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `w` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `l`, and `r`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **Draw or Alice (where the output is determined by the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`)**
