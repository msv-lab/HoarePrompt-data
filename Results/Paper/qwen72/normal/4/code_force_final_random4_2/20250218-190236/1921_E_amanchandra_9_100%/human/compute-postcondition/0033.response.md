Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is calculated as the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
- `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
