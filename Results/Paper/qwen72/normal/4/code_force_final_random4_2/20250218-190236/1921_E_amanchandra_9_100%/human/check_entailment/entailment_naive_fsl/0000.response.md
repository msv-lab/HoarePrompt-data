Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
10 10 1 6 10 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
In this test case, Alice starts at (1, 6) and Bob starts at (10, 8). Alice can move her chip to (2, 5), (2, 6), or (2, 7). Bob can move his chip to (9, 7), (9, 8), or (9, 9). If Alice moves to (2, 7), Bob can move to (9, 7). Alice can then move to (3, 6), (3, 7), or (3, 8). Bob can move to (8, 6), (8, 7), or (8, 8). If Alice moves to (3, 8), Bob can move to (8, 8). Alice can then move to (4, 7), (4, 8), or (4, 9). Bob can move to (7, 7), (7, 8), or (7, 9). If Alice moves to (4, 9), Bob can move to (7, 9). Alice can then move to (5, 8), (5, 9), or (5, 10). Bob can move to (6, 8), (6, 9), or (6, 10). If Alice moves to (5, 10), Bob can move to (6, 10). Alice can then move to (6, 9), (6, 10), or (6, 11). Bob can move to (5, 9), (5, 10), or (5, 11). If Alice moves to (6, 10), Bob can move to (5, 10), and Alice wins because she can move to (7, 9), (7, 10), or (7, 11) on her next turn, and Bob cannot move to (7, 10) without losing.

However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this case. The logic in the program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and the optimal moves for both players, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.
