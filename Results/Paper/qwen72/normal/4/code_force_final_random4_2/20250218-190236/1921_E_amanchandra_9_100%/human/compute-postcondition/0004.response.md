The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.
- `a` is greater than `c`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables, it will simply print the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
