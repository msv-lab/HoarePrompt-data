Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `_` remains 1.
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are still integers provided by the user.
- `x` is still the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
- `l` is now assigned the value of the maximum between 1 and `d - x`. This means `l` will be at least 1, or `d - x` if `d - x` is greater than 1.
