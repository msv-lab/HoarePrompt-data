Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user. If `a` > `c`, no changes are made to the variables. If `a` â‰¤ `c`, `x` is set to `(c - a) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)`.***
