Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (i.e., `a - c` is odd), `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. Otherwise, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.***
