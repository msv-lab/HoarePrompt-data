The code snippet `x = abs(a - c) // 2` calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, divides it by 2, and assigns the result to `x`. Given that `a` is less than or equal to `c`, the absolute difference `abs(a - c)` is equivalent to `c - a`. Dividing this by 2 gives `x` the value of `(c - a) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is `(c - a) // 2`**.
