The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k // 2`. If `i` is less than `k // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is at least 2, which means `k // 2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be at least 2 to ensure `k // 2` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, and `i` is 1**
