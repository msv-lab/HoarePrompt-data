An exception could occur in the `try` block when attempting to access or modify elements of the list `a` at indices `g` or `d`. Specifically, if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`, or if the elements at these indices are not integers, a `TypeError` or `IndexError` could be raised. The `except` block catches any such exceptions and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unchanged.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If the value at `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the value at `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. However, if an exception occurs, the `except` block ensures that the program breaks out of the loop or if statement, and no changes are made to the variables.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If no exception occurs, the integer at index `g` in `a` is now `int(a[g]) - 1`, and the integer at index `d` in `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is now `d - 1`. If `a[g]` is 0, then `g` is now `g + 1`. If an exception occurs, all variables remain unchanged.**
