An exception in the `try` block could occur at the points where the list `a` is being accessed and modified, specifically at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. These operations could raise an `IndexError` if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`, or a `ValueError` if the elements at `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to an integer.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the first and last elements of the list `a` by 1. If the first element becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the last element becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any exception occurs during these operations, the `except` block will execute and break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input. If no exception occurs, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, and the last element of `a` is now the last element of `a` minus 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, `g` is 1. If the last element of `a` is 0, `d` is the length of `a` minus 2. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of `a`, `g`, and `d` remains unchanged from their initial values.**
