The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `k`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `k` is such that `i < k // 2`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new state for `i` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must be less than `k // 2`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be such that `i + 1 < k // 2`**
