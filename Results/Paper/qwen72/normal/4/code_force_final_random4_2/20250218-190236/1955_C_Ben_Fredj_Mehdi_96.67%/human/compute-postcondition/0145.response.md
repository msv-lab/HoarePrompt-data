Output: **8**

Explanation:
The `print` statement in the given code snippet is simply printing the string `'8'`. The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it does not reference any variables or objects defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output will always be `8` regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `g`, or `d`.
