Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `k` is not equal to 99999999999, 1999999999, 10000000000000, 9999999999, 101, 100000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or 2147483648. Additionally, either `n` is not 1, or `k` is not 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not 1. Furthermore, either `k` is not equal to 2147483648 or `n` is not equal to 2. Also, either `n` is not 2 or `k` is not 1000000000 or `a` is not `[1000000000, 1000000000]`. Moreover, `n` is not 5 or `k` is not 2147483648, and `n` is not 20 or `k` is not 10000000000. Additionally, either `n` is not 2, or `k` is not `a[0] - 1`, or `k` is not `a[1] - 2`. Finally, the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a`.**
