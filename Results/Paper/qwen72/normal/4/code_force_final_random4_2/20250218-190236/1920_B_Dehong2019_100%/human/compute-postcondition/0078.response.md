Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 0. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k+x-2])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k+x-2])`. Otherwise, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k+x-2])` plus `a[0]`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k+x-2])`.***
