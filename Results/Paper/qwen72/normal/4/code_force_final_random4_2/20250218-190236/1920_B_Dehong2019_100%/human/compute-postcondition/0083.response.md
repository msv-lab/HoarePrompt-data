Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 1, `ans1` is initially increased by `a[1]`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and the previous `ans2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains increased by `a[1]` and `ans2` is the maximum of this `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.***
