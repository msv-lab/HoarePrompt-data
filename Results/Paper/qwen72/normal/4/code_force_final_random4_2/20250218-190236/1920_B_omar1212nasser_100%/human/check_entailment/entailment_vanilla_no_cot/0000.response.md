Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice's Removals**:
   - Alice's strategy should be to remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. The current implementation does not correctly handle this. It subtracts elements from the end of the sorted list, which are the largest elements, not the smallest.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Bob's Negations**:
   - Bob's strategy should be to negate the smallest elements to minimize the sum. The current implementation does not correctly handle this. It negates the largest elements, which does not minimize the sum effectively.

3. **Logic for Combined Operations**:
   - The logic for combining Alice's removals and Bob's negations is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the interaction between the two operations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Sort the array to facilitate the removal of the smallest elements.
- Use a greedy approach to remove the smallest elements first (Alice's strategy).
- Use a greedy approach to negate the smallest elements first (Bob's strategy).
- Consider the combined effect of both operations to find the optimal sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Remove the smallest k elements
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Calculate the initial sum after removals
    s = sum(elements)
    
    # Calculate the sum after negating the smallest x elements
    elements.sort()
    for i in range(negatives):
        if elements[i] > 0:
            break
        elements[i] = -elements[i]
    
    # Return the final sum
    return sum(elements)

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Function 1**:
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \).
  - Reads the array elements.
  - Sorts the array.
  - Calls `func_2` to compute the optimal sum and prints it.

- **Function 2**:
  - Removes the smallest \( k \) elements from the array.
  - Sorts the remaining elements.
  - Negates the smallest \( x \) elements to minimize the sum.
  - Returns the final sum of the array.

This approach ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally according to their respective goals.
