The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements)`, and `elements` is a list of integers where `1 <= elements[i] <= 1000`. The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains the initial element and the values of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which is generated based on the values of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration, where `s` and `s2` are derived from the input parameters and the list `elements`.**
