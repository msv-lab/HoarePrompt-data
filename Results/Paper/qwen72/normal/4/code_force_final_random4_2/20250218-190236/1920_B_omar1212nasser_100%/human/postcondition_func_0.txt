The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program includes `t` being the number of test cases processed, `i` being `t-1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` being the values from the last test case, `a` being the sorted list from the last test case, and the printed results from `func_2` for each test case.
