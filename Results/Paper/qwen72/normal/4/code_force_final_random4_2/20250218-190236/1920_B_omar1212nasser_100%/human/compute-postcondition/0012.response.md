Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the element at the index `-i` from the list `elements`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `removals` remains greater than 0. The other variables are not affected.
