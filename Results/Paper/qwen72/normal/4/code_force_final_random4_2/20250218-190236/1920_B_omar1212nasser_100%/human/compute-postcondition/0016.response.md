Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`, if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is also updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`, `pos` is updated to include the value `s - 2 * s2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s - 2 * s2` is appended to the list `pos`.
- The values of `removals`, `i`, `s`, and `s2` remain as described in the initial state.
- If the condition `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements` is true, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`.
- The states of other variables are not affected.
