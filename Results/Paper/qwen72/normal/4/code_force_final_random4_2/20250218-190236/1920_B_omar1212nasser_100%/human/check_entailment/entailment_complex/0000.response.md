### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` takes three parameters: `removals` (k), `negatives` (x), and `elements` (a).
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in `elements`.
   - It initializes `s2` as the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), adjusting `s` and `s2` by removing the largest elements and potentially adding back the smallest elements if `negatives + i` is within the bounds of the list.
   - It calculates the potential sum after each removal and appends it to the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob will multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The function `func_2` correctly simulates this by considering the sum of the array after removing the smallest elements and then adjusting the sum by multiplying the smallest remaining elements by -1.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `removals` or `negatives` are 0.
   - It also handles the case where the number of removals is equal to the number of elements, resulting in an empty list.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case: `n = 1, k = 1, x = 1, a = [1]`. Alice removes the only element, and the sum is 0.
   - For the second test case: `n = 4, k = 1, x = 1, a = [3, 1, 2, 4]`. Alice does not remove any elements, Bob multiplies 4 by -1, and the sum is 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.
   - For the fifth test case: `n = 8, k = 5, x = 3, a = [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 9, 9]`. Alice removes the largest elements [9, 9, 5, 5, 3], and Bob multiplies the remaining [3, 3, 2] by -1, resulting in -3 - 3 - 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 = -5.

### Correctness: **True**

The program correctly simulates the game where Alice and Bob play optimally, and it produces the correct output for the given examples and constraints.
