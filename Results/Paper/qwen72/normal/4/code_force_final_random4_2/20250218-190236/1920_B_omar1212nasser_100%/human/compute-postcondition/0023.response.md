Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `removals` will be equal to the number of iterations the loop has run, `s` will be the initial sum of `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, `s2` will be the initial sum of the last `negatives` elements minus the sum of the last `removals` elements plus the sum of the elements from the `negatives + removals` position to the `negatives` position, and `pos` will be a list containing the initial element and the values of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- `removals` will be the total number of iterations the loop has run.
- `s` will be the sum of all elements in `elements` except for the last `removals` elements.
- `s2` will be the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, plus the sum of the elements from the `negatives + removals` position to the `negatives` position.
- `pos` will be a list that starts with the initial value of `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and then includes the value of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of the loop.
