Postcondition: **`index` is `7 + 2*q + n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + n])`, `r` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + n + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is 0.**
