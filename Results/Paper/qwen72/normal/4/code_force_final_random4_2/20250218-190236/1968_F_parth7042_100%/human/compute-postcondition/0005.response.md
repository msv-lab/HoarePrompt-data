The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be explicitly set.

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
