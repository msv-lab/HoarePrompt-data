Output State: **`index` is `5 + 2*q`, `a` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the integer value of the corresponding element in `data` starting from index 3, `pf` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from index 1 to the current index, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `_` is `q`, `q` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*q + 1]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*q]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2*q]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the value `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions evaluated in each iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*q]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 2, so it changes from `3 + 2*q` to `5 + 2*q`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
