Output State: **`index` is `5 + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `_` is `q`, `q` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*q + 1]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*q]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2*q]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the value `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions evaluated in each iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*q]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pf = [0] * (n + 1)` reinitializes the `pf` list to a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
- All other variables (`index`, `a`, `mp`, `_`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `results`, `n`) remain unchanged.
- The new `pf` list is now a list of zeros, which means any operations that depend on the values in `pf` will now use these zeros.
