Output State: **`index` is `7 + 2*q + n + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is now a `defaultdict` with lists as default values, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.**
