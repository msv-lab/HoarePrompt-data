Output State: **`v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `_` is 2, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])` and must be greater than 2, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 4`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[r]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`. The value of `r` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
