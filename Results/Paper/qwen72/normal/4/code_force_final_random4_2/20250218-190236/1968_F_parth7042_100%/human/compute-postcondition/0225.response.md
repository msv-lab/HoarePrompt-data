Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `index` is defined as `7 + 2*t*q`.
   - `results` is a list of strings containing either 'YES' or 'NO' with a length of `t*q`.

2. **Understanding the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is using the `'\n'.join(results)` method, which joins all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - Since `results` is a list of strings with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', the `print` statement will output each element of the `results` list on a new line.
   - The length of the `results` list is `t*q`, so there will be `t*q` lines of output, each line being either 'YES' or 'NO'.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line, with the total number of lines being `t*q`.

Output: **[t*q lines of 'YES' or 'NO' (where each line is either 'YES' or 'NO' and t*q is the length of the results list)]**
