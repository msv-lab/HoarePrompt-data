The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was a specific value, and `pf[i]` was updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `i` was appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i`.

State: **`pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`**
