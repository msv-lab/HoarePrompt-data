The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i` for the loop to execute again.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a[i]` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`
- `pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`
- `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`
- `index` is `index + 1`
- `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the value `i` appended to its previous list

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`

State: **`a[i]` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, `pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `index` is `index + 1`, `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the value `i` appended to its previous list**
