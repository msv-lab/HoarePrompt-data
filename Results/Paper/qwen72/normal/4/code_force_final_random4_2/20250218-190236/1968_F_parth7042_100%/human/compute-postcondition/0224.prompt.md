Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    q = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = defaultdict(list)
    mp[0].append(0)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp[pf[r]]
        v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
        it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is `3 + 2*q`, `a` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the integer value of the corresponding element in `data` starting from index 3, `pf` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from index 1 to the current index, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `_` is `q - 1`, `q` is the number of iterations the loop was set to execute, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*(q-1)]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2*(q-1)]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the value `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions evaluated in each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `index` is `5 + 2*q + n + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is q, index is 7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + n + 2*q, results is a list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' with length q.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
