You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where '1' indicates the presence of a cat and '0' indicates the absence of a cat.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The loop has finished executing, so `i` is equal to `n`. The `counter` variable contains the total number of times a character in `s1` was different from the corresponding character in `s2`, considering the special case where consecutive different characters in `s1` and `s2` are also different from each other in `s1`.
    return counter
    #The program returns the total number of times a character in `s1` was different from the corresponding character in `s2`, considering the special case where consecutive different characters in `s1` and `s2` are also different from each other in `s1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. It returns the total number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, including an additional count for consecutive differing characters in `s1` and `s2` that are also different from each other in `s1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of times a character in `s1` was different from the corresponding character in `s2`, considering the special case where consecutive different characters in `s1` and `s2` are also different from each other in `s1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
