You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where '1' indicates the presence of a cat and '0' indicates the absence of a cat.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The loop has finished executing, so `i` is equal to `n`. The `counter` variable contains the total number of times a character in `s1` was different from the corresponding character in `s2`, considering the special case where consecutive different characters in `s1` and `s2` are also different from each other in `s1`.
    return counter
    #The program returns the total number of times a character in `s1` was different from the corresponding character in `s2`, considering the special case where consecutive different characters in `s1` and `s2` are also different from each other in `s1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `s1`, and `s2` (two strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters). It returns the total number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ. If two consecutive positions in `s1` and `s2` differ and the characters in `s1` at these positions are also different, the function counts this as a single difference. The final state of the program is that `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged, and the function has returned the computed count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` boxes, each of which can either contain a cat (`1`) or be empty (`0`).
   - We are given the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) and the desired state of the boxes (`s2`).
   - We can perform three types of operations: add a cat, remove a cat, or move a cat from one box to another.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

2. **Analyzing the Operations:**
   - **Add a cat:** This operation is needed when a box in the desired state has a cat but the initial state does not.
   - **Remove a cat:** This operation is needed when a box in the initial state has a cat but the desired state does not.
   - **Move a cat:** This operation is needed when a cat needs to be moved from one box to another to match the desired state.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the boxes from left to right.
   - For each box, it checks if the current state (`s1[i]`) matches the desired state (`s2[i]`).
   - If the states do not match:
     - It checks if the next box (`s1[i + 1]`) also does not match the desired state and if the current and next boxes have different states.
     - If both conditions are met, it performs a "move" operation by incrementing the counter by 1 and skipping the next box (`i += 2`).
     - If the conditions are not met, it performs an "add" or "remove" operation by incrementing the counter by 1 and moving to the next box (`i += 1`).
   - If the states match, it simply moves to the next box (`i += 1`).

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies when a cat needs to be added or removed.
   - The algorithm also correctly identifies when a cat can be moved from one box to another, which is more efficient than adding and removing separately.
   - The algorithm ensures that the minimum number of operations is used by always trying to move a cat when possible before adding or removing.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles cases where the initial and desired states are identical (e.g., the second test case).
   - The algorithm handles cases where the initial state has no cats and the desired state has all cats (e.g., the third test case).
   - The algorithm handles cases where the initial state has all cats and the desired state has no cats (e.g., the first test case).

6. **Complexity:**
   - The algorithm runs in O(n) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem by determining the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
