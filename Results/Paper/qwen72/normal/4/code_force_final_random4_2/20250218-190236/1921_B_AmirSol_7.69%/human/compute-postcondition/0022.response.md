To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop condition, which in this case is `i` and `n`.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
- If `s1[i]` != `s2[i]`, `counter` is increased by 1.
- If `i` < `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` != `s2[i + 1]` and (`s1[i]` != `s1[i + 1]`), then `i` is increased by 2.
- Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.
- If `s1[i]` == `s2[i]`, `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than or equal to `n`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1 or 2, depending on the conditions described.
- The loop will execute one more time if `i` is still less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- Since `i` is increased by 1 or 2 in the loop body, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `i` must be such that `i < n` for the loop to execute one more time.
- The state of `n` remains unchanged because it is a fixed positive integer.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `i` is less than `n`**
