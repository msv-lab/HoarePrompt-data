Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `i` is now `i + 1` and is less than or equal to `n`.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and it is now `i + 1`. Since `i` was initially less than `n`, after incrementing, `i` is still less than or equal to `n`. The other variables `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
