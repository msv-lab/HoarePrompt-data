Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is equal to `left + 1`, `big_element` is equal to `right + 1`, `mid` is equal to `(right - left) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mid` as the integer division of the difference between `big_element` and `small_element` plus 1, by 2. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the expression simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which further simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
