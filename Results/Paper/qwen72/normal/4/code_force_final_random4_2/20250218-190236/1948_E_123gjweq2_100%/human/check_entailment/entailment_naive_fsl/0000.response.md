Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. According to the problem description, `k` can be up to `2n`, but the program's logic for creating cliques and assigning elements to the array `arr` and `cliquess` assumes that `k` is less than `n`. This assumption can lead to incorrect results when `k` is large.

For example, consider the input `n = 5` and `k = 10`. The program will calculate `cliques = ceil(5 / 10) = 1`, and then call `make_array(0, 4, 1)`. However, the `make_array` function will attempt to assign elements to `arr` and `cliquess` in a way that does not ensure the correct partitioning of the graph into cliques, as it does not account for the large value of `k`.

To fix this, the program should handle the case where `k` is large and ensure that the graph is correctly partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
