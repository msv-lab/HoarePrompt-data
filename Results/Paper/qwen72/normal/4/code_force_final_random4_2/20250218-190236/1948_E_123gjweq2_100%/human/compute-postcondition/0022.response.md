Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `not_mid` must be greater than 2, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` is assigned the value `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is now assigned the value `big_element - 2`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`. Since `i` is 2, `cliquess[left + mid + 2]` is now assigned the value `clique`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
