Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `small_element`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - 3]` is `small_element + 2`, `arr[left]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + 2]` is `clique`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cliquess[left + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + 2]` to be `clique`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
