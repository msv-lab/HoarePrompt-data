### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices of a graph and then partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` assigns values to the vertices and determines the clique assignments.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Clique Calculation:**
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because it ensures that each vertex is assigned to a clique, and the number of cliques is minimized.
   - **Array Initialization:**
     - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to lists of zeros, each of length `n`.
   - **Calling `make_array`:**
     - The function `make_array` is called for each clique, passing the starting index, ending index, and the clique number. This ensures that the vertices are assigned values and clique assignments are made in a systematic manner.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - **Assigning Values:**
     - The function assigns values to the vertices in the range `[left, right]`.
     - It calculates the middle point `mid` and the number of elements not in the middle `not_mid`.
     - For the first half of the range, it assigns increasing values from `small_element` to `arr` and sets the corresponding `cliquess` values to the current clique number.
     - For the second half of the range, it assigns decreasing values from `big_element` to `arr` and sets the corresponding `cliquess` values to the current clique number.
   - **Correctness of Assignments:**
     - The values assigned to `arr` are distinct and within the range [1, n].
     - The `cliquess` array is correctly filled to ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

5. **Edge Condition:**
   - The program does not explicitly check the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \). However, the way vertices are assigned and partitioned into cliques ensures that this condition is met.
   - By assigning values in a way that minimizes the differences between adjacent vertices within each clique, the edge condition is implicitly satisfied. This is because the values are assigned in a pattern that ensures the differences are small enough to meet the condition.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before `func_1` Call:**
  - `n` and `k` are integers such that \( 2 \le n \le 40 \) and \( 1 \le k \le 2n \).

- **State Before `make_array` Call:**
  - `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left <= right`, and `clique` is a positive integer.
  - The `make_array` function is called with the correct arguments to ensure that the vertices are assigned values and clique assignments are made.

- **State After `make_array` Call:**
  - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are correctly updated with the assigned values and clique assignments.
  - The values in `arr` are distinct and within the range [1, n].
  - The values in `cliquess` ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly solves the problem by assigning distinct integers to vertices and partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques. The logic for assigning values and ensuring the edge condition is met is sound.

Final: **True**
