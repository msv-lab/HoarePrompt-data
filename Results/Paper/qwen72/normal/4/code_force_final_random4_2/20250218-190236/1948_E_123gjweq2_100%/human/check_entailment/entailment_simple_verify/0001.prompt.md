You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to the vertices of a graph.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` is the main function that calculates the number of cliques and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is a helper function that assigns values to the vertices and determines the clique assignments.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the starting index, ending index, and the clique number.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - It assigns values to the vertices in the range `[left, right]`.
   - It calculates the middle point `mid` and the number of elements not in the middle `not_mid`.
   - It fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays accordingly:
     - For the first half of the range, it assigns increasing values from `small_element` to `arr` and sets the corresponding `cliquess` values to the current clique number.
     - For the second half of the range, it assigns decreasing values from `big_element` to `arr` and sets the corresponding `cliquess` values to the current clique number.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Clique Calculation:**
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct because it ensures that each vertex is assigned to a clique, and the number of cliques is minimized.
   - **Vertex Assignment:**
     - The `make_array` function ensures that the values assigned to the vertices are distinct and within the range [1, n].
   - **Clique Assignment:**
     - The `cliquess` array is correctly filled to ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
   - **Edge Condition:**
     - The program does not explicitly check the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \), but the way vertices are assigned and partitioned into cliques ensures that this condition is met. This is because the values are assigned in a way that minimizes the differences between adjacent vertices within each clique.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by assigning values to vertices and partitioning them into the minimum number of cliques. The logic for assigning values and ensuring the edge condition is met is sound.

Correctness: **True**
