The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `mid` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `mid` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is assigned the value `small_element`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is assigned the value `small_element + 1`, `arr[left]` is assigned the value `clique`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is assigned the value `clique`**
