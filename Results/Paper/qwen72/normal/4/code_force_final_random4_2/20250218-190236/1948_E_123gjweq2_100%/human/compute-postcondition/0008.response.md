Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is assigned the value `small_element`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is assigned the value `small_element + 1`, `arr[left]` is assigned the value `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i` updates the value at the index `left + mid - 2` in the array `arr` to `small_element + 1`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, so `i - 1` is 0.
- Therefore, `left + mid - i - 1` simplifies to `left + mid - 2`.
- The value at this index is updated to `small_element + 1`.
- The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
