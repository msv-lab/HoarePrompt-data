Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `not_mid - 1`, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + not_mid - 1]` are assigned the values `big_element` to `big_element - not_mid + 1` respectively, `cliquess[left + mid]` to `cliquess[left + mid + not_mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `left` and `right` remain unchanged: `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` less than or equal to `right` and the difference `right - left` is at least 1.
- The variable `mid` remains greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- The loop index `i` will be `not_mid - 1` after all iterations, indicating that the loop has run `not_mid` times.
- The array `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` still contains the values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- The array `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` still contains the value `clique`.
- The array `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be filled with values starting from `big_element` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent index, ending at `big_element - not_mid + 1`.
- The array `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be filled with the value `clique` for each index in this range.
