The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The precondition states that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer that is even. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t` or `n` in any way. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
