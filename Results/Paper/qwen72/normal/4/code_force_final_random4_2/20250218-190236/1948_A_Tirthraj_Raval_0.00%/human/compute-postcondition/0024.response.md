Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `pattern` is an empty list, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pattern = []` reassigns `pattern` to an empty list, overriding any previous value it had. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
