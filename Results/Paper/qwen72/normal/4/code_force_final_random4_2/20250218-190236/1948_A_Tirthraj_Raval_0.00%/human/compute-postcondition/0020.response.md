The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.**
