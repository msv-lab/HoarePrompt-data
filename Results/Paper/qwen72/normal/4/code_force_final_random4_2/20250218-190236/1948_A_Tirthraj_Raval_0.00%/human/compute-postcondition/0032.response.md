Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 7, `i` is 3, `pattern` is a list that now contains the characters `'A'`, `'B'`, `'A'`, `'B'`, and `'B'`**. 

The code appends the character `'B'` to the list `pattern` because `i % 2` is 1, and `'AB'[1]` is `'B'`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
