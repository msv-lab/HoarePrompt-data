To determine what will be printed by the `print(''.join(pattern))` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the construction of the `pattern` list step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `pattern` is a list of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'B' if `n` is even, and starting with 'A' if `n` is odd, with the total length of the list being `n`.

2. **Pattern Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the pattern starts with 'B' and alternates 'A' and 'B'.
   - If `n` is odd, the pattern starts with 'A' and alternates 'A' and 'B'.
   - The total length of the pattern list is `n`.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - For `n = 2` (even):
     - Pattern: `['B', 'A']`
     - Output: **BA**
   - For `n = 3` (odd):
     - Pattern: `['A', 'B', 'A']`
     - Output: **ABA**
   - For `n = 4` (even):
     - Pattern: `['B', 'A', 'B', 'A']`
     - Output: **BABA**
   - For `n = 5` (odd):
     - Pattern: `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']`
     - Output: **ABABA**

4. **General Case**:
   - If `n` is even, the pattern will start with 'B' and alternate 'A' and 'B' until the list has `n` elements.
   - If `n` is odd, the pattern will start with 'A' and alternate 'A' and 'B' until the list has `n` elements.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(''.join(pattern))` statement will join all the elements of the `pattern` list into a single string and print it.
   - The output will be a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'B' if `n` is even and starting with 'A' if `n` is odd, with the total length of the string being `n`.

Output: **a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'B' if `n` is even and starting with 'A' if `n` is odd, with the total length of the string being `n`**
