The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts mentions that the function should accept a single integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, but this is not directly related to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
