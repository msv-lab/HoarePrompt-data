The value of `n` is reassigned to the new input integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`, if the new `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If the new `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.
