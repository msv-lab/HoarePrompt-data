Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `pattern` is `['B', 'A']` if `n` is even, `pattern` is `['A', 'B', 'A']` if `n` is odd**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be at least 4.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The code appends `'AB'[i % 2]` to the `pattern` list. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2` is 1, so `'AB'[1]` is `'B'`.
- If `n` is even, `pattern` was initially `['B']`, and after appending `'A'`, it becomes `['B', 'A']`.
- If `n` is odd, `pattern` was initially `['A', 'B']`, and after appending `'A'`, it becomes `['A', 'B', 'A']`.
