The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `num`. The loop will execute one more time if there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the first element of `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` will be the second element of `arr`, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key. If `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` > `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` remains 1.**
