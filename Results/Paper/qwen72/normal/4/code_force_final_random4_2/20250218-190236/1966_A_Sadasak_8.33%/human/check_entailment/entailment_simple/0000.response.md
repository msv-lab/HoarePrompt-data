### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, the program correctly prints `k - 1` because all cards can be exchanged in one operation, leaving `k - 1` cards.
   - These edge cases are handled correctly.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`.
   - It ensures that the frequency of any card number does not exceed `k` by setting `frequency_table[num]` to `k` if it exceeds `k`.
   - This is a valid approach because if a card number appears more than `k` times, we can only use up to `k` of them in one operation.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - After calculating the frequency, the program checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`.
   - If such a card number exists, it prints `k - 1` because we can perform one operation to exchange `k` cards and be left with `k - 1` cards.
   - If no card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the first test case (5 3, 4 1 1 4 4), the program should output 2. The frequency table will be `{4: 3, 1: 2}`, and since 3 is in the values, the program outputs `k - 1 = 2`.
   - For the second test case (1 10, 7), the program should output 1. Since `k` is greater than `n`, the program outputs `n = 1`.
   - For the third test case (7 2, 4 2 1 100 5 2 3), the program should output 1. The frequency table will be `{4: 1, 2: 2, 1: 1, 100: 1, 5: 1, 3: 1}`, and since 2 is in the values, the program outputs `k - 1 = 1`.
   - For the fourth test case (10 4, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1), the program should output 3. The frequency table will be `{1: 4}`, and since 4 is in the values, the program outputs `k - 1 = 3`.
   - For the fifth test case (5 2, 3 8 1 48 7), the program should output 5. The frequency table will be `{3: 1, 8: 1, 1: 1, 48: 1, 7: 1}`, and since no value is equal to `k`, the program outputs `n = 5`.
   - For the sixth test case (6 2, 10 20 30 10 20 40), the program should output 1. The frequency table will be `{10: 2, 20: 2, 30: 1, 40: 1}`, and since 2 is in the values, the program outputs `k - 1 = 1`.
   - For the seventh test case (6 3, 10 20 30 10 20 40), the program should output 6. The frequency table will be `{10: 2, 20: 2, 30: 1, 40: 1}`, and since no value is equal to `k`, the program outputs `n = 6`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
