Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` > `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains 1.***
