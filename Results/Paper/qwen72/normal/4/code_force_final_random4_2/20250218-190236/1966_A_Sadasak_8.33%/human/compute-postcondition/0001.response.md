The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, which ensures that `arr` has at least one element. Therefore, the loop will execute with `num` being the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
