The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100. `k` is an integer between 2 and 100. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and the value for each key is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`.**
