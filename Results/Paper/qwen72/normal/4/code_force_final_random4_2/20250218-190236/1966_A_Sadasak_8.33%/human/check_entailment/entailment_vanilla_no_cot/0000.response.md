Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it is. However, this does not account for the correct minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

2. The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of cards with the same number is a multiple of `k`. In such cases, you can perform the operation multiple times, reducing the number of cards to a minimum.

3. The program does not consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards to less than `k` by performing the operations optimally.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:

- Count the frequency of each card number.
- For each card number, determine how many cards can be removed by performing the operation as many times as possible.
- Sum the remaining cards to get the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
        continue
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards_left = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards_left += count % k
    
    print(max(1, min_cards_left))
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the frequency of each card number and performing the operations optimally.
