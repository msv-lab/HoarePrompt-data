Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` has at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 1. If `a` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `2 * a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.**
