Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is `2^len(L)`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `_` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
