Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` has at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
