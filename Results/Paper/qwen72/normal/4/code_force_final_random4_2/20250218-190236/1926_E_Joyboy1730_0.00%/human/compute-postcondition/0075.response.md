Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - (3 * a)`, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is `3 * a`, `pow` is 8, `m` is 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables retain their values as described in the precondition.**
