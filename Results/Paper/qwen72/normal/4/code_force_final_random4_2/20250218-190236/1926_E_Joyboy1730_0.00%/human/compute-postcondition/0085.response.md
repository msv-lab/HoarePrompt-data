Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero and greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `_` is 1**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`, `m`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
