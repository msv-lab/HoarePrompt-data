Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer input, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is `sum(L)`, `pow` is `2^len(L)`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is the first integer input and must be non-zero. The other variables remain unchanged. `t` is still greater than 0, `k` is still the second integer input, `L` is still an empty list, `tot` is still `sum(L)`, and `pow` is still `2^len(L)`.
