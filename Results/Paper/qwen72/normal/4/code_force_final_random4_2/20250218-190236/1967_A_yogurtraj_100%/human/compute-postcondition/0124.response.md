Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`, `k` is not 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- The values of `ii`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `k`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The previous conditions for `n`, `a`, `rem`, `k`, and `y` are still valid.
- The specific value of `r` is now `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
