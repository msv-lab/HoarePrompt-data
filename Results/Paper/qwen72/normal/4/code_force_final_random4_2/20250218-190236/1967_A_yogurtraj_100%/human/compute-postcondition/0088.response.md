Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `rem` is 0 or the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` at the point where the loop breaks, `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` at the point where the loop breaks. If `k` is non-zero, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` at the point where the loop breaks, and `k` is 0.**
