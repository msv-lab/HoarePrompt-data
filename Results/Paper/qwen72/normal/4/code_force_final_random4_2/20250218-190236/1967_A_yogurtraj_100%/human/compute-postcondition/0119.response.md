The code snippet `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` updates the value of `k` by subtracting the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Given the initial state, let's break down the impact:

- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers, so `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` are specific elements from this list.
- The expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` evaluates to `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- `k` is updated by subtracting `3 * (a[3] - a[2])` from its current value.

Since the value of `k` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the change to `k` in terms of the expression.

Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is reduced by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.**
