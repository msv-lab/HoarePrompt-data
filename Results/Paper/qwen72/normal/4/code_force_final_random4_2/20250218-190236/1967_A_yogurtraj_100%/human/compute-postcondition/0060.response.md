Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is 0. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k), then `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`, and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > 0) is true. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) ≤ k), then `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the second element of `a`, and `y` remains 0.***
