The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and the result of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, the number of test cases `t` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `ii` should be 0, and `t` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

State: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
