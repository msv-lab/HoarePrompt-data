The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value, which means `n - 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
