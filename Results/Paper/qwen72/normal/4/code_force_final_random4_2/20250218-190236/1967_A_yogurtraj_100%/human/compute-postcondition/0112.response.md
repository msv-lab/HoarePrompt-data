Postcondition: ***`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, `r` is `a[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `y` is 0, and `r` is updated to `a[2]`.***
