Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
