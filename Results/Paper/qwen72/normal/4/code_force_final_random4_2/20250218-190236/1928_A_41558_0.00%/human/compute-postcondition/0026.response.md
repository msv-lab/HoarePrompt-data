Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to the initial value of `n`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, as it is not modified by the loop.
- The variables `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input for each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, `a` and `b` will hold the values from the last iteration.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is only used to determine the number of iterations.
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
