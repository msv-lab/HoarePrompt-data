The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
