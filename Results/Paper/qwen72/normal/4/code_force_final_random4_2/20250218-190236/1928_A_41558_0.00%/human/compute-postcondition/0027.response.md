The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and there are `t` test cases where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function should return a result for each test case.

Since the output is not specified, I will infer the most common scenario where the function returns a result based on the relationship between `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function operates on `t` test cases, where each test case includes two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the relationship between `a` and `b`.**
