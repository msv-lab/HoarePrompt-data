Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` correctly identifies if both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd. If both are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and thus, Bob cannot form another rectangle. The function prints 'NO' in this case, which is correct.

3. **Exact Half Check**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other. This condition is intended to identify cases where the rectangle can only be cut into two identical smaller rectangles, and no new rectangle can be formed. However, this condition is incorrect. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original. The correct condition should be `elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a` to check if one dimension is exactly twice the other.

4. **Default Case**: The `else` block correctly handles all other cases where Bob can form another rectangle. This includes cases where at least one dimension is even and not exactly twice the other.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is not the correct way to check if one dimension is exactly twice the other.

Correctness: **False**
