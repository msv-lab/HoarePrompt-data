Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, they remain odd.
- Otherwise, either `a` is even, `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are even.
- If `a` is exactly half of `b` or `b` is exactly half of `a`, this condition is satisfied.
- Otherwise, `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
- `a` and `b` are assigned new values from the input, which are integers.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides a set of conditions and constraints on the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`, but none of these conditions or constraints affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string, regardless of the values of the variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
