Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd, they remain odd, and `i` is incremented by 1, with `n` being greater than the new value of `i`. If either `a` or `b` is even, or both are even, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If `a` is exactly half of `b` or `b` is exactly half of `a`, `a` and `b` are assigned new values from the input, which are integers. If `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`, `a` and `b` are also assigned new values from the input, which are integers.**
