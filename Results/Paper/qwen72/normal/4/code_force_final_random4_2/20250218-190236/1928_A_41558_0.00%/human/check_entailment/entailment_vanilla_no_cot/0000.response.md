Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles to form a different rectangle. The conditions `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` and `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` are not sufficient to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle.

1. **First Condition (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`)**:
   - This condition correctly identifies that if both dimensions are odd, then Bob cannot form a different rectangle because cutting an odd-length side will always result in non-integer dimensions.

2. **Second Condition (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`)**:
   - This condition is incorrect. It checks if half of one dimension equals the other dimension. However, this is not the only case where Bob cannot form a different rectangle. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is considered the same as 2x4. The correct condition should be to check if the rectangle can be cut into two identical rectangles, which means checking if `a == b` or if one dimension is exactly twice the other.

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - Bob can form a different rectangle if and only if the rectangle can be cut into two non-identical rectangles. This means that at least one of the dimensions must be even, and the resulting rectangles should not be identical to the original rectangle.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This program correctly checks if at least one of the dimensions is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for Bob to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it correctly outputs "NO".
