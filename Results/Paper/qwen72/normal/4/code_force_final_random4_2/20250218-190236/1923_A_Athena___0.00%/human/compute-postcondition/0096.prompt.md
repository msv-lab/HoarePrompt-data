You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, the input includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. The input is provided in a structured format where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by t test cases, each consisting of two lines as described. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1` (which is the last iteration index), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the last input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed, `i` is the length of the last `a` minus 1, and `res` is the number of zeros in the last `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. The function returns the result for each test case, indicating the state or configuration of the ribbon based on the input. If the input is invalid (e.g., negative `n` or a list with fewer or more than `n` elements), the function should handle it appropriately.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
