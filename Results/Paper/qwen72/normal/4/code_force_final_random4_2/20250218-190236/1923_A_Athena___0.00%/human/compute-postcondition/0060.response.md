Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is 0, `res` is 3 if the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i-1]`) is 0, and `res` is 2 if the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i-1]`) is not 0. If `a[i]` is not 0, `res` remains 1 if the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i-1]`) is not 0, and `res` remains 2 if the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i-1]`) is 0.***
