Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. The function returns the result for each test case, indicating the state or configuration of the ribbon based on the input. If the input is invalid (e.g., negative `n` or a list with fewer or more than `n` elements), the function should handle it appropriately.**
