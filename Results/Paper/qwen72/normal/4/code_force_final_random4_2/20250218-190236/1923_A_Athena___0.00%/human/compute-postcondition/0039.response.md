Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with the first two elements removed and the new first element is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with the first element removed and the new first element is 0.
- After executing `a.pop(0)`, the first element of `a` (which is 0) is removed, so now `a` has the first two elements removed from the original list, and the new first element is the third element of the original list.
- The length of `a` is reduced by 1, so `i` is now `len(a) - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
