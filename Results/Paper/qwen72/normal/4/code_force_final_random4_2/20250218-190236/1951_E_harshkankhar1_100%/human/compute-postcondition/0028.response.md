Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True, which means the entire string `s` satisfies the condition defined by `func_1`.
   - `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `2`.
   - The initial state provides information about the string `s`, its length `n`, the function `func_1`, and the variable `x`, but none of these affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `func_1`, or `x`.

Output: **2**
