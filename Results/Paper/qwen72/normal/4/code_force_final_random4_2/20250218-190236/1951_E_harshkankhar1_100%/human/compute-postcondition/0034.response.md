Let's analyze the precondition step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
   - `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True.
   - `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Understanding the Precondition**:
   - `func_1(s[0:])` being True implies that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` being True implies that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end of the string.
   - `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
   - This statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the results of `func_1`.

Since the `print` statement is a simple string literal and does not depend on any variables or conditions, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
