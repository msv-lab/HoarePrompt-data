Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
   - `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end of the string.
   - `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `s`, `n`, `x`, and the results of `func_1` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is hardcoded to print `'NO'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the results of `func_1`, the `print` statement will always output `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
