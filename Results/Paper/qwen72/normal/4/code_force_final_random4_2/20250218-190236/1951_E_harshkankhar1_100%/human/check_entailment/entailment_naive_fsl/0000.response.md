Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is a palindrome and has a length of 2. For example, if the input string is "aa", the program will print "NO" because it cannot find a non-palindromic substring. However, the correct output should be "YES" with the string partitioned into two parts, each of length 1, since a single character is not considered a palindrome in the context of this problem. The program should be able to handle such cases by checking if the string length is 2 and all characters are the same, and then output "YES" with the string partitioned into two parts.
