Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, and `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, then the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1`. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, and if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value. If `x` is not 1 and not `n // 2`, then `x` is not equal to 1 and not equal to `n // 2`.**
