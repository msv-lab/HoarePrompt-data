You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

If `x` is not 1 and not `n // 2`, then `x` is not equal to 1 and not equal to `n // 2`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - The function returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single part.
     - This is correct because if the string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into a single part which is not a palindrome.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it then tries to find the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
     - It iterates through the string and sets `x` to the index of the first different character.
     - If no such character is found (`x` remains -1), it prints "NO".
     - This is correct because if all characters are the same, the string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.
   - If a different character is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two parts: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because if `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, the partition is valid.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`.
     - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
     - This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible partitions. For example, if `s` is "abba" and `x` is 1, the function will print "NO" even though "ab" and "ba" are valid non-palindromic partitions.
   - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two parts: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
     - This is correct because if `x` is not 1 or `n // 2`, the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` will ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but it has a logical error in the condition where it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. This condition is too restrictive and can lead to incorrect "NO" outputs for some valid cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, we should remove the condition that checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` and instead always try to partition the string into two parts when a different character is found. Here is the corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    if not func_1(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    else:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(2)
    print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

This version will correctly handle all cases by ensuring that the string is partitioned into two non-palindromic parts whenever possible.
