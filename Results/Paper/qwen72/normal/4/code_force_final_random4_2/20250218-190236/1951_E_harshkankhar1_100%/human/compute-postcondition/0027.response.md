Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True. This means that the entire string `s` satisfies the condition defined by `func_1`.
   - `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state provides conditions about the string `s` and the function `func_1`, but these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of these conditions and will always print 'YES' when executed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1`.

Output: **YES**
