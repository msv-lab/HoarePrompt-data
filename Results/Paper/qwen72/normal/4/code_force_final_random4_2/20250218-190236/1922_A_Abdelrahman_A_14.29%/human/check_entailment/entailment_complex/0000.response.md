Reasoning:

The function `func` is intended to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. However, the logic in the function is flawed and does not correctly implement the required conditions.

1. **Initial Check for Equality**:
   - The function first checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO' and sets `no` to `False`. This is correct because if `c` is exactly the same as `a` or `b`, there cannot be a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

2. **Character Check**:
   - The function then iterates over each character in `c` and checks if the character is not present in `a` or `b`. If it finds such a character, it prints 'YES' and sets `no` to `False`, breaking out of the loop.
   - This logic is incorrect because it only checks if a character in `c` is not present in `a` or `b`, but it does not check if `a` and `b` can form a valid template that `c` does not match. For example, if `a = "abc"`, `b = "def"`, and `c = "ghi"`, the function will incorrectly print 'YES' because all characters in `c` are not in `a` or `b`, but there is no valid template that `a` and `b` can match while `c` does not.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it but `c` does not, the function should:
     - For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and not equal to `c[i]`.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, ensure that `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
     - If all positions satisfy these conditions, print 'YES'. Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Given the incorrect logic in the character check, the function does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
