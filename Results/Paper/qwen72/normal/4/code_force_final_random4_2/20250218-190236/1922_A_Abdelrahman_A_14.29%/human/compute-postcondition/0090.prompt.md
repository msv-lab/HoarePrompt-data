Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) represents the number of test cases. `tests` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. If `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b` and contains at least one character, `no` is False if any character in `c` is not found in `a` or `b`; otherwise, `no` remains True. If `no` is True, the current value of `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, if any character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b`, `no` is False. If all characters in `c` are in `a` or `b`, `no` remains True. If `no` is True, the current value of `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, and all characters in `c` are found in `a` or `b`, then `no` is True. Otherwise, `no` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
