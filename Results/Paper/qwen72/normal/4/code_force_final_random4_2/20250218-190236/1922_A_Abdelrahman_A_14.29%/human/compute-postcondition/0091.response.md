The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) represents the number of test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters.**
