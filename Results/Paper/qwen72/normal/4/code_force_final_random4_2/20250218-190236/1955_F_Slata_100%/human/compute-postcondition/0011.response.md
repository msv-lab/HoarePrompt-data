Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, the function calculates and prints a value which is the sum of half the counts of each integer (rounded down) plus 1 if exactly three of the counts are odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases, and the final state includes the printed results for all test cases. **
