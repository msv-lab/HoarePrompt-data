Let's break down the `print` statement step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the input integers, each greater than 0.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a // 2`: This is the integer division of `a` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `b // 2`: This is the integer division of `b` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `c // 2`: This is the integer division of `c` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `d // 2`: This is the integer division of `d` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `a % 2`: This is the remainder when `a` is divided by 2.
   - `b % 2`: This is the remainder when `b` is divided by 2.
   - `c % 2`: This is the remainder when `c` is divided by 2.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2`: This is the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`: This checks if the sum of the remainders is equal to 3. If true, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This converts the boolean result to an integer (1 if true, 0 if false).

3. **Final Expression:**
   - The `print` statement will print the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 is 3, otherwise plus 0.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The integer division `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` will each give a quotient.
   - The sum of these quotients will be added to the result of the condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`.
   - If `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` equals 3, it means that all three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd numbers, and the condition will add 1 to the sum of the quotients.
   - If `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` does not equal 3, the condition will add 0 to the sum of the quotients.

5. **Output:**
   - The output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all odd, otherwise plus 0.

Output: **(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + 1 if a, b, and c are all odd, otherwise a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2)**
