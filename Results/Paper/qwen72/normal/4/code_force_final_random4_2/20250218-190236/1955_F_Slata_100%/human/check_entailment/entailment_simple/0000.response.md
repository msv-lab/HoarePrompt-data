### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) and the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence is even for each number.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.
   - The program then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula:
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` count the number of pairs of each number. Each pair of the same number will XOR to zero, so these pairs do not affect the XOR result.
     - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders when `a`, `b`, and `c` are divided by 2 is equal to 3. This is a condition where there are three odd counts among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and one even count (since `d` is always even in this context). If this condition is true, it means that removing one of the odd-count numbers will make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win one additional time.

3. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` correctly counts the number of pairs that can be removed without affecting the XOR result.
   - The condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` is used to handle the case where there are three odd counts and one even count. This is correct because:
     - If there are three odd counts and one even count, removing one of the odd-count numbers will make the XOR zero.
     - If there are fewer than three odd counts, removing any number will not make the XOR zero.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the input constraints correctly (1 <= t <= 10^4 and 0 <= p_i <= 200).
   - The program correctly processes each test case and prints the result.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
