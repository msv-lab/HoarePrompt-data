Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **XOR Calculation**: The winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s (since 4 is 0 in XOR) is even.
3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**: To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in a way that keeps the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as much as possible. This is achieved by:
   - Removing pairs of the same numbers (1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s) to keep the XOR zero.
   - If there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, removing one of these numbers will make the XOR non-zero, allowing Alice to win. Therefore, Eve should aim to keep the number of such odd counts to a minimum.

4. **Calculation**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be removed, which keeps the XOR zero.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there are exactly three odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s. If so, removing one of these will make the XOR non-zero, allowing Alice to win. This condition ensures that Bob wins one more time if there are exactly three odd counts.

The logic and implementation are correct, and the program will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
