The variables in the loop head are `r` and `l`. The loop condition is `r - l > 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the difference between `r` and `l` must still be greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
- `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
- `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mid` is (l + r) // 2.
- `r - l` must be greater than 1.
- If `array[mid]` <= `find`, `l` is updated to `mid`.
- Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.

Given that `r - l` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, and the only variables we can adjust are `r` and `l`, we need to ensure that the difference between `r` and `l` remains greater than 1. Since `l` and `r` are updated based on the value of `mid`, and `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, the difference `r - l` will be halved each iteration. Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted to ensure `r - l` is still greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `r - l` must be greater than 1**.
