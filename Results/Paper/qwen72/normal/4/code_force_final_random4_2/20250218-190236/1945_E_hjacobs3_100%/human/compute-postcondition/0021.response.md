The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
- The initial state provides a detailed description of the `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r`, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
