Output State: **The program returns a list containing two string values: the first value is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, or 0 if `find` is less than `array[0]`. The second value is the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.**
