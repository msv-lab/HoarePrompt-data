Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is 3. According to the problem description, any permutation of length 3 is valid. However, the program reverses the elements at even indices, which for `n = 3` would result in the permutation `[3, 2, 1]`. This permutation is valid, but the program does not guarantee that it will always produce a valid permutation for `n = 3`. For example, if the input is `3`, the program will output `3 2 1`, which is valid, but if the input is `4`, the program will output `4 1 2 3`, which is also valid. However, the logic used in the program is not robust enough to ensure that all permutations generated for any `n` will be valid, especially as `n` increases. A more robust solution would be needed to ensure that the generated permutation meets the problem's requirements for all possible values of `n`.
