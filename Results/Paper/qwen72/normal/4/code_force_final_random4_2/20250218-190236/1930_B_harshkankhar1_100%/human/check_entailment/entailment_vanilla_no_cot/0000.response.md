Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Permutation Generation**: For each test case, the function `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Permutation Modification**: The line `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a`. This ensures that the permutation meets the required condition:
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that no two elements at even indices (or odd indices) are consecutive in the original order. This helps in breaking any potential divisibility patterns that could exist if the list were left in its original order.

4. **Output**: The program prints the modified permutation using `print(*a)`, which correctly outputs the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Verification:
- **Example 1**: For `n = 4`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[3, 2, 1, 4]`. This permutation is valid because:
  - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`
  - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 4`
  - No other pairs of indices satisfy the condition `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

- **Example 2**: For `n = 3`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, the list remains `[1, 2, 3]`. This permutation is valid because:
  - There are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the minimum value of `n` (which is 3) correctly.
- The program also handles larger values of `n` up to the constraint limit of `10^5`.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
