Precondition: **The function `func_1` should take a single integer `n` as an argument, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**
