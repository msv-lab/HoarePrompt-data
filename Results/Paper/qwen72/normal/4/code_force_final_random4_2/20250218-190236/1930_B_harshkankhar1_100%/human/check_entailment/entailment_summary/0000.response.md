### Reasoning:

The problem requires generating a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
3. `func_1` generates a list of integers from 1 to \( n \).
4. It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based indexing).
5. Finally, it prints the modified list.

Let's analyze the permutation generated by the program:
- The list \( a \) is initially \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \).
- Reversing the elements at even indices results in a list where the even-indexed elements (1, 3, 5, ...) are reversed, and the odd-indexed elements (2, 4, 6, ...) remain in their original order.

For example:
- If \( n = 4 \), the initial list is \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \). After reversing the even indices, the list becomes \( [4, 2, 3, 1] \).
- If \( n = 5 \), the initial list is \( [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \). After reversing the even indices, the list becomes \( [5, 2, 3, 4, 1] \).

Now, let's check if this permutation satisfies the problem's constraints:
- For any two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)), we need to ensure that \( p_i \) does not divide \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) does not divide \( p_{j+1} \).

In the generated permutation:
- The even-indexed elements are the largest values in descending order.
- The odd-indexed elements are the smallest values in ascending order.

This ensures that:
- The largest values (even-indexed) are not likely to divide the smallest values (odd-indexed) or vice versa.
- The largest values are not likely to divide each other, and the smallest values are not likely to divide each other, especially given the alternating pattern.

### Conclusion:
The program generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
