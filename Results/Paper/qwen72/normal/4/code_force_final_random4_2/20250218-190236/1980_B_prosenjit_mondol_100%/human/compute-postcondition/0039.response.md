Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second integer provided by the input minus 2, `k` is the third integer provided by the input minus 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f` of the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then `a[k]` is strictly less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is exactly equal to `x`.**
