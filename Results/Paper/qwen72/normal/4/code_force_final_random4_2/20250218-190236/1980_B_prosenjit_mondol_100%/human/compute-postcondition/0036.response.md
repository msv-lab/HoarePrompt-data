The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1.
   - `f` is the second integer provided by the input minus 2.
   - `k` is the third integer provided by the input minus 3.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - `x` is the integer at index `f` of the sorted list `a`.
   - If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the integer at index `k` of the sorted list `a` is greater than `x`.
   - Otherwise, if `a[k]` is less than `x`, it is strictly less than `x`.
   - If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, it is exactly equal to `x`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Determination:**
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `_`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
