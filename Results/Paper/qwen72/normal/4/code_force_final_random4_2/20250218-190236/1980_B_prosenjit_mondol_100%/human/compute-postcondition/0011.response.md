Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it's irrelevant).
2. `n` is greater than 0 (This variable is also not used in the code snippet, so it's irrelevant).
3. `f` is `f - 1` (This means that `f` is one less than its previous value. However, the initial value of `f` is not provided, so we need to infer it from the context).
4. `k` is an integer provided by the input minus 1 (This means `k` is the index of an element in the list `a`).
5. `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
6. `x` is the integer at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `a`.
7. The integer at index `k` of the list `a` is less than `x`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```
print('YES')
```

The print statement simply prints the string 'YES'. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of the print statement directly. They are used to set up the context in which the print statement is executed, but the print statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
