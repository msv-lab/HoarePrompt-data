Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is `f - 1`, `k` is an integer provided by the input minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `x` is the integer at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the integer at index `k` of the list `a` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, the integer at index `k` of the list `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, it is strictly less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, it is exactly equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `f` is the second integer provided by the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer provided by the input minus 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `x` is the integer at index `f` of the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the integer at index `k` of the sorted list `a` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, if `a[k]` is less than `x`, it is strictly less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, it is exactly equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second integer provided by the input minus 2, `k` is the third integer provided by the input minus 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f` of the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then `a[k]` is strictly less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is exactly equal to `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
