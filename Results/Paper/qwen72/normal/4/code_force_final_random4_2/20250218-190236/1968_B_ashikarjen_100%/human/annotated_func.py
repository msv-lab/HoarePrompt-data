#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the smallest index in `b` such that `b[j]` matches `a[i]` for the last `i` where `b[j] == a[i]` and `j < m`, or `j` is `m` if no such match is found. `k` is the number of matches found between `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of matches found between the elements of `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, consisting of two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. The function then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`. It calculates the number of matches (`k`) between the characters of `a` and `b` by iterating through `a` and finding corresponding characters in `b`. The function prints the number of matches found (`k`) and does not return any value. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the code provided does not include the loop to process these test cases.
