### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` using `input()`.
   - It initializes two variables: `k` to count the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` to track the current position in `b`.

3. **Loop to Find the Subsequence:**
   - The program iterates over each character in `a` using a `for` loop with index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a `while` loop to find the same character in `b` starting from position `j`.
   - If it finds the character `a[i]` in `b[j]`, it increments `k` and moves to the next position in `b` by incrementing `j`.
   - If it reaches the end of `b` without finding the character `a[i]`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for finding the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is implemented correctly:
  - It iterates through each character of `a` and tries to find a matching character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
  - If a match is found, it moves to the next character in `a` and the next position in `b`.
  - If a match is not found, it breaks the loop, ensuring that the prefix length is correctly determined.
- The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `b` does not contain the character '1' (as in the sixth example).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
