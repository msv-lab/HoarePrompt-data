Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `j` is less than `m + 1`, and `k` is increased by 1.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `m + 1`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
