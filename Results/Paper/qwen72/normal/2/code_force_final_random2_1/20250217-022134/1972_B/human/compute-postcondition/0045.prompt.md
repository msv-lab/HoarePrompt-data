You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually accept parameters `t`, a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0, `index` is `1 + 2 * t_initial`, where `t_initial` is the initial value of `t`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even. The final `results` list will have `t_initial` elements.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `index` is `1 + 2 * t_initial`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even, and `results` has exactly `t_initial` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `t` of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". It returns a list of results for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
