Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `index` is calculated as `1 + 2 * t_initial`. Since `t_initial` is not explicitly defined, we assume it is the same as `t`, which is 0. Therefore, `index` is `1 + 2 * 0 = 1`.
   - `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even.
   - `results` must have at least two elements.
   - `result` is the second element in the list `results`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Determination:**
   - Since `index` is 1, and `result` is the second element in the list `results`, `result` will be `results[1]`.
   - The list `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of 'U' in the corresponding strings. Since `results` must have at least two elements, `results[1]` will be either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be one of these two values:

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where 'YES' or 'NO' is the second element in the list `results`)**
