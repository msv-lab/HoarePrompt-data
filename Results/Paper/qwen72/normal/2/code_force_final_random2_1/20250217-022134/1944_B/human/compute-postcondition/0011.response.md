Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the last `n` elements of `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is now 2 * k, `req` is 2 * k.**

Explanation:
- The variable `req` is assigned the value of `k`.
- Since `k` was previously updated to `2 * k`, `req` is now equal to `2 * k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
