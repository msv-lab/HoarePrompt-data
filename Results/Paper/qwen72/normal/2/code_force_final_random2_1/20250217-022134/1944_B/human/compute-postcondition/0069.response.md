Output State: **`k` is set to `req`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans2` now contains the element `c[2]`.**
