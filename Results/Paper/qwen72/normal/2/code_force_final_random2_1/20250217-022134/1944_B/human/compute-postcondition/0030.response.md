The value of `k` is decremented by 2. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` twice, `k` is `k - 2`.**
