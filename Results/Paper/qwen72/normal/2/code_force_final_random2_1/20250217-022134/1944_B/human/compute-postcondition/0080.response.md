Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n` (indicating the loop has completed its full range), `k` will be `req - 2 * m` where `m` is the number of times a consecutive duplicate was found, and `ans2` will contain the elements from `c` that were consecutive duplicates, each appended twice. The values of `n`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, if `k` is not zero and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`, `k` is decreased by 2 and `c[i]` is appended twice to `ans2`.
- The loop breaks if `k` reaches 0 before the end of the range.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` because the loop runs until `i` reaches `n`.
- The value of `k` will be `req - 2 * m`, where `m` is the number of times a consecutive duplicate was found.
- `ans2` will contain the elements from `c` that were consecutive duplicates, each appended twice.
- The values of `n`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
