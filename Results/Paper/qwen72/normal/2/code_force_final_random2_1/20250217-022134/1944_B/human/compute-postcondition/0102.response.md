Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` will be `n` after the loop completes, indicating the loop has run through all iterations.
- `k` will be `req - n`, where `n` is the length of the list `l`.
- `ans2` will contain the first `min(n, req)` elements of the list `l`, each appended once.
- `n`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans2)
```

### Analysis:
- The `*` operator in the `print` function is used to unpack the elements of the list `ans2` and print them separated by spaces.
- `ans2` contains the first `min(n, req)` elements of the list `l`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Determine the length of `l`**: Let `n` be the length of the list `l`.
2. **Determine the number of elements in `ans2`**: `ans2` will contain the first `min(n, req)` elements of `l`.
3. **Unpack and print the elements**: The `print` function will unpack these elements and print them separated by spaces.

### Example:
- Suppose `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `req = 3`.
  - `n` is 5 (length of `l`).
  - `ans2` will contain the first `min(5, 3)` elements of `l`, which are `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - The `print` statement will output: `1 2 3`.

### General Case:
- If `req <= n`, `ans2` will contain the first `req` elements of `l`.
- If `req > n`, `ans2` will contain all `n` elements of `l`.

### Final Output:
Output: **The first min(n, req) elements of l, separated by spaces**.
