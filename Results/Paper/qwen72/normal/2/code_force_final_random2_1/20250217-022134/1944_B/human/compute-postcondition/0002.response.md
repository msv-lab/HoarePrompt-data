The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `q` is 0**
