Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 2, 2, 3, and 3 of `b` if `b[2]` equals `b[1]` and `k` is -2, otherwise `ans1` includes the elements at indices 2, 3, and 3 of `b` and `l` includes the element `b[2]`, `k` is -2 if `b[2]` equals `b[1]` and `k` is not 0 if `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 3.
- The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of `b` to `ans1`.
- If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` initially includes the elements at indices 2, 2, and 3 of `b`. After appending `b[3]`, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 2, 2, 3, and 3 of `b`.
- If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, `ans1` initially includes the elements at indices 2 and 3 of `b`. After appending `b[3]`, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 2, 3, and 3 of `b`.
- The value of `k` remains -2 if `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, and `k` remains not 0 if `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`.
- The value of `n` remains at least 4.
- The value of `l` remains unchanged, including the element `b[2]` if `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`.
