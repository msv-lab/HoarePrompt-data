Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `len(l)` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `ans1` is updated by appending the value of `b[2]`.** 

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[2]` to the list `ans1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `len(l)`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new value of `ans1` includes the element `b[2]` appended to its previous state.
