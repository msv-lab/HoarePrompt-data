The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `b` to the list `ans1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 4
- `i` is 3
- If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 2 and 2 of `b`, and `k` is -2
- If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, `l` now includes the element `b[2]`
- If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

After executing the code snippet:
- The element at index `i` (which is 3) of the list `b` is appended to `ans1`.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `n` remains at least 4.
- The conditions regarding `b[2]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` remains -2 if `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, and the value of `l` remains unchanged if `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 2, 2, and 3 of `b` if `b[2]` equals `b[1]` and `k` is -2, otherwise `ans1` includes the elements at indices 2 and 3 of `b` and `l` includes the element `b[2]`, `k` is -2 if `b[2]` equals `b[1]` and `k` is not 0 if `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`.**
