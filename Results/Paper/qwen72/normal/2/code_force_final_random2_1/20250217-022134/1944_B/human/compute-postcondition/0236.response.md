Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `len(l)` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `ans1` is updated by appending the value of `b[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The value of `n` is greater than 3.
- The length of list `l` is 2.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.
- The list `ans1` is updated by appending the value of `b[2]`. Since `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of list `b` is appended to `ans1`.
