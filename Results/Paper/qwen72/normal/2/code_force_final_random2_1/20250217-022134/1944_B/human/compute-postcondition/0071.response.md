Output State: **`k` is set to `req - 2`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decreased by 2, so `k` is now `req - 2`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same: if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
