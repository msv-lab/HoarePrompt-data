Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3. If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` includes the elements at indices 2, 3, and 3 of `b`, and `k` is -4. If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, `l` includes the element `b[2]`, and `k` is -2. Additionally, if `b[3]` does not equal `b[4]`, `l` includes the element `b[3]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
