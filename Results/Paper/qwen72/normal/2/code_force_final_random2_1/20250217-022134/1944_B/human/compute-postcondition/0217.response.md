The code `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans1` initially contains the last element of `b`.
- `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` and is sorted.
- `n` is the length of `b`.

After executing the code:
- `ans1` will now contain two elements: the last element of `b` (which was already in `ans1`) and the last element of `b` again.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` is either `[b[0]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or remains an empty list otherwise, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `2 * (k - len(l))`, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` and is now sorted, `c` is now the slice of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (k - len(l))`.**
