The value of `b[i]` is appended to the list `l`. The conditions regarding `n`, `k`, and the elements of `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. `l` now includes the value of `b[i]`.**
