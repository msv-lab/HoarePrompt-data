Output State: **`k` is set to `req`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans1` will contain pairs of elements from `b` that are consecutive duplicates, `l` will contain elements from `b` that do not have consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of the list `c` to the list `ans2`.
- Initially, `ans2` contains the element `c[2]`.
- After executing the code, `ans2` now contains two instances of `c[2]`.
- All other variables (`k`, `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`) remain unchanged.
