Output State: **`i` will be the original `n`, `k` will be the second integer from the input, `ans2` will contain the first `min(original n, req)` elements of `l`, each appended once, `n` is the first integer from the input, `ans1` and `l` remain unchanged, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts using spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `a`.
- The values of `i`, `k`, `ans2`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`, and `q` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.
- The new variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.
