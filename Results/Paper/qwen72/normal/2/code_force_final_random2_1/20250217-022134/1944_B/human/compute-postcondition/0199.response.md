Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans1` contains all elements of the list `l`.
- The loop has completed all iterations, so `ans1` will contain all elements of `l`.

Given this information, the `print(*ans1)` statement will print all elements of `ans1` separated by spaces.

Output: **all elements of l (where l is the list containing the elements processed during the loop)**

This means that if `l` was initially `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output would be:

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
