The value of `t` is assigned the integer value of the user input. The other conditions about `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged and still apply as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.**
