Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element `p_i` satisfies |p_i| ≤ n, representing the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array `a`. The function returns the value stored at the index `final_sum` in the list `dp`. Here, `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, where `p[-1]` is the last element of the list `p`, and `offset` is a value used in the calculation of `final_sum`. The list `dp` has a length of `2 * n + 1`, and its elements are updated according to certain rules during the function's execution.**
