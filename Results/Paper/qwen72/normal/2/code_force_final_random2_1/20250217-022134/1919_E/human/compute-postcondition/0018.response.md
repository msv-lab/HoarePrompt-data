Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index `index` to index `index + n - 1`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 3 + 2*n, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The code `result = func_1(n, p)` assigns the value returned by the function `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`.
- Since `result` was already the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` before this assignment, the value of `result` remains unchanged.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `results`) are not affected by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with no changes to the values of the variables.
