The code snippet updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` based on the current value of `dp[j]`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `j` is 1.
   - `2 * n + 1` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros.
   - If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then `new_dp[1]` is set to `(dp[0]) % MOD` provided that `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - If `j - 1` is less than 0, an `IndexError` occurs because `j - 1` is -1, which is out of bounds for the list `new_dp`.
   - If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, the state remains unchanged.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]`.
   - Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2.
   - The value of `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`.

3. **Impact**:
   - `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`.
   - All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `j` is 1.
   - `2 * n + 1` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros, except `new_dp[2]` which is now `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`.
   - If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then `new_dp[1]` is set to `(dp[0]) % MOD` provided that `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - If `j - 1` is less than 0, an `IndexError` occurs because `j - 1` is -1, which is out of bounds for the list `new_dp`.
   - If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `new_dp[2]` which is now `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then `new_dp[1]` is set to `(dp[0]) % MOD` provided that `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. If `j - 1` is less than 0, an `IndexError` occurs because `j - 1` is -1, which is out of bounds for the list `new_dp`. If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, the state remains unchanged.**
