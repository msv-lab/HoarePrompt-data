You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `n` remains a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). The list `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1`, where each element has been updated according to the rules defined in the loop. Specifically, starting from the initial state where `dp[n]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, the loop updates `dp` such that for each index `j` in the range [0, 2 * n], if `dp[j]` was greater than 0 at any point, the adjacent elements `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` (if within bounds) have been incremented by the value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`. After `n` iterations, the final state of `dp` reflects the cumulative effect of these updates. The variable `i` is `n + 1`, and `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it is overwritten in each iteration.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value stored at the index `final_sum` in the list `dp`. Here, `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, where `p[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `p` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but assumed to be part of the context leading to `final_sum`), and `offset` is a value that is also not explicitly defined but is part of the calculation for `final_sum`. The list `dp` has a length of `2 * n + 1`, and its elements have been updated according to certain loop rules, which are not detailed here. The exact value returned depends on the specific values of `p[-1]`, `offset`, and the updates made to `dp` during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element `p_i` satisfies |p_i| ≤ n, representing the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array `a`. The function returns the value stored at the index `final_sum` in the list `dp`. Here, `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, where `p[-1]` is the last element of the list `p`, and `offset` is a value used in the calculation of `final_sum`. The list `dp` has a length of `2 * n + 1`, and its elements are updated according to certain rules during the function's execution.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value stored at the index `final_sum` in the list `dp`. Here, `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, where `p[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `p` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but assumed to be part of the context leading to `final_sum`), and `offset` is a value that is also not explicitly defined but is part of the calculation for `final_sum`. The list `dp` has a length of `2 * n + 1`, and its elements have been updated according to certain loop rules, which are not detailed here. The exact value returned depends on the specific values of `p[-1]`, `offset`, and the updates made to `dp` during the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
