The value of `result` is appended to the list `results`. The list `results` initially contains two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`. After appending `result`, which is also the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `results` now contains three elements, all of which are the same value.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the current iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index `index` to index `index + n - 1`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 4 + 3*n, `results` is a list containing three elements where each element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**
