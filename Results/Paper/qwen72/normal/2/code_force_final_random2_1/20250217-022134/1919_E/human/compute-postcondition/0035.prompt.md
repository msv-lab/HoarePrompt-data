Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0 (since it dictates the number of iterations and has been fully consumed), `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for res in results:
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is 0, `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is 0, `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, `res` is the second element in the list `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing at least three elements, `t` is 0, `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, `res` is the third element in the list `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
