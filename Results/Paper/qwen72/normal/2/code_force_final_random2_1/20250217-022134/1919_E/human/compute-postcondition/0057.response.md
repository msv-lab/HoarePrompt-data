To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(2 * n + 1):
```

The loop head involves the variable `j` and the expression `2 * n + 1`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means `2 * n + 1` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `j` is `2 * n`
- `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0
- `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The key points are:
- `2 * n + 1` must be greater than 0 (which is already true given \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\))
- `j` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start correctly

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `n` remains a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `j` is 0 (initial value for the loop)
- `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0 (already true)
- `i` remains `n`
- `new_dp` remains a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0
- `dp` remains equal to `new_dp`

State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 0, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0, and `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`**
