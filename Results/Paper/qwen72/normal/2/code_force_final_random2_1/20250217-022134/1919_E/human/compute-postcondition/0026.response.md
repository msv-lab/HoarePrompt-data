Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the current iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index `index` to index `index + n - 1`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 4 + 3*n, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The code `result = func_1(n, p)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`.
- Since `results` already contains two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, the new assignment to `result` does not change the content of `results`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `result` is now the same as the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.
