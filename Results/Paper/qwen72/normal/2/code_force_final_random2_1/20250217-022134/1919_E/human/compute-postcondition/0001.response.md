The code snippet reads input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `data`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace.**
