Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is `2 * n`, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element has been updated based on the rules of the loop. Specifically, for each index `k` in the range `[0, 2 * n]`, if there was a non-zero value in `dp[k]` during any iteration, the adjacent elements `dp[k-1]` and `dp[k+1]` (if within bounds) have been incremented by the value of `dp[k]` modulo `MOD`. `new_dp` is now equal to `dp`.**
