Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the current iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index `index` to index `index + n - 1`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 3 + 2*n, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `n` is derived from the current value of `index`, which is 3 + 2 * (previous value of `n`).
