The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` is already defined as the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, and `results` initially contains this same value, appending `result` to `results` means that `results` now contains two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index `index` to index `index + n - 1`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 3 + 2*n, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
