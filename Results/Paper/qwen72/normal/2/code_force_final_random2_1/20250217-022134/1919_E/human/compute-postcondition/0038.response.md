Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 0, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, and `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then `new_dp[1]` is set to `(dp[0]) % MOD` provided that `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. If `j - 1` is less than 0, an `IndexError` occurs because `j - 1` is -1, which is out of bounds for the list `new_dp`. If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, the state remains unchanged.***
