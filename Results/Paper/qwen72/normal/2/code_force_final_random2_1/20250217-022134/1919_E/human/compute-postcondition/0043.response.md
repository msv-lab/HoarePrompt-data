Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros, and `new_dp[0]` is set to `(dp[1]) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `j` is 1, so `j - 1` is 0.
- The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
- Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0, and the code sets `new_dp[0]` to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD`.
- Initially, `new_dp[0]` is 0, so `new_dp[0]` becomes `(0 + dp[1]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp[1] % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
