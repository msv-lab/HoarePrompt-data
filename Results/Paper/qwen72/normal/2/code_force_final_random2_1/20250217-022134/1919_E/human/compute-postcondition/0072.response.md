The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the expression `2 * n + 1`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `j` is 1
- `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]` which is `dp[0] % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.
- If `dp[j]` (which is `dp[1]`) is greater than 0, `new_dp[j + 1]` (which is `new_dp[2]`) is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Additionally, if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[0]` is updated to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD`.
- If `dp[j]` (which is `dp[1]`) is 0, no changes are made to `new_dp`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and the condition `j < 2 * n + 1` must still hold true. Since `j` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `2 * n + 1` remains unchanged as it is determined by `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]` and `new_dp[2]` which are updated based on the conditions described above, `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.**
