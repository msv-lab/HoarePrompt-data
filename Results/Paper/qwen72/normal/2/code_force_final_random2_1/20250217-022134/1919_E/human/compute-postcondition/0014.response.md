The code snippet updates the value of `n` by converting the string at `data[index]` to an integer. Given that `index` is 2 + n, the new value of `n` is determined by the content of `data[2 + n]`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, the new value of `n` will also be a positive integer, but its exact value depends on the content of `data`.

The other variables (`t`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index 2 to index 2 + n - 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 2 + n, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
