The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the current iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index `index` to index `index + n - 1`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 3 + 2*n, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**
