The code updates the element at index `j + 1` in the list `new_dp` by adding the value of `dp[j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `j` is 2.
- `2 * n + 1` is greater than 2.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros.

The code snippet:
```python
new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
```

1. `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
2. `new_dp[3]` is updated to `(new_dp[3] + dp[2]) % MOD`.
3. Since `new_dp` is initially all zeros, `new_dp[3]` is `0`.
4. Therefore, `new_dp[3]` becomes `dp[2] % MOD`.

The values of `n`, `j`, `i`, and the length of `new_dp` remain unchanged. The only change is in `new_dp[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 2, `i` is `n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `new_dp[3]` which is `dp[2] % MOD`.**
