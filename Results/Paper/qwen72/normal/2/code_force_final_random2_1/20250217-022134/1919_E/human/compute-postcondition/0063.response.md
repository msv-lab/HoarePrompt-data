Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 0, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]` which is `dp[0] % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`, `dp[j]` (which is `dp[0]`) is greater than 0, `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
- Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1, and `new_dp[-1]` is updated to `(new_dp[-1] + dp[0]) % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
