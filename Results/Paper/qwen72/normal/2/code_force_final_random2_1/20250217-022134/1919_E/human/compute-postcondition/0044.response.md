Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[0]` is set to `(dp[1]) % MOD`. If `j - 1` is less than 0, an `IndexError` occurs because `j - 1` is -1, which is out of bounds for the list `new_dp`.***
