Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is `2 * n`, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, and `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element has been updated based on the rules defined in the loop. Specifically, for each `j` from 0 to `2 * n` inclusive, if `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` (if within bounds) are updated by adding `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- The variable `j` has reached the value `2 * n`.
- The condition `2 * n + 1` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains `n + 1`.
- The list `new_dp` has been updated such that for each index `j` from 0 to `2 * n` inclusive, if the corresponding value in `dp` is greater than 0, the adjacent elements in `new_dp` (i.e., `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` if they are within bounds) are incremented by the value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.
