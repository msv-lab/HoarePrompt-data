Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]`, `new_dp[2]`, and if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, `new_dp[3]` is set to `dp[2] % MOD`. `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.***
