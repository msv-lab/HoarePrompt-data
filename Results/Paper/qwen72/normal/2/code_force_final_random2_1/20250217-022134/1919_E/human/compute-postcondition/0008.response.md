Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is now equal to the integer value of `data[1]`.**
