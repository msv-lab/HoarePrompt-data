### Reasoning:

#### Initial Analysis:
- **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of possible arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that the sorted prefix sums of `a` match the given sorted prefix sums `p`.

#### Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:
- **Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to cover all possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices.
- **Transition**: For each element in the array `a`, the program updates the DP array to reflect the possible new prefix sums by adding either `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
- **Final Result**: The final prefix sum is calculated by adding the last element of `p` to the `offset`. The result is retrieved from the `dp` array at the corresponding index.

#### Input Handling:
- **Reading Input**: The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Smallest Input**: For `n = 1`, the program correctly handles the cases where `p` is `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[-1]`.
- **Larger Inputs**: The program handles larger inputs up to the constraints (`n = 5000`).
- **Repetitive Values**: The program correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` has repeated values or negative values.

#### Annotations and State Transitions:
- **Initial State**: The program starts with valid inputs and initializes the DP array correctly.
- **DP Updates**: The DP transitions are correctly implemented, ensuring that the possible prefix sums are updated based on the current state.
- **Final State**: The final state of the DP array is used to retrieve the result, which is the number of valid arrays `a` that can produce the given prefix sums `p`.

### Evaluation:
- **Correctness**: The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The initialization, transition, and final result retrieval are all handled correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases and larger inputs as expected.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling in `func_2` is correct and processes multiple test cases efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Final:
**True**
