Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `func_1` function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with a size of `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` variable is used to shift the indices so that negative sums can be represented in the DP array.

2. **DP Transition**: The DP transition is handled correctly. For each element in the array `a`, the program updates the DP array to reflect the possible new prefix sums that can be achieved by adding either `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum. This is done using the `new_dp` array, which is updated based on the current `dp` values.

3. **Final Result Calculation**: After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is calculated by adding the last element of `p` to the `offset`. The result is then retrieved from the `dp` array at the corresponding index.

4. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases correctly. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs up to the constraints (`n = 5000`). It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` has repeated values or negative values.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
