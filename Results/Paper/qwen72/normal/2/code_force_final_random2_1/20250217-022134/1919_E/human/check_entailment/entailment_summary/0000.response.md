### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to count the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only 1 and -1 such that the sorted prefix sums of `a` match the given sorted prefix sums `p`.
   - The prefix sums `p` are already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The result should be computed modulo 998,244,353.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, p)`**:
     - This function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
     - It initializes a `dp` array of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for the element at index `n` (the `offset`), which is set to 1.
     - The `dp` array is used to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
     - The function iterates `n` times, updating the `dp` array based on the current state.
     - Finally, it calculates the `final_sum` as the sum of the last element of `p` and the `offset`, and returns the value at the index `final_sum` in the `dp` array.
     - This approach correctly counts the number of ways to form the given prefix sums using dynamic programming.

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and the list `p`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and collects the results.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
     - This function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

3. **Overall Correctness:**
   - Both functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_1` correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid initial arrays `a`.
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
