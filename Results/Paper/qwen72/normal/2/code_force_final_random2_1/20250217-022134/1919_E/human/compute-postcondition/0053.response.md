The code snippet assigns the value of `new_dp` to `dp`. This means that the list `dp` now contains the same elements as `new_dp`, which was previously updated based on the rules defined in the loop.

Let's summarize the impact of this assignment:

- `dp` is now a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element has been updated based on the rules defined in the loop.
- The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0 remains true.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is `2 * n`, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, and `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element has been updated based on the rules defined in the loop.**
