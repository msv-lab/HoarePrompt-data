### Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` to handle all possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` variable is used to shift the indices so that negative sums can be represented.
   - This initialization is correct and necessary for the problem.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - The DP transition is implemented correctly. For each element in the array `a`, the program updates the DP array to reflect the possible new prefix sums by adding either `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
   - The use of `new_dp` to update the DP array ensures that the transitions are handled correctly without overwriting values prematurely.

3. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is calculated by adding the last element of `p` to the `offset`. The result is then retrieved from the `dp` array at the corresponding index.
   - This step is crucial for determining the number of valid arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases correctly. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.
   - The input handling is robust and follows the problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs up to the constraints (`n = 5000`).
   - It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` has repeated values or negative values.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles all edge cases as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
