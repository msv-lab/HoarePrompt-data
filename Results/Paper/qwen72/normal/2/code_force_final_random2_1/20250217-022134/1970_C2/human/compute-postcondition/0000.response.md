The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `t` are integers within certain ranges, the new values of `n` and `t` will be updated based on the input. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the input, `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node, `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, representing the starting node for the game.**
