Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `t` is updated to the value provided by the input, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default type list where `nodes[u]` now contains `[v, v, v]` and `nodes[v]` now contains `[u, u]`, `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are now specific integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `nodes[u].append(v)` adds `v` to the list `nodes[u]`.
- Initially, `nodes[u]` contained `[v, v]`. After appending `v`, `nodes[u]` now contains `[v, v, v]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
