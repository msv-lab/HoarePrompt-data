The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`.

- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `t` is an integer where t = 1, representing the number of rounds.
- `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to n and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node.
- `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the starting node for the game.

The function returns the result of a game played on a tree structure, starting from the specified `start` node and running for `t` rounds. The exact nature of the game's rules and the specific return value are not detailed, but the function is designed to process the tree structure and the game logic to produce a result.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `t` (the number of rounds, which is always 1), `nodes` (a dictionary representing the tree structure), and `start` (the starting node). It returns the result of a game played on the tree starting from the specified node and running for one round.**
