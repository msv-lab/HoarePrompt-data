### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" followed by `1` and `1`. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over the `costs` list, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` accordingly.
   - The variable `h` keeps track of the total number of jewels Alice can buy.
   - If `h < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
   - Otherwise, the program prints "YES", followed by `2` (the number of stalls), and the elements of the `costs` list.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation in `costs`:**
  - The list `costs` is initialized with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. However, this initialization is incorrect. The first element should be `n // k` to ensure that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.
  - The calculation of `h` and the subsequent logic are also flawed. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels using the minimum number of stalls.

### Corrected Logic:
- **Correct Initialization of `costs`:**
  - Initialize `costs` with the correct values to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - Use a loop to determine the minimum number of stalls required and their prices.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed initialization of the `costs` list and the subsequent logic. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
