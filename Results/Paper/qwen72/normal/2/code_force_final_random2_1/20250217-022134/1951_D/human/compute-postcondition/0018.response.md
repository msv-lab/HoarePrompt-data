The code snippet `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the value of `curr`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `h` is initially set to `curr`.
- `curr` is defined as `n // i`, which simplifies to `n` because `i` is 1.
- Therefore, `h` is initially `n`.

When `h += curr` is executed:
- `h` is incremented by `curr`, which is `n`.
- So, `h` becomes `n + n`, which is `2 * n`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is now `n - i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * n`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is 1, and `curr` is updated to `n // i`.**
