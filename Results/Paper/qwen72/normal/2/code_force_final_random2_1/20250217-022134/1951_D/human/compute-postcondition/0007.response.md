Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is less than `k`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions; it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
