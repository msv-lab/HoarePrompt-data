You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` (both within the range 1 to 10^18) as input. It prints 'YES' and the number 1 three times if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates a series of values and prints either 'NO' if the calculated sum `h` is less than `k`, or '2', 'YES', and the two elements of the list `costs` if `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not return any value in any case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `n == k` Case**: The program prints `YES` and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 when `n == k`. However, this is not always the optimal solution. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 10`, the program will output a single stall with a price of 1, which is correct. However, if `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the program will also output a single stall with a price of 1, which is correct, but it does not consider other cases where `n` and `k` might be different but still require a single stall.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**: The program attempts to calculate the costs for two stalls, but the logic is flawed. It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then tries to distribute the remaining coins among these two stalls. However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the program will output:
   ```
   2
   YES
   5 1
   ```
   This means Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (since 7 // 5 = 1) and 2 jewels from the second stall (since 2 // 1 = 2), totaling 3 jewels. This is correct, but the program does not handle more complex cases correctly.

3. **Handling of `h < k` Condition**: The program checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k` and prints `NO` if it is. However, this check is not comprehensive enough to cover all edge cases. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the program will output:
   ```
   2
   YES
   7 1
   ```
   This means Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (since 10 // 7 = 1) and 3 jewels from the second stall (since 3 // 1 = 3), totaling 4 jewels. This is correct, but the program does not handle cases where more than two stalls are needed.

4. **General Logic Flaw**: The program does not consider the possibility of setting up more than two stalls. The problem allows for up to 60 stalls, and the program should explore this option to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 100` and `k = 10`, the program will output:
   ```
   2
   YES
   91 1
   ```
   This means Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (since 100 // 91 = 1) and 9 jewels from the second stall (since 9 // 1 = 9), totaling 10 jewels. This is correct, but the program does not handle cases where more than two stalls are needed to achieve the desired result.

To summarize, the program fails to handle cases where more than two stalls are required and does not provide a general solution that works for all potential inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
