To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is the initial value of `n`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `k` is the third integer from the input
- `s` is 0
- `c` is `k * k / 2`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` is set by the loop itself and starts at 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` is 0, which is set by the loop itself.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`, and the list `l` is now a sorted list of integers from the input.**
