Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) for j in range(n)) - sum(min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for _ in range(n))`, `k` is now `k - n * min(m, k)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as the initial value of `n`, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - n * min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, and `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is now `k - n * s` (where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`), `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`, and the list `l` is now a sorted list of integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
