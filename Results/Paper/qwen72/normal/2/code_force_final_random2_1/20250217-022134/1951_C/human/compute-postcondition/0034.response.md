Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 1, `l[i]` refers to the second element in the sorted list `l`.
- The new value of `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
