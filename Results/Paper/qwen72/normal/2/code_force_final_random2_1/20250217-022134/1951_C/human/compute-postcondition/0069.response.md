Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is `2 * s + s`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * l[1] + s * l[2] + 3 * s^2`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `s` from its current value.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `t`, `c`, `s`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is the third integer from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus `s`.
