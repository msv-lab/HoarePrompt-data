Let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` and `k` are positive integers.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- `c` is computed as follows:
  \[
  c = k \times k / 2 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] \times \min(m, k) - \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \min(m, k) \times \min(m, k) / 2
  \]
- `k` is updated to `k - n \times \min(m, k)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   \[
   s = \min(m, k)
   \]

2. **Compute the first term of `c`**:
   \[
   k \times k / 2
   \]

3. **Compute the second term of `c`**:
   \[
   \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] \times \min(m, k)
   \]
   This is the sum of each element in `l` multiplied by `s`.

4. **Compute the third term of `c`**:
   \[
   \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \min(m, k) \times \min(m, k) / 2
   \]
   This is the sum of `s * s / 2` repeated `n` times, which simplifies to:
   \[
   n \times (s \times s / 2)
   \]

5. **Combine the terms to get `c`**:
   \[
   c = k \times k / 2 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] \times s - n \times (s \times s / 2)
   \]

6. **Update `k`**:
   \[
   k = k - n \times s
   \]

### Final Computation:
- The value of `c` is computed as described above.
- The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer part of `c`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the calculation:
- `n = 3`
- `m = 5`
- `k = 7`
- `l = [1, 2, 3]`

1. **Determine `s`**:
   \[
   s = \min(5, 7) = 5
   \]

2. **Compute the first term of `c`**:
   \[
   k \times k / 2 = 7 \times 7 / 2 = 24.5
   \]

3. **Compute the second term of `c`**:
   \[
   \sum_{j=0}^{2} l[j] \times 5 = 1 \times 5 + 2 \times 5 + 3 \times 5 = 5 + 10 + 15 = 30
   \]

4. **Compute the third term of `c`**:
   \[
   n \times (s \times s / 2) = 3 \times (5 \times 5 / 2) = 3 \times 12.5 = 37.5
   \]

5. **Combine the terms to get `c`**:
   \[
   c = 24.5 + 30 - 37.5 = 17
   \]

6. **Update `k`**:
   \[
   k = 7 - 3 \times 5 = 7 - 15 = -8
   \]

### Final Output:
The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer part of `c`, which is 17.

Output: **17**
