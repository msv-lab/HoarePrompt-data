Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, and `s` is now `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- Since `m` is `b` and `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, the new value of `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
