The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is equal to `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is now `k - s`.**
