Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The variable `c` should be used to accumulate the total cost of purchasing tickets, starting from 0.

2. **Incorrect Logic in the Loop**: The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the line `s = min(m, k)` correctly determines the number of tickets to buy on the current day, but the subsequent line `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The term `- s * s / 2` is not necessary and does not correspond to any part of the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Final Output**: The final output is calculated using `int(c)`, but due to the incorrect initialization and accumulation of `c`, the result will be wrong.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        
        total_cost = 0
        while k > 0:
            for i in range(n):
                if k == 0:
                    break
                tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
                total_cost += l[i] * tickets_to_buy
                k -= tickets_to_buy
                l[i] += tickets_to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that the total cost is correctly accumulated and that the number of tickets purchased each day is adjusted according to the problem's constraints.
