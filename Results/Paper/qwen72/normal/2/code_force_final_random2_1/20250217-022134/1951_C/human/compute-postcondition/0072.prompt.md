Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    t = 0
    s = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        c += s * (l[i] + t)
        t += s
        k -= s
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same as initially provided, `m` remains the same as initially provided, `l` remains the same as initially provided, `t` is the total sum of `s` over all iterations, `c` is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` over all iterations, `s` is the last computed minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is the initial `k` minus the total sum of `s` over all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is the initial `k` minus the total sum of `s` over all iterations, `l` remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is the total sum of `s` over all iterations, `c` is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, and `s` is the last computed value of `min(m, k)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same as the first integer from the input, `m` remains the same as the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus `n * s` where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`, `l` remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is `n * s`, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
