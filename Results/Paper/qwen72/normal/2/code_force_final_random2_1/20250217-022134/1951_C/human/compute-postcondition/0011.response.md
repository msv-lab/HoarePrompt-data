Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is equal to `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is now `k - s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- The value of `c` remains the same, which is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `l`) remain unchanged.
