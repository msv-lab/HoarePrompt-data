The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `l`.

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers.
- `l` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
