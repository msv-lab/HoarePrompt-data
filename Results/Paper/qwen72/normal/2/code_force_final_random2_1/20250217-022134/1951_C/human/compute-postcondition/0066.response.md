Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is `s + s`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + s)`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `s` is used in the expressions for `t` and `c`, but these expressions themselves are not recalculated in this code snippet.
