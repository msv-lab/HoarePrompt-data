Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. The correct initialization should be `c = 0` because we are summing up the costs of tickets.
   - The update to `c` inside the loop is also incorrect. The line `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` does not correctly account for the cost of tickets purchased on each day. It should simply be `c += l[i] * s`.

2. **Handling of `k`**:
   - The program correctly reduces `k` by the number of tickets purchased (`s`) on each day. However, the loop should continue until `k` reaches 0, but the current implementation does not handle this properly.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is less than `m`. For example, if `k` is 1 and `m` is 10, the program should purchase 1 ticket on the cheapest day, but it might not do so correctly due to the incorrect calculation of `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
            if k == 0:
                break
        print(c)
```

This corrected version initializes `c` to 0, correctly updates `c` by adding the cost of tickets purchased on each day, and ensures that the loop stops once all required tickets are purchased.
