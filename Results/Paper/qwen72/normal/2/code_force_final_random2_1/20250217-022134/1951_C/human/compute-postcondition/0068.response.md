Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is `2 * s + s`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * l[1] + s * l[2] + 3 * s^2`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `2 * s + s`, which simplifies to `3 * s`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
