Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `m` is `b`
- `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, k)`
- `s` is `min(b, k)`
- `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`

### Code Snippet:
```python
c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `c` is updated.
   - `l[i]` is accessed, where `i` is 2.
   - `s` is used in the calculation.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is `min(b, k)`.

3. **Update `c`:**
   - The new value of `c` is calculated as:
     \[
     c = c + l[2] * s - s * s / 2
     \]

### Updated State:
- `c` is now:
  \[
  c = k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2 + l[2] * s - s * s / 2
  \]
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, k)`, `s` is `min(b, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2 + l[2] * s - s * s / 2`.**
