Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same as the first integer from the input, `m` remains the same as the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus `n * s` where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`, `l` remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is `n * s`, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations, so `i` is now `n-1`.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The value of `k` is reduced by `n * s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`.
- The list `l` remains the same as it was initially.
- The variable `t` is now `n * s`, reflecting the total increment over all iterations.
- The variable `c` is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for each index `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`, which is consistent throughout the loop.
