Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now `k * k / 2 + 2 * l[i] * s - s * s`, `k` is now `k - min(m, k) - s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `s` (which is the minimum of `m` and `k`) from its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is `k - s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
