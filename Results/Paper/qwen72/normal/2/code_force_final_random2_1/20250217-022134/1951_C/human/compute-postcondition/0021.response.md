The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This means the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten with the new values provided by the input.

Let's assume the input values are `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. After executing the code:

- `n` is now `a`
- `m` is now `b`
- `k` is now `c`

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged. However, since `n` and `k` have been updated, the expressions involving these variables will also change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `a`, `n` is `a`, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `b` and `c`, `c` is now `c * c / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(b, c) for j in range(a)) - sum(min(b, c) * min(b, c) / 2 for _ in range(a))`, `k` is now `c - a * min(b, c)`.**
