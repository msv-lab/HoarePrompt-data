The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `l`. This impacts the initial state by updating the value of `l` and potentially affecting the subsequent calculations involving `l`.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `l` is updated to a new list of integers from the input.
- The initial state specifies that `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, so after this line, `l` will still be a list of integers, but it may not necessarily be sorted unless the input was already sorted.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the initial value of `n`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`, and the list `l` is now a list of integers from the input (not necessarily sorted).**
