Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `a`, `n` is `a`, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c)`, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated to `k * k / 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `l`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `c` is calculated based on the current value of `k`.
