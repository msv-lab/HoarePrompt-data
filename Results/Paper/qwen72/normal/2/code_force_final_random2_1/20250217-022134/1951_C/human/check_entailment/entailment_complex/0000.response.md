Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, with constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day (`m`) and the increasing ticket prices after each purchase. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the list `l` of ticket prices. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to always consider the lowest available prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**: The program initializes `s` and `c`. However, the initialization of `c` as `k * k / 2` seems incorrect. The variable `c` should be initialized to 0, as it is meant to accumulate the total cost.

4. **Loop to Purchase Tickets**: The program iterates over the sorted list of prices and attempts to purchase the maximum possible number of tickets (`min(m, k)`) at each price. It updates the remaining number of tickets `k` and adds the cost of the purchased tickets to `c`.

5. **Cost Calculation**: The formula used to update `c` is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
   ```python
   c += l[i] * s
   ```
   The term `- s * s / 2` is unnecessary and incorrect in this context.

6. **Final Output**: The program prints the final cost `c` for each test case. However, due to the incorrect initialization and update of `c`, the output will be incorrect.

Given these points, the program is incorrect due to the following issues:
- Incorrect initialization of `c`.
- Incorrect update of `c` during the loop.

Corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
        print(c)
```

Correctness: **False**
