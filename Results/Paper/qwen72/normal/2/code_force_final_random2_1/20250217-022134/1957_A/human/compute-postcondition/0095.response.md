Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least one element, `pl` is a list. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` is `None`, then `d` has the key `i` set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in the new `palka` that appear 3 or more times.***
