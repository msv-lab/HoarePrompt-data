You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Output

Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr`, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 4. After the function concludes, the original list `arr` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the total number of groups of 4 sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`. This is done correctly by iterating over the list `arr` and updating the count for each stick length.

3. **Polygon Formation**: The program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. A regular polygon requires at least 3 sides, but the program is only considering polygons with 4 sides (squares). This is a limitation in the logic, as it does not account for other possible regular polygons (e.g., triangles, pentagons, etc.).

4. **Summation**: The program sums up the number of squares that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 and taking the integer part. This is correct for counting squares but not for other types of polygons.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the sum of the number of squares that can be formed.

Given the problem statement, the program is only partially correct because it only considers squares and not other regular polygons. However, if we assume that the problem is specifically asking for the maximum number of squares that can be formed, then the program is correct.

However, since the problem statement asks for the maximum number of regular polygons (not just squares), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
