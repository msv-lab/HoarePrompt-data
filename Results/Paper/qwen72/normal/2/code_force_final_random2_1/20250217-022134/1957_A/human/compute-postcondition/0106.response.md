Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least three elements, `pl` is a list that now includes the fourth element of `palka` if it was not already present, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in the new `palka` that appear 3 or more times.**
