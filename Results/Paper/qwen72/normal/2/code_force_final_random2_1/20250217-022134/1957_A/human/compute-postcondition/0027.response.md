Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100.
- The variable `w` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `ln` remains an input integer.
- The list `palka` has been fully iterated over, meaning all elements in `palka` have been processed.
- The list `pl` now contains all unique integers from `palka`.
- The dictionary `d` now contains keys for each unique integer in `palka`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.
