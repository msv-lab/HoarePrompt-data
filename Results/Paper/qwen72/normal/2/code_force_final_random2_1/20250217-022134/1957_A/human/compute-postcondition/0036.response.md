Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 2 unique integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1, where `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`.***
