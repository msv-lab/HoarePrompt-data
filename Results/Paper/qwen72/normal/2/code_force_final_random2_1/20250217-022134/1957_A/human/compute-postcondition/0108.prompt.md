Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in the new `palka` that appear 3 or more times.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least one element, `pl` is a list. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` is `None`, then `d` has the key `i` set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in the new `palka` that appear 3 or more times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least two elements, `pl` is a list. If `i` (the third element in `palka`) was not in `pl`, then `i` is now added to `pl`. `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` has the key `i` set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in the new `palka` that appear 3 or more times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least three elements, `pl` is a list. If the fourth element of `palka` (denoted as `i`) was not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`. The dictionary `d` is updated such that if `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in the new `palka` that appear 3 or more times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
