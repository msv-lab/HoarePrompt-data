Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive; `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for n in arr:
    freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and its value is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the second element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its value is 1, and `n` as a key with a value of 1 if `n` was not previously in `freq`, or the value of `n` is incremented by 1 if `n` was already in `freq`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the third element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key and its value is 1, the second element of `arr` as a key with a value of 1 if it was not previously in `freq`, or the value of the second element is incremented by 1 if it was already in `freq`, and the third element `n` as a key with a value of 1 if it was not previously in `freq`, or the value of `n` is incremented by 1 if it was already in `freq`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
