Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl`. If `d.get(i)` is None, `d` now has the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the integer `i`. If `d.get(i)` is None, `d` now has the key `i` set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the integer `i`. If `d.get(i)` was None, `d` now has the key `i` set to 1. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `palka` must have at least one more element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
