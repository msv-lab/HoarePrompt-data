To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
   - `w` is greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `palka` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
   - `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `palka` is a list of integers provided as input.
   - `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
   - `d` is a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each element in `palka`.
   - `shapes` is the count of elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

3. **Calculating `shapes`:**
   - For each element in `pl`, check if it appears at least 3 times in `palka` using the dictionary `d`.
   - Count how many such elements exist.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will print the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the count of elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the count of elements in pl that appear at least 3 times in palka)**
