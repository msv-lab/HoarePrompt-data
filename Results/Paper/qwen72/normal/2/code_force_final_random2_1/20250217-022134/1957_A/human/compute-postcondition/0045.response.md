Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**
