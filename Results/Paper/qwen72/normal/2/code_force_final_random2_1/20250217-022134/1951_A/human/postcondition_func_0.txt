The function `func_1` processes a series of inputs. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s`. Based on the count of '1' characters in `s` and the presence of the substring '11', it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The function does not modify any external state or return any values.
