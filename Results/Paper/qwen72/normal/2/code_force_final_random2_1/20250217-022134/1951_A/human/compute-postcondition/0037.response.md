Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If '11' is in `s`, the state remains unchanged. If '11' is not in `s`, the state also remains unchanged.**
