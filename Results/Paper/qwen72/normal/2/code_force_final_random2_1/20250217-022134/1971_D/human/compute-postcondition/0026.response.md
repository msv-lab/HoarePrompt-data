Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 4, `j` is 2, and `flag` is either True or False depending on the initial conditions. If `s[1]` is not equal to `s[2]`, and if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '1', then `flag` is True. If `s[j]` (which is `s[2]`) is '0' and `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[3]`) is '1', then `j` is updated to 3 and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `j` remains 2 and `flag` retains its initial value.***
