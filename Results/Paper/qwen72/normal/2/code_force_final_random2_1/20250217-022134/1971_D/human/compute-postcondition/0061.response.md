Output State: **`s` is the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 4. If `s[j-1]` is not equal to `s[j]`, then `flag` is set to True. The value of `count` remains 3 if `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`, or 4 if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`. If `s[j-1]` is equal to `s[j]`, `j` and `flag` retain their initial values, and `count` remains as initially set (2 if `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`, or 3 if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`).**
