Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `_` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `t % MOD`; `i` is `k-1`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD + t % MOD` and `ans` is now `ans % MOD`.**
