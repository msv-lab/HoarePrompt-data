Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least three elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`. If `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0, `t` is set to 0, and `ans` is `((s + 0) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (0 * (k-1)) % MOD`. Otherwise, `t` is `max(tmp, max(tmp, 0))`, and `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`.***
