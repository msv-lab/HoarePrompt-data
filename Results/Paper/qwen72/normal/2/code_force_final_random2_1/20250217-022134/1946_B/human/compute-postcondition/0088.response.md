To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for x in a:
```

The only object in the loop head is the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, `i`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `t` is 0
- `tmp` is 0
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`
- `i` is `k-1`

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` is not empty.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, `i` is `k-1`**
