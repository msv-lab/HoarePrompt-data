The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, and it starts from 0.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
