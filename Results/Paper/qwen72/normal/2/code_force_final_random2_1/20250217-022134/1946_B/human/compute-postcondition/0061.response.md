Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0, `x` is the third element in `a`. If `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains as the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0 plus the second element in `a` (or 0 if this sum is less than 0), and then `tmp` is updated to `tmp` plus the third element in `a`.***
