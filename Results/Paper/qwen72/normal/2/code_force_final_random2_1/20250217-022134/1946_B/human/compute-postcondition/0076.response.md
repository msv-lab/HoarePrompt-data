The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `k-1`. If `i` is less than `k-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have executed at least once.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `k-1` must be greater than 2, or equivalently, `k` must be greater than 3.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(4 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t` % MOD + `t` % MOD, `i` is 2**
