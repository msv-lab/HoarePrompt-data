Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `x` is the first element in `a`. If `tmp` (which is initially the first element in `a`) is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the second element in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the third element in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the previous value of `t`, and `tmp` is updated to `tmp` + `x`. If `tmp` was initially less than 0, `t` remains 0 and `tmp` is now 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
