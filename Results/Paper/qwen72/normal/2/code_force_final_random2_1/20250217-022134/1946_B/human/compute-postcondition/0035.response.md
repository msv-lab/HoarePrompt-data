To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is now `(t * 2) % MOD`.
- `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative.
- `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD`.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `k - 1`.
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop condition is `i < k - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

### Updated State:
- `T` remains the same.
- `_` remains the same.
- `n` and `k` remain the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `tmp` remains the same.
- `ans` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented to 2.

### Final State:
State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `(t * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD`, `i` is 2**.
