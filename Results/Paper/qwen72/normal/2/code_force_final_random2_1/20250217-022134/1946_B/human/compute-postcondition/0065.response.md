To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `range(k - 1)` generates at least one value. This means `k - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which implies `k` must be greater than 1.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).
- **`k`**: To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than 1.

### Other Variables:
- **`T`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`_`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`n`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`a`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`s`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`t`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`tmp`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`ans`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
The only adjustments needed are for `i` and `k` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0**.
