The code snippet `ans += t` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `t` to it. Let's break down the impact of this operation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
   - `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `t` is `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD`.
   - `i` is `k-2`.
   - `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `t` to it.
   - The new value of `ans` is `ans + t`.

3. **Output State**:
   - `T` remains an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` remains 2.
   - `n` and `k` remain the integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1.
   - `a` remains the list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
   - `s` remains the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `t` remains `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD`.
   - `i` remains `k-2`.
   - `ans` is now `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `_` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD`; `i` is `k-2`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t`.**
