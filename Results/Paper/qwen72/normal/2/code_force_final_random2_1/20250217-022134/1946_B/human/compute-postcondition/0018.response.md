The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third element in `a`.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the third element in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0**
