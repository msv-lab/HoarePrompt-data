Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.** 

Explanation: The variable `ans` is calculated using the formula `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, where `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, and `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`. The value of `MOD` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a constant used for modulo operations. All other variables remain unchanged.
