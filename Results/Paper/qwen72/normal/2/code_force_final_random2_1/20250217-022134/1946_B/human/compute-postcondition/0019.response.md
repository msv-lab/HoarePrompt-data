Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the third element in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `tmp` is updated to `tmp` + `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tmp` is incremented by the value of `x`, which is the third element in the list `a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
