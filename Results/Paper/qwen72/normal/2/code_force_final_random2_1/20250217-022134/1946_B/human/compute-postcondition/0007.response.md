To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`.

1. **`x`**: This variable is used to iterate over the elements of the list `a`. It will take on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration of the loop.
2. **`a`**: This is the list of integers that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is 0.
- `tmp` is 0.

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `x` will be set to the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `a` has at least one element and `x` is set to the first element of `a`.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `x` is the first element in `a`**
