### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - It calculates the sum of the array `a` and stores it in `s`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**:
   - It iterates through the array `a` to find the maximum subarray sum `t` that is non-negative. This is done using a variable `tmp` to keep track of the current subarray sum and updating `t` to the maximum value found.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation**:
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This ensures that the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Operations Loop**:
   - The program then performs `k-1` operations. In each operation, it doubles the value of `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step to prevent overflow.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the result `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**:
  - The program correctly identifies the maximum subarray sum that is non-negative. This is crucial because the problem requires selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array, and the maximum subarray sum will maximize the final sum of the array.

- **Correctness of Operations Loop**:
  - The loop correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for each operation and adds it to the answer `ans`. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to perform `k` operations, where each operation can potentially double the effect of the maximum subarray sum.

- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The program uses modulo `10^9 + 7` at appropriate places to ensure that the result does not overflow and remains within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output correctly, calculates the maximum subarray sum, and performs the operations as specified in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
