Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least two elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `max(tmp, 0)`, `i` is `k-1`, if `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `tmp` is `tmp + x`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tmp += x` updates the value of `tmp` by adding the value of `x` to it.
- `x` is the second element in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `tmp` is now `tmp + x`.
- The condition `if tmp < 0, tmp is set to 0` remains valid, meaning if the new `tmp` is less than 0, it will be set to 0. However, since we don't know the initial value of `tmp`, we only state that `tmp` is now `tmp + x`.
