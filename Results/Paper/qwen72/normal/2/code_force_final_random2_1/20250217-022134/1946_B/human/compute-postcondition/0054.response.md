The code snippet `tmp += x` updates the value of `tmp` by adding the value of `x` to it. Given the initial state:

- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0.
- `x` is the second element in `a`.
- `tmp` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0.

After executing `tmp += x`, the value of `tmp` becomes the sum of the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0, plus the second element in `a`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0, `x` is the second element in `a`, `tmp` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0 plus the second element in `a`.**
