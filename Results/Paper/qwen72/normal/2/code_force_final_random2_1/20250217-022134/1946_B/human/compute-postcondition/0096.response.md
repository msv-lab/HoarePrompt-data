Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least two elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `max(0, 0)`, `i` is `k-1`, if `0` < 0, `0` is set to 0, `ans` is `((s + 0) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (0 * (k-1)) % MOD`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is set to 0, which was previously unspecified.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `i`, `ans`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `if tmp < 0, tmp is set to 0` does not apply because `tmp` is already 0.
- The value of `t` is `max(0, 0)`, which is 0.
- The value of `ans` is calculated as `((s + 0) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (0 * (k-1)) % MOD`, simplifying to `s % MOD`.
- `x` remains the second element in the list `a`.
