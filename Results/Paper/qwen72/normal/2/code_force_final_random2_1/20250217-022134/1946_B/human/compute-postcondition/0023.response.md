Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, and `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.
- For each element `x`, `tmp` is incremented by `x`.
- If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
- `t` is updated to be the maximum of `tmp` and its current value.
- After the loop completes, `t` holds the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, and `tmp` is either the sum of the last non-negative contiguous subarray or 0 if it has become negative.
