Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(t * (2`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is `x`, `x` is the first element in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`.
- Initially, `tmp` is 0 and `x` is the first element in the list `a`.
- After executing the code, `tmp` is now equal to the value of `x`.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`) remain unchanged.
