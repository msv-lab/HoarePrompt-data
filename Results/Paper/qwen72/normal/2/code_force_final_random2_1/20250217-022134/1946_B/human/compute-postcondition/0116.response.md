To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD`.
- `i` is `k-2`.
- `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD`.

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `k - 1`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k-2`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` should be `k-1`.

### Final State:
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and are not modified by the loop itself.

### Conclusion:
State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `_` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD`; `i` is `k-1`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD`.**
