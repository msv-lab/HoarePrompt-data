Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `(t * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD`, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t * 2`.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `tmp`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`.
