Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains only negative numbers correctly. According to the problem description, if the array contains only negative numbers, the optimal strategy is to insert the sum of an empty subarray (which is 0) into the array during each operation. This is because adding the sum of any non-empty subarray would decrease the total sum of the array. However, the current implementation does not consider this scenario properly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```
The correct output should be `-6` (or `999999994` modulo \(10^9 + 7\)), because the best strategy is to insert the sum of an empty subarray (0) twice, which does not change the sum of the array. The program, however, might incorrectly calculate a different value because it does not handle the case where all elements are negative correctly.

To fix this, the program should check if the maximum subarray sum (`t`) is less than or equal to zero and handle this case appropriately.
