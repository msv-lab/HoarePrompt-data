Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(t * (2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = sum(a)` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `s`.
- The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t` remains in its original form as `(t * (2` since no assignment or calculation is performed on `t` in the given code snippet.
