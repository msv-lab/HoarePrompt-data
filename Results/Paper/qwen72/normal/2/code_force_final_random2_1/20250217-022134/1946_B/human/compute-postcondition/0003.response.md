The code reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `k` after converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state specifies that `T` is an integer read from the standard input and `_` is 0. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values from the input line, while `T` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input.**
