Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `x` is the second element in `a`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tmp` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `tmp` is `tmp + x`, where `x` is the second element in the list `a`.
