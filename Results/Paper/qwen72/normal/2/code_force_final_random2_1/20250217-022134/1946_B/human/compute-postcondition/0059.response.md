Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0, `x` is the third element in `a`, `tmp` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0 plus the second element in `a` (or 0 if this sum is less than 0), `t` is now the maximum of `tmp` and the original `t`, `tmp` is now `tmp` plus the third element in `a`.**
