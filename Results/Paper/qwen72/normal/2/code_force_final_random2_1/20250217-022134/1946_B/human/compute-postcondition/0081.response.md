Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, `i` is `k-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`T`**: Remains unchanged as it is read from the standard input and not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: These values are read from the standard input and not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list of integers read from the standard input remains unchanged.
- **`s`**: The sum of the elements in `a` remains unchanged.
- **`t`**: After `k-1` iterations, `t` is multiplied by 2 each time and then taken modulo `MOD`. Therefore, `t` becomes `(2^(k-1) * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD) % MOD`.
- **`tmp`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: Initially, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. In each iteration, `t` is added to `ans` and then taken modulo `MOD`. After `k-1` iterations, `ans` becomes `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`.
- **`i`**: After `k-1` iterations, `i` is `k-1`.
