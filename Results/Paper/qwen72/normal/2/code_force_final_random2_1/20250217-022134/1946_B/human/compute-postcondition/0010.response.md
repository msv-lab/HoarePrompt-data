Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `x` is the first element in `a`.** 

The variable `tmp` was set to 0, overriding its previous value which was the first element in `a` and was less than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
