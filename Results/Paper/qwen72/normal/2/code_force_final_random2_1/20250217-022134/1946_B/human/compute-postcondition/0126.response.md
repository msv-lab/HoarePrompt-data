Functionality: ** The function `func` reads from the standard input a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the sum of the elements in `a`, the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`, and the number of operations `k`. The result for each test case is printed to the standard output, and the function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
