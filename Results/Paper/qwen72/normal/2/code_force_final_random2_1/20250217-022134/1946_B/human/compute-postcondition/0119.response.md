The code snippet `ans += t` adds the value of `t` to `ans`. Given the initial state, let's break down the impact:

- `T` remains an integer read from the standard input, with the constraint 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 2.
- `n` and `k` remain integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1.
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
- `s` remains the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` remains `t % MOD`.
- `i` remains `k-1`.
- `ans` was initially `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD`.

After executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD + t`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `_` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `t % MOD`; `i` is `k-1`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD + t`.**
