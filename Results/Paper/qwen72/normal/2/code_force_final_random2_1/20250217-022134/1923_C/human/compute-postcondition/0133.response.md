Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of a specified subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads input values for the number of test cases, the length of the list, the list itself, and the queries. It maintains a cumulative sum list to efficiently compute subarray sums. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
