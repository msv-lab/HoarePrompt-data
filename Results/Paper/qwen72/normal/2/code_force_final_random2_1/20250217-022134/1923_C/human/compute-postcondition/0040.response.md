Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `l` is a list of integers derived from user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
- `x` is the last integer in the list `l`.
- `_` is a throwaway variable, typically used in loops or unpacking tuples where the value is not needed.
- `m` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
