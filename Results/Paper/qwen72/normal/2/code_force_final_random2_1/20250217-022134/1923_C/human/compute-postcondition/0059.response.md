To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l` before the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l`, but this increment happens outside the loop head and does not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `_` in the loop head.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `a`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than 0**.
