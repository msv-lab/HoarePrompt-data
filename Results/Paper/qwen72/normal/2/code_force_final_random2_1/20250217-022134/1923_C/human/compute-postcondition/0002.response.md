The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `l` is a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input provided by the user.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input.**
