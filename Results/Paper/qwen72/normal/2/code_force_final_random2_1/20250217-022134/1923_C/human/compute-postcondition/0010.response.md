The code `p.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is the sum of the first and second integers in the list `l`, and `p` initially contains only the first integer from `l`, after executing this code, `p` will contain two elements: the first integer from `l` and the sum of the first and second integers in `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing the first integer from `l` and the sum of the first and second integers in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of the first and second integers in the list `l`, `x` is the second integer in the list `l`.**
