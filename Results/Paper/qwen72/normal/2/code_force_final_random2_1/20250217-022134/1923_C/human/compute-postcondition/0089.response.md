Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers read from user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `_`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than the new value of `_` is still valid.
