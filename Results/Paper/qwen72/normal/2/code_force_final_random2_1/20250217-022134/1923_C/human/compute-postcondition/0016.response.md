The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `a` and `b`.

- `a` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `_`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that must have at least as many integers as the length of `l`, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
