Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that has been fully iterated over, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is the length of the list `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than the length of the list `l` and greater than 0. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`.***
