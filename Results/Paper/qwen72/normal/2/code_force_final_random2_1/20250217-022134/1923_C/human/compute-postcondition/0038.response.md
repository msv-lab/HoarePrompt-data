The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting the value at index `a - 2` from the list `p` from the current value of `s`. Let's break down the impact:

- `s` was initially equal to `p[b - 1]`.
- The new value of `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `_`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
