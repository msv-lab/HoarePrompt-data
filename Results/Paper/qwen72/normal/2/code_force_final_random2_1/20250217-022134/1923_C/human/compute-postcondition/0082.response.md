The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value at index `a - 2` of the list `p` from the current value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers read from user input
- `l` is a list of integers derived from user input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`
- `x` is the last integer in the list `l`
- `_` is incremented by 1 from its last value
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input
- `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`
- `s` is the value of `p[b - 1]`

After executing the code:
- `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `s` is now `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
