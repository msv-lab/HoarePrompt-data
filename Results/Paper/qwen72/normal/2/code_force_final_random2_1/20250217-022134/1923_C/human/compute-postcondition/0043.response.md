Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input. For each iteration, if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the condition is not met and 'NO' is printed.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the value of `m` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop has processed `m` pairs of integers (`a`, `b`) from user input, and for each pair, it has checked the specified condition and printed 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
