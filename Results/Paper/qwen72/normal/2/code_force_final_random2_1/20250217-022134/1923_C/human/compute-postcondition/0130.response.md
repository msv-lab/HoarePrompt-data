Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that has been fully iterated over, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is the length of the list `l` + `m` - 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than the length of the list `l` + `m` - 1 and greater than 0. For each iteration, if `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2` is less than 0, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**

Explanation:
- The variable `_` starts at the length of the list `l` minus 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After `m` iterations, `_` will be the length of the list `l` plus `m` minus 1.
- The variable `m` must be greater than the final value of `_` to ensure the loop can run `m` times.
- The variables `a` and `b` are read from user input during each iteration, and the logic inside the loop updates `s` based on these values.
- The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are checked in each iteration, but the overall state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`) remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
