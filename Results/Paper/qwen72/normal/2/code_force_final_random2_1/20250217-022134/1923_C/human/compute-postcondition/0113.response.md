Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that has been fully iterated over, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is the length of the list `l` minus 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than the length of the list `l` minus 1 and greater than 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`. If `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the value of `(b - a + 1)`, the condition holds. Otherwise, either `(b - a + 1)` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 * `(b - a + 1)`.***
