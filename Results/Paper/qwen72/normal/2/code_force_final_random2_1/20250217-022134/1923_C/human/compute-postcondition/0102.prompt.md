Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the first integer from `l`, `c` is now equal to the first integer in the list `l`, `x` is the first integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that must have at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the first integer from `l` and the sum of the first and second integers in `l`, `c` is the sum of the first and second integers in the list `l`, `x` is the second integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the first integer from `l`, the sum of the first and second integers in `l`, and the sum of the first, second, and third integers in `l`, `c` is the sum of the first, second, and third integers in the list `l`, `x` is the third integer in the list `l`, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
