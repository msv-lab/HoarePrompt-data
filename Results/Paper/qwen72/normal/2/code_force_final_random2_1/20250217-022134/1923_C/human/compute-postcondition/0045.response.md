The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0
- `l` is a list of integers derived from user input
- `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`
- `x` is the last integer in the list `l`
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `m` is 0
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input
- The total number of iterations (input by the user) must be greater than the new value of `_`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` are updated with the new values read from the user input.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and the total number of iterations (input by the user) must be greater than the new value of `_`.**
