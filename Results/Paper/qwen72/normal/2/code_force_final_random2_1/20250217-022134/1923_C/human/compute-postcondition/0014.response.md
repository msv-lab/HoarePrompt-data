Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that must have at least as many integers as the length of `l`, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n` and `m` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `l` must contain at least as many integers as its original length for the loop to complete all iterations.
- The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `p` will be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.
- The variable `c` will be equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
- The variable `x` will be the last integer in the list `l` after the loop completes.
