The code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means that `s` now holds the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` up to the index `b - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`.**
