To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` and `m`: Integers read from user input.
   - `l`: A list of integers derived from user input that has been fully iterated over.
   - `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c`: The sum of all integers in the list `l`.
   - `x`: The last integer in the list `l`.
   - `_`: The length of the list `l` + 1.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from user input.
   - `m`: Must be greater than the length of the list `l` + 1 and greater than 0.
   - `s`: Calculated based on the following conditions:
     - If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
     - If `a - 2` is less than 0, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because the conditions described do not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
