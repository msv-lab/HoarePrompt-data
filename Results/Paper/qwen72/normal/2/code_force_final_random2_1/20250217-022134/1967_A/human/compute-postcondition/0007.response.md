To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i`, `n`.

### Analysis:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, n - 1)`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than 0.
- Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments:
- The variable `i` will start at 0, as specified by the `range(0, n - 1)`.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `r` is the smallest element in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
