Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input split, `r` is now `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is `int(input())` (assuming `int(input())` is the next integer greater than the current `ii` for the loop to execute again). Additionally, the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` is true, meaning the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between the next element in the list `a` and the current element `a[i]` is greater than `k`.**
