Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `rem` is 0, `i` is 0. If \((i + 1) \times (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k\), then `k` is 0, `r` is `r + k`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (a[1] - a[0])`, `r` is `a[1]`, and `y` is 0.***
