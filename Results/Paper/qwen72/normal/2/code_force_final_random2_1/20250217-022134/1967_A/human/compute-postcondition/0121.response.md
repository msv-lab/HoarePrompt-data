Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `ii` is `int(input())`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[1] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[3]`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 2`.***
