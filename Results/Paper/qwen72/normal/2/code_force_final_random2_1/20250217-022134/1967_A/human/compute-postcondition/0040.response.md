Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[n-2] + k // (n-1)` if the condition `(n-2 + 1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) > k` was met at the last iteration, otherwise `r` is `a[n-1]`, `rem` is `k % (n-1)` if the condition was met, otherwise `rem` is 0, `y` is 1 if the condition was met, otherwise `y` is 0, and `k` is 0***.
