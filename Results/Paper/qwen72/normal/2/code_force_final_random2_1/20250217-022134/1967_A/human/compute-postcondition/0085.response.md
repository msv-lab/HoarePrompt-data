Postcondition: ***After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `r` is either `a[n-1] + k // n` if `k` is not 0, or the last value calculated based on the conditions within the loop if `k` is 0, `rem` is the remainder of the last division operation performed, `y` is the number of elements remaining in the list `a` after the loop has processed, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.***
