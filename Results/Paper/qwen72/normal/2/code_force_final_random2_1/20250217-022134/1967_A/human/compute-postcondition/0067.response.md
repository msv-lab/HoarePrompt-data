The code snippet updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `r` is the second element of the sorted list `a`
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input

Let's calculate the new value of `k`:

1. `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2.
2. `a[i + 1]` is `a[2]`, and `a[i]` is `a[1]`.
3. The difference `a[2] - a[1]` is calculated.
4. Multiply the result by 2 (since `i + 1` is 2).
5. Subtract this product from the current value of `k`.

Therefore, the new value of `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is the second element of the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.**
