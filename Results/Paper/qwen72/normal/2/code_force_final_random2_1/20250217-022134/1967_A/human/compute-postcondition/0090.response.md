Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `k` is the second integer from the input split, `r` is now `a[0]`, `rem` is the remainder of the last division operation performed, `y` is the number of elements remaining in the list `a` after the loop has processed, `ii` is `int(input())` (assuming `int(input())` is the next integer greater than the current `ii` for the loop to execute again).**
