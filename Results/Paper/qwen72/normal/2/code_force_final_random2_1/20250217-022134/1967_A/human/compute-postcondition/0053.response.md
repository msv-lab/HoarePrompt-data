Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`, `y` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, and the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is calculated as `k % (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, so `rem` is `k % 1`, which is always 0 because any number modulo 1 is 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
