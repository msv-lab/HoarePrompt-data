Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the first element of the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`, and `y` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (a[1] - r)`, `r` is the second element of the sorted list `a`, and `y` remains 0.***
