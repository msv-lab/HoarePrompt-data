Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the first element of the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the first element of the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`, and `y` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (a[1] - r)`, `r` is the second element of the sorted list `a`, and `y` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the second element of `a` plus `k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is the third element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `y` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
