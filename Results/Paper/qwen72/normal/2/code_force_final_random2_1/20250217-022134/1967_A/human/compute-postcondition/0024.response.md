The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `k -= (1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, which further simplifies to `k -= 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is decreased by 2 * (a[2] - a[1])**
