### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` (number of card types) and `k` (number of coins), followed by the list `a` of initial card counts.

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to distribute the coins efficiently by focusing on the smallest card counts first.

3. **Distributing Coins**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list `a` and attempts to distribute the coins to make the card counts more uniform.
   - If the required number of coins to equalize the current card count with the next higher card count exceeds the available coins `k`, it calculates the maximum possible card count `r` and the remainder `rem`.
   - If the coins are sufficient to equalize the current card count with the next higher card count, it updates `k` and continues to the next card count.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - If there are still coins left after the loop, it calculates the final card count `r` and prints the result.
   - If no coins are left, it calculates the final score considering the remainder `rem` and the number of card types that did not receive additional cards `y`.

5. **Output**: The function correctly prints the maximum score for each test case.

### Correctness:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the distribution of coins and calculates the maximum score for each test case as expected.

**Correctness: True**
