Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1.
- The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[1] + k // (i + 1)`.
  - Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2.
  - Therefore, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.
