The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer greater than 1, the value of `y` is `n - 3`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, and `rem`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`**
