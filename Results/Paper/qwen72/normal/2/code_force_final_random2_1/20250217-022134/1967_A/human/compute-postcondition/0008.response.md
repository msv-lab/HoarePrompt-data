Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `r` is the smallest element in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition \((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k\) is true.**
