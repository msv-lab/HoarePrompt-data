The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the character `'B'`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 32.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string `a`.
- `h` is the number of 'B's in the input string `a`.
- Each of the `t` test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all `t` strings are distinct.
- The number of 'A's (`l`) is less than or equal to the number of 'B's (`h`).

The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the character `'B'`.

Output: **B**
