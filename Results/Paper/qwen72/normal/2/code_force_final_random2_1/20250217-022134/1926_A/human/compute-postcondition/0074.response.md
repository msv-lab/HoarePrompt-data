The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given context, it implicitly works with a set of `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32. Each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all `t` strings are distinct. The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the content of these strings.
