The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 32`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The function counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. If the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed a result ('A' or 'B') for each test case. The final state of the program is that `t` results have been printed, one for each test case.
