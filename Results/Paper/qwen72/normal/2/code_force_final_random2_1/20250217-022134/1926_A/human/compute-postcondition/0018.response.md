Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, and `j` is the third character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', `l` is 3 and `h` is 1. If `j` is not 'A', `l` is 1 and `h` is 3. Each of the `t` test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all `t` strings are distinct.***
