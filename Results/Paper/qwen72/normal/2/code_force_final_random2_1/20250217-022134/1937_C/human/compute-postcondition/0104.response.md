Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the final user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.**

Explanation: The code snippet `g = 0` sets the variable `g` to 0. Since `g` was already 0 in the initial state, the value of `g` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
