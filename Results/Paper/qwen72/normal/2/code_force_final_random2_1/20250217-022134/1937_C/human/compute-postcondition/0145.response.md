Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set), `prev` is 2 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which is already part of the initial state.
- No other variables are affected by this code.
- The initial state conditions remain unchanged.
- The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r`, which is the new user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. If `r` is not '>', `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0. However, since the condition "if `r` is '>'" is repeated, the final value of `prev` is 2 if `r` is '>', and 0 otherwise.
