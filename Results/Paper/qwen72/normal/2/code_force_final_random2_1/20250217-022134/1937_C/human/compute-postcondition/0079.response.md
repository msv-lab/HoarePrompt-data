Output State: **`I` is defined, `R` is defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is 0, and if `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**
