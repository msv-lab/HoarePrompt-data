To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(n \neq 2\).
- `i` is 0.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- If `res` (the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`) is `<`, then `min_indices` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index, 0]`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

### Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
- The value of `n` must remain the same, as it is the upper bound of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be adjusted in the loop head is `i`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is 1; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0. If `res` (the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`) is `<`, then `min_indices` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index, 0]`.**
