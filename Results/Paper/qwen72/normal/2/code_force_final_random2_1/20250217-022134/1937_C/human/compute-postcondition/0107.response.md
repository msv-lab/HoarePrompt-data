Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the final user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v2 = i` updates the value of `v2` to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is initially 1, `v2` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
