The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer provided by the user with the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and `n` is not equal to 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 3 (because `n` cannot be 2), the loop will execute again if `i` is 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 2. If `res` (the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`) is `<`, then `max_index` is 1. Otherwise, `max_index` remains 0.**
