Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 0, `max_index` is 0, `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer provided by the user with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and `n` is not equal to 2.
- The variables `i` and `max_index` are both initialized to 0.
- The code snippet assigns the result of the function call `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` to the variable `res`.
- Since the function `func_1` is called with the arguments `0, max_index, 0, i`, and these arguments are all known (0, 0, 0, 0), the value of `res` is the result of this function call.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `max_index` remain unchanged.
- The output state includes the updated value of `res` and retains the initial conditions for `n`, `i`, and `max_index`.
