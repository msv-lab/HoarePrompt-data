Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `I` is defined and can be used to read a list of integers from input. `R` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input and returns it.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the final user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set), if `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the highest index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>' throughout the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
