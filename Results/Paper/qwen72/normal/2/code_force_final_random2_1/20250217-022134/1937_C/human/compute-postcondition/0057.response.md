Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is the next element in `min_indices`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`. If `res` (the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`) is equal to `=`, then `min_index` is updated to `i`. `res` is now the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `i` equals `max_index`, the loop continues to the next iteration.**
