To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute if the range from 0 to `n` (exclusive) contains at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints that `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and `n` is not equal to 2, we can infer that `n` is already greater than 0 and meets the condition for the loop to execute.

However, the state of `i` needs to be considered as it is part of the loop head. At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0, which is the first value in the range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 0, `max_index` is 0**
