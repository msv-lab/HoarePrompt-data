Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it determines the minimum index. Specifically, the logic for updating `min_indices` and selecting `min_index` is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Finding the Maximum Index (`max_index`)**:
   - The code correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)` for all `i`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Index (`min_index`)**:
   - The code attempts to find the minimum index by comparing `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])` with `(p_max_index | p_i)` for all `i`.
   - However, the logic for updating `min_indices` is incorrect. It appends all indices `i` where `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0]) >= (p_max_index | p_i)`, which includes both equal and greater values.
   - This results in `min_indices` containing indices that are not necessarily the minimum.

3. **Selecting the Final `min_index`**:
   - The final selection of `min_index` from `min_indices` is also flawed. It iterates through `min_indices` and updates `min_index` if the comparison `(p_min_index | p_min_index) == (p_min_index | p_i)` is true.
   - This logic does not ensure that `min_index` is the actual minimum index in the permutation.

To fix this, the logic for finding the minimum index should be revised to correctly identify the minimum element in the permutation. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print(f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return input().strip()

def func_2(a, b):
    print(f'! {a} {b}')
    sys.stdout.flush()

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        func_2(0, 1)
        return
    
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)
        if res == '<':
            max_index = i
    
    min_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == max_index:
            continue
        res = func_1(max_index, i, max_index, min_index)
        if res == '>':
            min_index = i
    
    func_2(max_index, min_index)

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

In this corrected version:
- We correctly update `max_index` by comparing `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)`.
- We then find `min_index` by comparing `(p_max_index | p_i)` with `(p_max_index | p_min_index)` and updating `min_index` if the former is greater.
- Finally, we output the pair `(max_index, min_index)`.

This ensures that the solution correctly identifies the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
