Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<' at any iteration, then `v1` is set to the value of `i` at that iteration; otherwise, `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n-1`, so `n` must be greater than or equal to its initial value for the loop to complete all iterations.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`.
- **`v1`**: `v1` starts at 0 and is updated to the value of `i` whenever `r` is '<'. If `r` is never '<', `v1` remains 0.
- **`v2`**: `v2` is updated to the current value of `i` in each iteration, so after the loop, `v2` will be `n-1`.
- **`r`**: `r` is the user input received during the last iteration.
- **`prev`**: `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- **Other Variables**: `I`, `R`, `kp`, and `g` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
