Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `I` is defined (but its value is not specified).
- `R` is defined (but its value is not specified).
- `kp` is 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the final user input.
- The output buffer has been flushed.
- `prev` is 0.
- If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `v1`:**
   - `v1` is defined as `n-1`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, `v1` will be a positive integer less than `n`.

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined but its value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` without additional information.

3. **Determine the value of `prev`:**
   - `prev` is explicitly set to 0.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev` substituted into the placeholders.

- `v1` will be `n-1`.
- `i` is an undefined variable, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `prev` is 0.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? n-1 i n-1 0 (where n-1 is the value of v1, i is the value of i, and 0 is the value of prev)**
