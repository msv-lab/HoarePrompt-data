Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `I` and `R` are defined (though their specific values are not provided).
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `r` is the new user input.
   - If the new `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i` and the current value of `r` remains '>'.
   - If the new `r` is not '>', the current value of `r` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is updated based on the value of `r`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is updated to `i`, which is 2.
     - If `r` is not '>', then `prev` remains undefined (or could be some other value, but we don't have that information).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is undefined or some other value, but we cannot determine it precisely without more information.

Given the information, the most precise description is to assume the worst-case scenario where `prev` is undefined or some other value, but since the problem does not specify otherwise, we will assume the most common case where `r` is '>', making `prev` equal to 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```python
? n-1 2 n-1 2
```

Output: **? n-1 2 n-1 2**
