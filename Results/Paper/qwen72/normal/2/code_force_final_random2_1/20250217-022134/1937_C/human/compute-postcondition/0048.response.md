To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(n \neq 2\).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- `min_indices` must contain at least one element.
- `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.
- If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the current iteration of the loop ends and the next iteration begins, but the values of `n`, `i`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` remain unchanged.
- If `res` is equal to `=`, then `min_index` is updated to `i` and `res` remains `=`.
- If `res` is not equal to `=`, then the values of `n`, `i`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in min_indices:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is iterated over the elements of `min_indices`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(n \neq 2\).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
   - `min_indices` must contain at least one element.
   - `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is iterated over `min_indices`, the value of `i` will change to the next element in `min_indices` for the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`n`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will take the value of the next element in `min_indices`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is the next element in `min_indices`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.**
