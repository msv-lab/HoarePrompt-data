Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is `n-1`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` is a list containing the indices where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` during the loop's execution. If no such indices exist, `min_indices` contains the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`).**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the input provided by the user.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- The variable `max_index` remains the same as it is determined before the loop starts and is not modified within the loop.
- The list `min_indices` will contain the indices where the function `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` during the loop's execution. If no such indices exist, `min_indices` will contain the last value of `i`, which is `n-1`.
