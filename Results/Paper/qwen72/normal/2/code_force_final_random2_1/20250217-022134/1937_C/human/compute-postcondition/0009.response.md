Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 0, `max_index` is 0, `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` and the value of `res` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code `max_index = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `max_index`. Since `i` was already 0, the value of `max_index` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
