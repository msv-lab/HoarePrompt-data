### Reasoning:

1. **Base Case Handling (n = 2):**
   - The function correctly handles the base case when `n` is 2. It directly prints `! 0 1`, which is the correct answer since the maximum XOR value for any permutation of `[0, 1]` is `1`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index:**
   - The function initializes `max_index` to 0 and iterates through all indices from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it compares `p_0 | p_max_index` with `p_0 | p_i` using the query `? 0 max_index 0 i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to `i`. This ensures that `max_index` holds the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation after the loop.
   - This part of the logic is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Indices:**
   - After finding the `max_index`, the function initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
   - It then iterates through all indices again, comparing `p_max_index | p_min_indices[0]` with `p_max_index | p_i` using the query `? max_index min_indices[0] max_index i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`. Otherwise, it appends `i` to `min_indices`. This ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices that have the same minimum value when ORed with `max_index`.
   - This part of the logic is also correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

4. **Finding the Minimum Index:**
   - The function initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
   - It then iterates through `min_indices` to find the actual minimum index by comparing `p_min_index | p_min_index` with `p_min_index | p_i` using the query `? min_index min_index min_index i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it updates `min_index` to `i`. This ensures that `min_index` holds the index of the element with the lowest value in the permutation.
   - This part of the logic is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The function prints the indices `max_index` and `min_index` using `! max_index min_index`.
   - This part of the logic is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries (at most 3n) to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized. The logic for finding the maximum and minimum indices is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints.

**Final: **True**
