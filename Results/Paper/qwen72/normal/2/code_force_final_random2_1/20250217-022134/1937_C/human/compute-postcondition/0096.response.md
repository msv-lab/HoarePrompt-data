Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `I` and `R` are defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the new user input.
- All other variables (`n`, `I`, `R`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition about updating `prev` and the value of `r` if the new `r` is '>' does not apply here because the code snippet only updates `r` with the new user input. The conditions for updating `prev` and `r` are not executed in this snippet.
