Output State: **`I` is defined, `R` is defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new user input, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**
