To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_index` is 0.
- `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`.
- If `res` is `<`, then the value of `res` is `<`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration (which is the initial state before the first iteration), `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
4. **Other Variables**: The variables `max_index`, `res`, and `n` are not modified by the loop head itself. They remain unchanged.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `max_index` remains 0.
- `res` remains the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` from the previous iteration, which is `<`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 1, `max_index` is 0, `res` is `<`.**
