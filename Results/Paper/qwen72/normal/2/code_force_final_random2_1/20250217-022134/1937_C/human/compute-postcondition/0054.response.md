To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(n \neq 2\).
- `i` is the next element in `min_indices`.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- `min_indices` must contain at least one element.
- `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.
- If `res` (the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`) is equal to `=`, then `min_index` is updated to `i`.
- If `i` equals `max_index`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for i in min_indices:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `min_indices`.
- The state of `i` changes with each iteration, taking the next value from `min_indices`.
- The state of `min_indices` itself does not change within the loop head, but it must contain at least one element for the loop to start and continue.
- The state of `min_index` can change within the loop body based on the condition involving `res`.

### Adjusting States:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next element in `min_indices`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `min_indices`. Since `min_indices` must contain at least one element, the loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `min_indices`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is the next element in `min_indices`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`. If `res` (the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`) is equal to `=`, then `min_index` is updated to `i`. If `i` equals `max_index`, the loop continues to the next iteration.**
