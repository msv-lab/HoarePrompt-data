Postcondition: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is 0; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index]`; `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and `res` is not equal to `<`.**
