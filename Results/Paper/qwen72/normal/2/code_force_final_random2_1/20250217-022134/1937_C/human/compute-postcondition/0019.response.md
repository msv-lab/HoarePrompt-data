Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is `n-1`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the last value in the range, which is `n-1`. The variable `max_index` will hold the largest index `i` for which the function `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned `<`. If no such index exists, `max_index` will remain 0. All other conditions and variables that were part of the initial state but not modified by the loop remain unchanged.
