Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 1; `max_index` is 1; `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_index` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
