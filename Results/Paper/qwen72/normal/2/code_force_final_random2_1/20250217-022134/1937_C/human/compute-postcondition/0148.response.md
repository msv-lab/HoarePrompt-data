Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set). If `r` is '>', `prev` is 3. Otherwise, `prev` is 2 if `r` is '>', 1 if `r` is '<', and 0 otherwise.***
