Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `I` and `R` are defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, if the new `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i` and the current value of `r` remains '>', if the new `r` is not '>', the current value of `r` remains unchanged, `i` is 2.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which was already mentioned as being flushed in the initial state. Therefore, no changes occur to the variables or the state of the program. All initial conditions remain valid.
