Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is 0, and `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which means any pending output is written to the terminal or file immediately. However, this does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the program remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the output buffer has been flushed.
