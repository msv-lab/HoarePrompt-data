Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, and `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set). Otherwise, `prev` remains 0, and `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).***
