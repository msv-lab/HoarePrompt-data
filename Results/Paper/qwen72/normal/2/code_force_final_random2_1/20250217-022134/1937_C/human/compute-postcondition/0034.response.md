To solve this, let's break down the given code and its impact on the initial state:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 < n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
  - `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`.
  - `min_indices` is a list containing `[1]` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `[0, 1]`. If `res` is not `<`, then `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index, 0]` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `[max_index, 0, 1]`.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)
  ```

- **Impact of the Code**:
  - The variable `res` is updated to the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`.
  - The values of `n`, `i`, `max_index`, and `min_indices` remain unchanged.

- **Calculating the Result**:
  - `res` is now the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`.
  - The value of `min_indices[0]` depends on the previous value of `res`:
    - If the previous `res` was `<`, then `min_indices[0]` is `1`.
    - If the previous `res` was not `<`, then `min_indices[0]` is `max_index`.

- **Output State**:
  - `n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 < n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
  - `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`.
  - `min_indices` is a list containing `[1]` if the previous `res` is `<`, otherwise `[0, 1]`. If the previous `res` is not `<`, then `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index, 0]` if the previous `res` is `<`, otherwise `[max_index, 0, 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 < n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is 2; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`. `min_indices` is a list containing `[1]` if the previous `res` is `<`, otherwise `[0, 1]`. If the previous `res` is not `<`, then `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index, 0]` if the previous `res` is `<`, otherwise `[max_index, 0, 1]`.**
