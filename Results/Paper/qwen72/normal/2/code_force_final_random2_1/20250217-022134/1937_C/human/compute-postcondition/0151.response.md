The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the terminal or file. This operation does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state beyond ensuring that any buffered output is immediately displayed.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to its initial value
- `i` is `n-1`
- `I` is defined
- `R` is defined
- `kp` is 2
- `g` is 0
- `v2` is `n-1`
- The output buffer has been flushed
- `r` is the new user input
- `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set)
- If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the highest index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>' throughout the loop

The only effect of the code is to ensure that the output buffer is flushed, which is already part of the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set), if `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the highest index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>' throughout the loop.**
