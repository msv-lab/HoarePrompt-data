Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the integer `u`.** 

The integer `u` has been appended to the deque `tree`, which now contains the element `u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
