Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input. If `empty` is True, `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]`, and `empty` is False. If `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque, and `empty` remains False. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `u` at the leftmost position. If `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains the integer `u`. If `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[v]` and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. Additionally, if `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`. If `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `u` is equal to `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque. If `empty` is True, `tree` contains the integers `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False, and if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `u` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, and if `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains the integer `v`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque. If `empty` is True, `tree` contains the integers `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False: if `v` equals the first element in `tree`, then `u` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `v` does not equal the first element in `tree`: if `v` equals the last element in `tree`, `tree` contains `v`; if `u` equals the first element in `tree`, `v` is appended to the left of `tree`; if `u` equals the last element in `tree`, `tree` contains `v`; otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
