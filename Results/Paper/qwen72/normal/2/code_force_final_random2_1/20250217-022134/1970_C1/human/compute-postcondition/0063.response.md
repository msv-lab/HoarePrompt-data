The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `edges`, and `u_1`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. `edges` is a list of tuples, each tuple representing an edge connecting two nodes `u` and `v` where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the initial position of the stone.

The function returns the minimum number of moves required to move the stone from its initial position `u_1` to one of the two leaves of the tree.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `edges`, and `u_1`. It returns the minimum number of moves required to move the stone from its initial position `u_1` to one of the two leaves of the tree.**
