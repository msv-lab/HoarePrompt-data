Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque. If `u` equals the last element in `tree`, then `tree` contains `v`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.***
