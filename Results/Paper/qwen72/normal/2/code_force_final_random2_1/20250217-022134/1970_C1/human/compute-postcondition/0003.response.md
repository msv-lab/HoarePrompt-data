To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `t` is an input integer (not used in the loop head)
- `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n (not used in the loop head)
- `tree` is an empty deque (not used in the loop head)
- `empty` is True (not used in the loop head)

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
- The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to `n - 2`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `n` is already given as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `n - 1` will always be greater than 0, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.
- The variable `i` should start at 0.

### Final State:
The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `i` starts at 0, which is already implied by the `range(n - 1)` function. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed beyond the initial state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0**
