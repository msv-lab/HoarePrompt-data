The code snippet `n, t = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. 

- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `t` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `u_1` is the initial position of the stone where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. After executing the code, `n` and `t` are updated with the input values, and `u_1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**
