Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer `v` to the deque `tree`. Initially, `tree` contained only the integer `u`. After the execution, `tree` now contains both `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
