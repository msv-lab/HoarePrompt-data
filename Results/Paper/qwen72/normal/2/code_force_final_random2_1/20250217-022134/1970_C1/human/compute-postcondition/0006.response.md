Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing `[u]`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `u` is appended to the deque `tree`.
- Since `tree` now contains at least one element (`u`), the variable `empty` is no longer True and is updated to False.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u_1`, `i`, `u`, and `v`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
