Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `t`, `u_1`, `i`, `empty`, and `tree` remain unchanged.
- The variables `u` and `v` are assigned the values from the user input, which are integers.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
