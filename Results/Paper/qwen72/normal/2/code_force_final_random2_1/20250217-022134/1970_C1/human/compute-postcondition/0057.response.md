The code snippet calculates the minimum distance from the start position (`start`) to the beginning and end of the tree's longest path, using the given `t` (time) and `idx` (index of `start` in `tree`). It stores these distances in a list called `moves`.

- `min(t, idx)` computes the minimum of `t` and the index `idx` of `start` in `tree`.
- `min(t, n - idx - 1)` computes the minimum of `t` and the distance from `start` to the end of the tree, which is `n - idx - 1`.

These two values are stored in the list `moves`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is `n-2`, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers representing the nodes of a tree structure, with the first and last elements being the endpoints of the longest path in the tree, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`.**
