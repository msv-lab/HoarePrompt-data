Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that has been modified such that no character in `a` is less than the corresponding character in `b` (if `f` was set to 1 during the loop), or `a` and `b` remain unchanged if no such condition was met. `b` is a list of characters from the new input string that may have been swapped with characters in `a`. `f` is 1 if any character in `a` was found to be less than the corresponding character in `b` and a swap occurred, otherwise `f` remains 0. The loop iterates through all characters in `a` and `b` up to the length of `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of characters

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `a` is a list of characters with at least 1 element remaining

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `a` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements remaining




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
