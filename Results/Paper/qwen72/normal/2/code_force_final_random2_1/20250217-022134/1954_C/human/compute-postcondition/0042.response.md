Initial State: `i` is 2, `a` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements remaining.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The variable `i` is set to 2.
2. The variable `a` is a list of characters, and it is guaranteed to have at least 2 elements remaining after the current index `i`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

- `a[i]` accesses the element at index 2 of the list `a`.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline character is added after the printed element, meaning the output will be on the same line.

Since the exact characters in the list `a` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the character at index 2 of the list `a`)**
