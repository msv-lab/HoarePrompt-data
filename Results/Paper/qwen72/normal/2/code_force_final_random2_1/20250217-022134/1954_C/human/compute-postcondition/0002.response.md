Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, `a` is a list of characters from the input string, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 0.** 

The variable `f` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial values and conditions.
