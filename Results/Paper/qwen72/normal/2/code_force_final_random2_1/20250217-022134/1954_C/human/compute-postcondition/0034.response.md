Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, and `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is greater than `b[2]`, the third characters of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `f` remains unchanged.***
