Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a list of characters with at least 1 element remaining.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is 1.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` contains at least one character. Since `i` is 1, the list must have at least two elements to avoid an index out of range error.
3. **Accessing `a[i]`**: The expression `a[i]` accesses the element at index 1 of the list `a`. This means it will print the second element of the list `a`.
4. **`end=''`**: The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline is added after the printed character, so the output will remain on the same line.

### Final Output:
The code will print the second element of the list `a` without adding a newline.

Output: **[second element of the list `a`]**
