To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the number of elements in the list `T`.
- `i` starts at 1 and increments up to `n-1`.
- `a` is a list that initially contains some elements.
- `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line`.
- `t` and `line` remain unchanged.

### Transformations:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the element `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` is appended to the list `a`.
   - This means that after the loop, `a` will have `n-1` additional elements, each being the result of the subtraction `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

2. **Reversing the List**:
   - After the loop, the list `a` is reversed. This means the order of the elements in `a` is reversed.

3. **Creating the Result String**:
   - The variable `result` is a string containing the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces.

### Final State:
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` will be equal to `n-1`.
- `a` will have `n-1` additional elements appended to it, each element being the result of the subtraction `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` for each iteration `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- The list `a` is now reversed.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces.
- `t` and `line` remain unchanged.
- `T` remains the original list of integers derived from the input string `line`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the initial values are:
- `a = [10, 20]`
- `T = [5, 15, 25]`
- `n = 3`

#### Loop Execution:
- For `i = 1`: `a.append(a[0] - T[0])` → `a.append(10 - 5)` → `a = [10, 20, 5]`
- For `i = 2`: `a.append(a[1] - T[1])` → `a.append(20 - 15)` → `a = [10, 20, 5, 5]`

#### Reversing the List:
- `a` is reversed → `a = [5, 5, 20, 10]`

#### Creating the Result String:
- `result = "5 5 20 10"`

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which contains the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces.

Output: **5 5 20 10** (where the elements are the results of the subtractions and the list is reversed)
