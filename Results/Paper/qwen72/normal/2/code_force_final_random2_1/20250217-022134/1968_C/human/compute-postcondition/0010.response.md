Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` has two additional elements: `a[0] - T[0]` and `a[1] - T[1]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`, which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means the new element appended is `a[1] - T[1]`. Since `a` already had one additional element (`a[0] - T[0]`), now it has two additional elements. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
