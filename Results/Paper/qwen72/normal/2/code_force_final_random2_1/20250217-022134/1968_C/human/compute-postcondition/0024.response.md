The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as the difference between the element at index `i-1` in list `a` and the element at index `i-1` in list `T`. Given that `i` is 1, the code effectively appends the result of `a[0] - T[0]` to the list `a`.

Since `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `a`, which now includes an additional element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` has an additional element equal to `a[0] - T[0]`.**
