The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` converts the input string `line` into a list of integers, splitting the string by whitespace and converting each part to an integer. This operation updates the variable `T` with the resulting list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is `n-1`
- `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `line` is an input string

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is `n-1`
- `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `line` is an input string
- `T` is a list of integers derived from `line`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers derived from `line`.**
