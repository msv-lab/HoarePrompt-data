Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, and `a` has `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n-1`.
- The list `a` will have grown to contain `n` elements. The first element of `a` is still 1000, and each subsequent element `a[j]` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n-1`) is computed as the previous element `a[j-1]` minus the corresponding element `T[j-1]` from the list `T`.
