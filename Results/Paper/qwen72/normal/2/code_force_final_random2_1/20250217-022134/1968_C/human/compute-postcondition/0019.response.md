The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `result`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`.**
