Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `a` will have `n-1` additional elements appended to it, each element being the result of the subtraction `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` for each iteration `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variables `result`, `t`, and `line` remain unchanged, and `T` remains the original list of integers derived from the input string `line`.**
