To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` is `[1000]`.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
- `t` is a truthy value decreased by 1.
- `line` is the new input string.
- `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` will be set by the loop, starting from 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**.
