Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` contains `n` elements where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, but now `a` is reversed, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `line` is the new input string, and the other variables (`T`) remain unchanged.**
