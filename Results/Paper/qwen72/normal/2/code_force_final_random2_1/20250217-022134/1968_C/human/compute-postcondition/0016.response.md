To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` elements in reverse order.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `i` is one less than `n`, but it is not directly used in the `print(result)` statement.
   - `a` is a list of `n` elements in reverse order. For example, if `n` is 5 and the original list was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `a` would be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
   - `result` is a string that concatenates the elements of `a` with spaces between them. For example, if `a` is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, then `result` would be `"5 4 3 2 1"`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`.

Given this understanding, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the elements of the list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Output: **"a[0] a[1] ... a[n-1]" (where a is the list of n elements in reverse order)**

For example, if `n` is 5 and the original list was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output would be:

Output: **"5 4 3 2 1"**
