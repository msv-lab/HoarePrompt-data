To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` elements.
   - Each element from index 1 to `n-1` in `a` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
   - `a` is then reversed.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
   - Other variables (`t`, `line`, `T`) remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Calculation:**
   - The list `a` is initially filled with some values.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the value of `a[i]` is updated to `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
   - After the loop, the list `a` is reversed.
   - The `result` string is created by joining the elements of the reversed `a` with spaces.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `a` is reversed, the elements of `a` will appear in reverse order in the `result` string.
   - The `result` string will contain the elements of the reversed `a` separated by spaces.

Given this information, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the elements of the reversed `a` list, separated by spaces.

Output: **elements of the reversed `a` list separated by spaces**. 

For example, if `a` was originally `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]` after the loop and reversing, the output would be:
Output: **2 4 6 8 10**.
