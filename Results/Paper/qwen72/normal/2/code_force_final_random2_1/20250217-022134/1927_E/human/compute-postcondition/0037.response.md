The code snippet updates the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to `i`. Given that `i` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except for the elements at indices 1, k+1, 2*k+1, ..., (m-1)*k+1, which are set to m+1, m+2, m+3, ..., n-m; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1 - m`; `i` is 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.**
