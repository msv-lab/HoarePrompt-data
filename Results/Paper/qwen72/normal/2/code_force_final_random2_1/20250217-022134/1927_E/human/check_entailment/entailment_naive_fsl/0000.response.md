Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program constructs a k-level permutation of length n as required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases using `func_2()`, which calls `func_1()` for each test case. This matches the problem description's requirement for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes a permutation array of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the permutation array by placing values in positions that ensure the k-level condition is met. Specifically, it places values in positions that are multiples of `k` plus an offset `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`).
   - This approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, as required by the problem description.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is printed in the required format for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible values for `n` and `k` (e.g., `n=2`, `k=2`) correctly.
   - It also handles larger values within the constraints (e.g., `n=200000`, `k=200000`).

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
