You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the final state is as follows: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `j` is set to the value `j // k + 1` if `j % k == 0`, otherwise it is set to the value `(j // k) * k + (j % k) + 1`. The variable `curr_v` is `n + 1`, `i` is `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k * (n // k) + k - 1`. The variables `idx` and `idx_v` remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: [elements of permutation separated by spaces]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers, with the constraints that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
