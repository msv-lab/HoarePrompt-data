Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is m + 1; `i` is 0; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is m * k.** 

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `permutation` list will have values 1 through m placed at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k, where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k is less than n. All other elements in the `permutation` list will remain as zeros. The variable `curr_v` will be m + 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be m * k. The values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
