The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and it must still be less than `k`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except for the elements at indices 1, k+1, 2*k+1, ..., (m-1)*k+1, which are set to m+1, m+2, m+3, ..., n-m; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1 - m`; `i` is 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `m*k + 1`.**
