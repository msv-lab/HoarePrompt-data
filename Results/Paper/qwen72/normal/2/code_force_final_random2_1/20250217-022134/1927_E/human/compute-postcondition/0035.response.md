Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except for the elements at indices 1, k+1, 2*k+1, ..., (m-1)*k+1, which are set to m+1, m+2, m+3, ..., n-m; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1 - m`; `i` is 1; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `m*k + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to run as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.
- In each iteration, the value of `curr_v` is assigned to the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list.
- After each assignment, `curr_v` is incremented by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`.
- The loop will stop when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds the length of the `permutation` list.
- By the end of the loop, the elements at indices 1, k+1, 2*k+1, ..., (m-1)*k+1 in the `permutation` list will be filled with the values m+1, m+2, m+3, ..., n-m, respectively.
- The final value of `curr_v` will be `n + 1 - m`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `m*k + 1`.
