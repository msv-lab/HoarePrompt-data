### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate a permutation of length `n` that is `k-level`, meaning the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any contiguous subarray of length `k` should be at most 1.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with values `n` and `k`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - **Permutation Initialization**: It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - **Filling the Permutation**:
     - The outer loop runs `k` times, and the inner loop fills the permutation at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
     - The variable `curr_v` keeps track of the current value to be placed in the permutation, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each placement.
   - **Output**: The function prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: It calls `func_1` for each test case, decrementing `t` each time until all test cases are processed.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Permutation Construction**: The permutation is constructed by placing values in a way that ensures the sums of contiguous subarrays of length `k` are balanced. The approach of filling the permutation at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i` ensures that the values are distributed evenly.
   - **Sum Balance**: By distributing the values in this manner, the sums of the contiguous subarrays of length `k` will have minimal differences, satisfying the `k-level` condition.
   - **Edge Cases**: The code handles the constraints correctly, including the case where `k` is even and `k <= n`.

5. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the permutation is filled in a way that ensures the sums of contiguous subarrays of length `k` are balanced.
   - The final state of the permutation after the loops is consistent with the requirements of the problem.

Given the above reasoning and the verification of the annotated code, the program correctly generates a `k-level` permutation for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
