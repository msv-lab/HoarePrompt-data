### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Conditions:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` representing Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y % 2 != 0`. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the pattern of settling requires `y` to be even for any valid `k`.

3. **Function Call and List Construction:**
   - If `y` is even, the program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to get a list of potential `k` values.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and, if true, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to extend the list of potential `k` values.
   - The combined list `L1` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then printed as the length of the set.

4. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` initializes an empty list `M` and calculates the integer square root `w` of `q`.
   - It iterates through all integers `i` from 1 to `w-1` and checks if `i` is a divisor of `q` and if `i >= x - 1`. If both conditions are met, `i` is added to `M`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the quotient `q // i` is a divisor of `q` and if `q // i >= x - 1`. If both conditions are met, `q // i` is added to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the potential `k` values by considering the periodic nature of the settling pattern.
   - The use of the square root and divisors ensures that all possible `k` values are considered efficiently.
   - The final step of removing duplicates and counting the unique values is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
