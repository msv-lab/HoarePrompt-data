Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` where 1 < n <= 10^9. It computes the prime factorization of `n` and returns a generator that yields the prime factors. The prime factors are returned in the order they are generated, and each factor is yielded only once, regardless of its multiplicity in the factorization. After the function concludes, the input `n` remains unchanged, and the generator can be iterated over to retrieve the prime factors. **
