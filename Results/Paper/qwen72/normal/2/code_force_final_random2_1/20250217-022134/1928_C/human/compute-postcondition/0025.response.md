Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, and `w` must be at least 2. If `i >= x - 1`, then `M` includes the integers 2 and 3. Additionally, if `q % 2 == 0` and `q // 2 >= x - 1`, `M` also includes the integer `q // 2`. Otherwise, `M` includes only the integers 2 and 3. `i` is 3.***
