Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\)) and returns a list `M` containing integers that are divisors of `q` and meet certain conditions. Specifically, `M` includes any integer `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `q` (denoted as `w`) that is a divisor of `q` and satisfies `i >= x - 1`, as well as the corresponding quotient `q // i` if it also satisfies `q // i >= x - 1`. If `w` itself is an integer and `w >= x - 1`, it is also included in `M`. The function ensures that the returned list `M` contains only valid divisors and their corresponding quotients that meet the specified criteria. **
