To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
- `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, and `w` must be at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If `q` is divisible by `1`, and `q // 1` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` now includes the integers `1` and `q // 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```
while i < w:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `i < w`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `w`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` is already 2, and it is part of the loop head.
- The variable `w` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is 2 and the loop condition is `i < w`, `w` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to `i`, but `w` must be greater than 2.

State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing integers `w` if `w` is an integer and `w \geq x - 1`, `w` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, and `w` must be greater than 2**.
