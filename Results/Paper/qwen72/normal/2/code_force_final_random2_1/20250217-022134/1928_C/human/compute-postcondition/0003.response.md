Output State: **q and x are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < q â‰¤ 10^9, M is a list containing the integer w, w is the square root of q, and w is an integer (i.e., w == w // 1) and w is greater than or equal to x - 1.** 

The code appends the integer value of `w` to the list `M`. The initial conditions for `q`, `x`, and `w` remain unchanged, and `M` now contains the single element `w`.
