You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations, `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of the initial `nn` such that `nn % i != 0` plus 1. The dictionary `factors` will contain the prime factorization of the initial `n`, with each key being a prime factor and its value being the exponent in the factorization. The variable `nn` will be reduced to 1 if it was completely divisible by the prime factors found during the loop, or it will be the remaining part of the initial `n` that is not divisible by any smaller integers.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: *After all iterations, `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of the initial `nn` such that `nn % i != 0` plus 1. The dictionary `factors` will contain the prime factorization of the initial `n`, with each key being a prime factor and its value being the exponent in the factorization. The variable `nn` will be reduced to 1 if it was completely divisible by the prime factors found during the loop, or it will be the remaining part of the initial `n` that is not divisible by any smaller integers. If `nn` is greater than 1, `factors[nn]` is incremented by 1.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: `generate(0)` has yielded all its values and is now terminated, `factor` is the last yielded value, and no further values will be yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` where 1 < n <= 10^9 and returns a result based on the value of `n`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
