Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < len(primes)`, `rest` is the value returned by `generate(k + 1)` and must contain at least one element, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime * prime`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to `prime * prime * prime` because the original value of `prime_to_i` was `prime * prime`, and the code multiplies it by `prime` again.
- All other variables (`k`, `rest`, `prime`, `factor`, `factors[prime]`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, which is consistent with the initial state.
