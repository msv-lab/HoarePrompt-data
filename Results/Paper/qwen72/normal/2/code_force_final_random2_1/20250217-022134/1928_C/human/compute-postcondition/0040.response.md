Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < len(primes)`, `rest` is the value returned by `generate(k + 1)` and must contain at least one element, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the values `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration have been yielded.**

### Explanation:
- **`k`**: Remains a non-negative integer within the bounds of the length of the `primes` list.
- **`rest`**: Continues to be the value returned by `generate(k + 1)` and must contain at least one element.
- **`prime`**: Remains the same as `primes[k]`.
- **`prime_to_i`**: After all iterations, `prime_to_i` will be `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`. This is because `prime_to_i` is multiplied by `prime` in each iteration, and the loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times.
- **`factor`**: Remains the next element in `rest`.
- **`factors[prime]`**: Must be at least 0, as it determines the number of iterations.
- **Yielded Values**: The loop yields `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration, where `prime_to_i` starts at 1 and is multiplied by `prime` in each iteration. Thus, the values yielded are `factor * prime^0`, `factor * prime^1`, `factor * prime^2`, ..., `factor * prime^(factors[prime])`.
