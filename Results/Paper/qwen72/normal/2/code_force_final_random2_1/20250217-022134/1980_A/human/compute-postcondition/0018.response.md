Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user input, `s` is a string input by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, and `i` is 'F'. The value of `ans` is `m` multiplied by the number of characters in 'ABCDEF' that are not present in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `p` which is 'ABCDEF'.
- For each character `i` in `p`, if `i` is not in the `hmp` (which counts the occurrences of each character in `s`), `ans` is incremented by `m`.
- After the loop completes, `ans` will be `m` multiplied by the number of characters in 'ABCDEF' that do not appear in `s`.
- The variable `i` will be 'F' after the loop has completed its last iteration.
