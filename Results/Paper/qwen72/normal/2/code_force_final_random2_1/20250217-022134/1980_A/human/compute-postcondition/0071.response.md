The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. According to the initial state, `ans` is only incremented by `m` if `i` is not in `hmp`. Since `i` is 'B' and there is no information about `hmp` containing 'B', we assume `i` is not in `hmp`. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `m`.

Output State: **`p` is 'ABCDEF', `i` is 'B', `ans` is incremented by `m`.**
