Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `p` is the string `'ABCDEF'`.
- `i` is the last key in the dictionary `hmp`.
- `hmp` has no keys remaining to be processed.
- For each key `i` in `hmp`, if `hmp[i]` was less than `m`, `ans` was increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remained unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Dictionary `hmp`**: The dictionary `hmp` has been fully processed, meaning all keys have been iterated over, and there are no keys left to process.
2. **Variable `ans`**: The variable `ans` has been updated during the processing of the dictionary `hmp`. Specifically, for each key `i` in `hmp`, if the value `hmp[i]` was less than `m`, `ans` was incremented by `m - hmp[i]`. If `hmp[i]` was greater than or equal to `m`, `ans` remained unchanged.
3. **Final Value of `ans`**: Since the dictionary `hmp` has been fully processed, the value of `ans` is the result of all the updates that occurred during the iteration over the keys of `hmp`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Determining the Output:
- The `print(ans)` statement will output the final value of `ans` after all the updates have been applied.
- Since the exact values of `hmp` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the initial state, we know that `ans` has been updated according to the rules described.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the final value after processing all keys in the dictionary hmp)**
