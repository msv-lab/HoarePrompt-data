Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit calculated during the loop, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

The code snippet `remaining_items = []` reassigns the variable `remaining_items` to an empty list, which was already an empty list in the initial state. Therefore, the state of `remaining_items` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
