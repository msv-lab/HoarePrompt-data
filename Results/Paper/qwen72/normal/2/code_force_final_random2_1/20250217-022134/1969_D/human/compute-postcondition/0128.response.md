Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the entire process.** 

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `combined` list is empty because all elements have been processed. The `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were popped from `combined`, and `current_profit` reflects the final profit after all adjustments based on the conditions in the loop. The `max_profit` is the highest value of `current_profit` that was observed during the entire loop execution. All other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
