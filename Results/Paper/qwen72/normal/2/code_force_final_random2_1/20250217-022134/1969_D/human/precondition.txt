t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. cases is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of items, an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of items Bob can take for free, a list of integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the prices for Alice, and a list of integers b (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) representing the prices for Bob. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
