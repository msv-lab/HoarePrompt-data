The code snippet `prices = list(func_2())` updates the `prices` variable by assigning it the list returned by the function `func_2()`. This means that `prices` now contains the values returned by `func_2()`, which could be any list of values depending on the implementation of `func_2()`.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the entire process.**
