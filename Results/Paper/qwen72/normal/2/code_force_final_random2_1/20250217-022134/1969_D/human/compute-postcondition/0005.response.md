The code `prices = list(func_2())` assigns the result of calling `func_2()` to the variable `prices` as a list. Since `n` and `k` are already assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, the call to `func_2()` here will return the same values, which are then converted to a list and assigned to `prices`.

Given that `func_2()` returns values for `n` and `k`, and these are used to form the list `prices`, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The `heap` and `remaining_items` lists remain empty as they are not modified by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values of `n` and `k`.**
