To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped).
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list.
   - `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.
   - `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `combined` is an empty list.
   - `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items in `combined`.
   - `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the entire process.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `max_profit` is the key variable here. It represents the maximum profit encountered during the entire process of processing the items in `combined`.

3. **What is `max_profit`?**
   - Since `max_profit` is described as the maximum profit encountered during the entire process, it is a single numerical value that represents the highest profit achieved.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(max_profit)` statement will print the value of `max_profit`.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the maximum profit encountered during the entire process. Since the exact numerical value of `max_profit` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the process.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit encountered during the entire process)**
