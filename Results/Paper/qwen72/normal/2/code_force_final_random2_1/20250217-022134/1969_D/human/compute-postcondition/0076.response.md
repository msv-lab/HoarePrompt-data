The code snippet sorts the list `combined` based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the bonus values) in ascending order. This operation does not change the values of the elements within the tuples, only their order within the list.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, and `k` must be greater than 0.**
