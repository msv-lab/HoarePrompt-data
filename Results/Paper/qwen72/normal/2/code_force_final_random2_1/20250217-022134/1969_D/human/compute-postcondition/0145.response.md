The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder since the loop does not use the iteration variable directly. The loop's execution depends solely on the value of `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop does not modify `k` (as indicated by the placeholder `_`), the value of `k` remains the same before the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `k` is still greater than 0, and no other changes are necessary for the loop to execute again.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing its last element, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0**
