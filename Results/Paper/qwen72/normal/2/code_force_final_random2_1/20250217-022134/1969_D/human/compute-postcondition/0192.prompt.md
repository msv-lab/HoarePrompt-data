Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing its last `k` elements, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than the previous value of `max_profit`, and `k` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, and `combined` now has one less element. `heap` now includes `item` and the smallest element in `heap` before the operation is removed and stored in `removed_item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of `item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, including the new `item` and excluding the smallest element before the operation, which is stored in `removed_item`. `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, and `combined` now has one less element, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, `heap` now includes `item` and the smallest element in `heap` before the operation is removed and stored in `removed_item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of `item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, including the new `item` and excluding the smallest element before the operation, which is stored in `removed_item`. `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, and `combined` must have at least one element remaining. `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, `heap` now includes `item` and the smallest element in `heap` before the operation is removed and stored in `removed_item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of `item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. `combined` has one fewer element.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
