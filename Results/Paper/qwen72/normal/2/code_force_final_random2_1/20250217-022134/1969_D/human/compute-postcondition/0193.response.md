To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
   - `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`.
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list.
   - `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.
   - `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `combined` is an empty list.
   - `current_profit` is the final value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `func_2()` returns values that are used to initialize `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses`.
   - `prices` and `bonuses` are lists of values.
   - `neg_prices` is a list of negated values of `prices`.
   - `combined` starts as an empty list but is populated during the loop.
   - `current_profit` is updated during the loop.
   - `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop.

3. **Loop Context:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements, updating `current_profit` and `max_profit` based on the values in `prices` and `bonuses`.
   - `max_profit` is the highest value of `current_profit` seen during the loop.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(max_profit)` statement will print the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the maximum profit calculated during the loop. Since the exact values of `prices` and `bonuses` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `max_profit`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum profit.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum value of current_profit observed during the loop)**
