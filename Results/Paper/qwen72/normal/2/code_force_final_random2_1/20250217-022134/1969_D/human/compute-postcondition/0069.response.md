Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit calculated during the loop, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_2()`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
