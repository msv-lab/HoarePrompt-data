To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **`test_cases`**: Must be greater than 0.
2. **`heap`**: A list containing the last `k` elements of `combined`, where each element is a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`.
3. **`remaining_items`**: An empty list.
4. **`n` and `k`**: Assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.
5. **`prices`**: A list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
6. **`neg_prices`**: A list containing the negated values of `prices`.
7. **`bonuses`**: A list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
8. **`max_profit`**: The maximum profit calculated during the loop.
9. **`current_profit`**: Initialized to 0.
10. **`combined`**: An empty list.
11. **`k`**: Must be greater than 0.

Given this initial state, the `print(max_profit)` statement will print the value of `max_profit`.

### Explanation:
- **`max_profit`** is described as the maximum profit calculated during the loop. Since the exact details of the loop and the calculations involved are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `max_profit`.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, `max_profit` is the result of some computation involving the elements of `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses`.

### Output:
Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit calculated during the loop)**
