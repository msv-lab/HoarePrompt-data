Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is now `k+2` elements shorter, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. `heap` now contains the last `k` elements of `combined` with the new `item` added and the smallest element (based on the first element of the tuple) removed, which is stored in `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` function pushes `item` onto the heap and simultaneously pops and returns the smallest element from the heap.
- The variable `removed_item` is assigned the smallest element that was removed from the heap.
- The heap now contains the last `k` elements of `combined` with the new `item` added and the smallest element removed.
- If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`.
- Depending on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is updated accordingly.
- Finally, if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- All other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
