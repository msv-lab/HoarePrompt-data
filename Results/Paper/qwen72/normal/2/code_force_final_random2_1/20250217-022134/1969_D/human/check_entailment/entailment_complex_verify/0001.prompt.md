You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:`func_4` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` to determine the number of test cases. For each test case, it retrieves data using `func_2` and processes this data to calculate the maximum profit possible under certain conditions. The function uses a heap to manage and optimize the selection of items based on their prices and bonuses. After processing all test cases, the function prints the maximum profit for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies and processes the data internally.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases.
   - It uses `func_2` to read the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists of prices `a` and `b`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The program creates a list `combined` that pairs the negative of Alice's prices with Bob's prices.
   - This list is sorted based on Bob's prices in ascending order.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is used to keep track of the top `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - The first `k` items from the sorted `combined` list are pushed into the heap.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing up the profits from the items in the heap and the remaining items.
   - The program iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap to ensure that the top `k` items are always the ones Bob will take for free.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program ensures that Alice maximizes her profit by considering the best possible combination of items to buy and sell to Bob.
   - The use of a heap helps in efficiently managing the top `k` items that Bob will take for free, ensuring that the profit calculation is optimal.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items available.
   - The logic ensures that the profit is calculated correctly even when the number of items is small.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the use of a heap ensures that the optimal strategy is followed for both Alice and Bob.
