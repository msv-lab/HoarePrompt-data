To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `combined`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `combined` is not empty.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the state indicates that `combined` is a sorted list of tuples, and it has been shortened by `k` elements.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must still contain elements.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop condition depends solely on `combined` being non-empty, no adjustments are needed to the other variables like `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, or `item`.
- The only requirement is that `combined` must still contain elements after the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
Given that the state already specifies that `combined` is a sorted list and has been shortened by `k` elements, but not necessarily made empty, the loop can proceed as long as `combined` still has elements.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, if `combined` was not empty, `combined` is now `k` elements shorter, and `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. `heap` now contains the last `k` elements of `combined` with the new `item` added and the smallest element (based on the first element of the tuple) removed, which is stored in `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`.**
