Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, including the new `item` and excluding the smallest element before the operation, which is stored in `removed_item`. `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, and `combined` now has one less element, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, `heap` now includes `item` and the smallest element in `heap` before the operation is removed and stored in `removed_item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of `item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Additionally, if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is further increased by the first element of `item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is further reduced by the first element of `removed_item`.**
