The only object in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one element), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `combined` is described as a sorted list of tuples that is now `k` elements shorter. To ensure the loop can execute, `combined` must contain at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k` elements shorter and must contain at least one element. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. In all cases, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`**
