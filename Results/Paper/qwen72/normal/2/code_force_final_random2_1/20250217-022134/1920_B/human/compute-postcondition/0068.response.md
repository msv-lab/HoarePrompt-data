The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Here's the detailed impact on the program:

- `ans` is updated to include the new element `sums`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` is a list containing the value `sums` (if `i` is not 1) or `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]` (if `i` is 1).
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

After executing `ans.append(sums)`:
- `ans` now includes the value of `sums` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums` (if `i` is not 1) or `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]` (if `i` is 1) followed by the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
