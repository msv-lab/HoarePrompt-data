The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` must be at least -1
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is not 0
- The current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`

After executing the code:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
