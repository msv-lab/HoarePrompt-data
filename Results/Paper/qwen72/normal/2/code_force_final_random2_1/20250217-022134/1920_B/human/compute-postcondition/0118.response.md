Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to its current value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The new value of `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.
