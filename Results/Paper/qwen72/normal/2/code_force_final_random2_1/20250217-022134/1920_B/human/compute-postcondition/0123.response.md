To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

### Logic:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
   - `i` is initialized to `k + 1`.
   - `ans` is initialized to a list of `k + 1` elements.

2. **First Element in `ans`:**
   - The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

3. **Subsequent Elements in `ans`:**
   - For each subsequent element in `ans`:
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value in the list `ans`.

### Explanation:
- The list `a` is reversed and sorted, meaning it is sorted in non-increasing order.
- The first element in `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, which subtracts twice the sum of the first `x` elements from the total sum of the list.
- Subsequent elements in `ans` are updated based on the conditions described, effectively adjusting the sum by adding and subtracting specific elements from the list `a`.

### Final Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value in the list `ans`, which is the result of the described operations on the list `a`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, each representing the value of sums after each iteration of the loop, starting with sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) and updated based on the conditions provided)**
