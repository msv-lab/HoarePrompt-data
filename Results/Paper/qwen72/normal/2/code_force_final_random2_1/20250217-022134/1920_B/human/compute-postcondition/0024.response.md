Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. After appending `sums`, `ans` now contains two elements, both of which are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
