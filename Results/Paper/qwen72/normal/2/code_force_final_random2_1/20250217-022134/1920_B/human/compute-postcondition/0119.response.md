The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` before this operation, meaning `sums` includes the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` which is now `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
