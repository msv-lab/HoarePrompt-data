Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `sums` is now equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.** 

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. All other variables remain unchanged, except for `sums` which is now specifically calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
