The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies the list `ans` by appending the value of `sums` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and now also contains an additional element which is the current value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
