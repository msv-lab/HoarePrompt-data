Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, this value is now the first element of the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
