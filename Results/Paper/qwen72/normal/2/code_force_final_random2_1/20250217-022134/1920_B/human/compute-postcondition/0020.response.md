Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains one element which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.***
