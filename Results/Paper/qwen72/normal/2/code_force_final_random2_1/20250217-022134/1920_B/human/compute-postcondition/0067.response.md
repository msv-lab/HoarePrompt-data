The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to the current value of `sums`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State Review**:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - If `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing one element `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - If `i` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`.
   - If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.

4. **Unchanged Variables**:
   - `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` remains 1.
   - `n` remains an input integer.
   - `k` remains an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - `x` remains an input integer.
   - `a` remains a reversed list of integers from the input.
   - `sum1` remains the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
   - `i` remains incremented by 1.
   - `ans` remains a list containing the value `sums` (if `i` is not 1) or `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]` (if `i` is 1).

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums` (if `i` is not 1) or `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]` (if `i` is 1), `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
