The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `ans` was initially `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.
- After appending `sums`, `ans` becomes `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`.**
