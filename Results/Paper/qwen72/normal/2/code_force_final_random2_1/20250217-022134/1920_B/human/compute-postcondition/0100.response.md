Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `(i + x - 1 >= n)`, and `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.
- The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` before this line of code is executed.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
