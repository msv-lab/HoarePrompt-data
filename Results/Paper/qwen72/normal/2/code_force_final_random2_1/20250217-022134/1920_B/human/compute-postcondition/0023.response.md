The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Since `ans` initially contains one element which is also `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, appending `sums` to `ans` results in `ans` having two identical elements, each being `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `i` is 1.**
