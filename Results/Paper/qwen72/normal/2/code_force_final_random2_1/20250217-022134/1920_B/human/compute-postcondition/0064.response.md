Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sums]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` contains one element `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.
- After appending `sums`, `ans` now contains two elements: `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sums]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
