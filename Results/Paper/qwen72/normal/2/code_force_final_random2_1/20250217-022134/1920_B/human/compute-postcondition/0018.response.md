The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation does not change the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The only change is that `ans`, which was initially an empty list, now contains one element, which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, `(i + x - 1)` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
