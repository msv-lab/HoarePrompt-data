The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i-1` from the list `a` to it. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 2.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `k` remains an input integer and must be at least 0.
- `x` remains an input integer.
- `a` remains a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` remains the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
- `i` remains not 0.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- The condition `(i + x - 1 >= n)` remains true.

The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is an empty list, `(i + x - 1 >= n)`, and `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
