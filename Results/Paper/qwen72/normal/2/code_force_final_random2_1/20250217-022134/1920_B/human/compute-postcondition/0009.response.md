Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `a[:x]` is a slice of the list `a` containing the first `x` elements.
- `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of the first `x` elements in the list `a`.
- `2 * sum(a[:x])` is twice the sum of the first `x` elements in the list `a`.
- `sums` is then assigned the value of `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in the list `a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
