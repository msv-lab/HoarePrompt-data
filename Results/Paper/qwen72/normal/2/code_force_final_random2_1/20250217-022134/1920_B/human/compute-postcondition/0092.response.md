The code calculates the value of `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. Here's the detailed step-by-step calculation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `_` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans` is an empty list

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
     - `sum(a[:x])` calculates the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`.
     - `2 * sum(a[:x])` multiplies this sum by 2.
     - `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` subtracts this value from `sum1` and assigns the result to `sums`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
