The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`
- `i` is not 0
- `ans` is an empty list
- The current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`

After executing the code:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
