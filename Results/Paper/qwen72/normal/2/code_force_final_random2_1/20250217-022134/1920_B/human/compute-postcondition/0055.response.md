Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `i + x - 1` is less than `n` still holds true.
