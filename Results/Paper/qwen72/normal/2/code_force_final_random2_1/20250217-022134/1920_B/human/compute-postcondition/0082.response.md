To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements.
  - The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
  - For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`):
    - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
    - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - This means the first element is the sum of all elements in the original list minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the reversed list.

2. **Subsequent Elements of `ans`**:
   - For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`):
     - `i` starts at `k + 1` and increments by 1 for each iteration.
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value among all elements in the `ans` list.

### Final Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value in the `ans` list. The exact value depends on the specific values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the elements in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, with the first element being sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), and subsequent elements calculated based on the conditions described)**
