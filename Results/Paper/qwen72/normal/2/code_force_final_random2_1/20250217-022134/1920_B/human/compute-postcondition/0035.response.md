Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are calculated based on the conditions provided and the third element is `sums`, `sums` is now `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`.**
