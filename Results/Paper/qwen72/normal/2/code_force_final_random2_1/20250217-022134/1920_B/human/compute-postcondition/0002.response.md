The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`.

- The initial state includes: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.
- After executing the code, the variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
