To determine what will be printed by the `print(suma)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `numCases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `numInteger` is an input integer.
   - `numbers` is an empty list.
   - `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `numbers` is initially an empty list.
   - The variable `suma` is defined as the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.
   - Since `numbers` is empty, there are no pairs of integers to remove, and thus no minimum values to sum.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `numbers` is empty, `suma` will be 0 because there are no elements to contribute to the sum.

Therefore, the output of the `print(suma)` statement will be:

Output: **0**
