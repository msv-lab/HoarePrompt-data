Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must contain at least one element (but now with one less element), `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.** 

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning this value to `b`. Since `a` was already the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` now holds the integer value of what was the second element in the original list. All other variables remain unchanged.
