The value of `b` is updated to the integer value of the first element that was removed from the `numbers` list. The `numbers` list is now one element shorter, and the remaining elements are still sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must contain at least one element (but now with one less element), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers` (if applicable).**
