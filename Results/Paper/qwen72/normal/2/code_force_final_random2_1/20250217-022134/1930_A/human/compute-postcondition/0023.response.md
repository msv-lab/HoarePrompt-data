Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings representing the input values split by spaces, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The code `numbers = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces.
- The variable `numbers` now contains a list of strings, each representing an input value.
- All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, and `suma`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
