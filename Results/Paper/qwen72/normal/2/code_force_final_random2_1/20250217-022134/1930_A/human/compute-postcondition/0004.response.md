The code snippet `numbers.sort(reverse=False)` sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order.**
