To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `numCases`. The loop will execute if `numCases` is greater than 0. The variable `t` and the details about `n` and the list of integers are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition, but they provide context for what happens inside the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- A list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `numCases` is an integer input by the user, which should be within the range 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000.

For the loop to execute, `numCases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0 (the default starting point for `range`).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
