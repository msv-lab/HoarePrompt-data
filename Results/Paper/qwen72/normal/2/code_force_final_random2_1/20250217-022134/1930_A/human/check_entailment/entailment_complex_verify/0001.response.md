### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`numInteger`) and the list of integers (`numbers`).

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the goal is to maximize the sum of the minimum values of the pairs. By sorting the list, we ensure that when we take pairs, the smaller numbers are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

3. **Pairing and Summing**:
   - The function then enters a loop where it repeatedly takes the first two elements from the sorted list (`a` and `b`), converts them to integers, and adds the minimum of these two values to the sum (`suma`). This process continues until the list is empty.
   - The use of `pop(0)` to remove the first two elements and add the minimum value to the sum is correct.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the function prints the sum (`suma`).

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is optimal for maximizing the sum of the minimum values.
  - The use of `pop(0)` to remove the first two elements and add the minimum value to the sum is correct.
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles the smallest possible input (e.g., `n = 1`).
  - It also handles larger inputs up to the constraints provided (e.g., `n = 50`).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The pairing and summing step has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
