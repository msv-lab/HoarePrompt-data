Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of 2n integers. The function calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and prints this sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables in their final processed states. Specifically, `numCases` remains equal to the initial number of test cases, `i` is equal to `numCases`, `numInteger` is the last input integer read, `numbers` is an empty list, and `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers for the last test case. **
