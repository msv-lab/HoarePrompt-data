Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it processes the list of numbers. Specifically, the `numbers` list is obtained from the input but is not converted to integers before sorting. This means that the list is sorted lexicographically as strings, not numerically as integers. This can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, the list should be converted to integers before sorting. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly sort the numbers as integers and produce the expected output.
