The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `b`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `b` is now assigned the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`.
- The list `numbers` now has one fewer element, and the remaining elements are still sorted in ascending order.

The other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `suma`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must contain at least one element (but now with one less element), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.**
