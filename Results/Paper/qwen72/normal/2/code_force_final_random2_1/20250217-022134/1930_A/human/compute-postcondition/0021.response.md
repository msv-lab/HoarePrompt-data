The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `numCases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `numCases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `numCases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `numCases` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.**
