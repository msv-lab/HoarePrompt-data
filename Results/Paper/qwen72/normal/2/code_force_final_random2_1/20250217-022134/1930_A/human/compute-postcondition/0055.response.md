Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must not be empty (but now missing its first five elements), `a` is the integer value of the fifth element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the fourth element that was removed from `numbers`, `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`**

Explanation:
- The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns its integer value to `a`.
- Initially, `numbers` was missing its first four elements, so the first element being removed now is actually the fifth element from the original list.
- The value of `a` is updated to the integer value of this fifth element.
- The list `numbers` is now missing its first five elements.
- The values of `t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `b`, and `suma` remain unchanged.
