The code snippet `suma += min(a, b)` updates the value of `suma` by adding the minimum of `a` and `b` to its current value. Given that `suma` is initially `2 * min(a, b)`, after the addition, `suma` will be `3 * min(a, b)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order with six fewer elements and must contain at least one element, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`, `suma` is `3 * min(a, b)`.**
