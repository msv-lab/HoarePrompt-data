### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - This matches the problem description, which specifies that the input is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Calculating Prefix Balances:**
   - The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `char`.
   - If the character is '(', it increments the balance by 1.
   - If the character is ')', it decrements the balance by 1.
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the list `details`.
   - This step correctly calculates the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the negative index and the character. The negative index ensures that when sorting, ties in balance are broken in decreasing order of position.

3. **Sorting the Details:**
   - The function sorts the `details` list.
   - The sorting is done based on the first element (balance) in ascending order and the second element (negative index) in ascending order, which effectively sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order.
   - This matches the problem description's requirement for sorting the columns of the table.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The function constructs the result string by extracting the third element (character) from each tuple in the sorted `details` list.
   - It joins these characters into a single string and prints it.
   - This correctly forms the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the resulting shuffled string.
   - This matches the problem description's requirement for the output.

### Verification Against Function Summary:
- The function summary states that the function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", which forms a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- It processes this string and prints the reversed version of `s`.
- However, the function does not reverse the string; instead, it performs the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
- The function does not return any value, and the original string `s` remains unchanged, which is consistent with the function's behavior.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required, and there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors that would cause it to fail for any valid input within the constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
