The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `char`, and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. The variable `i` should start at 0, and `char` should be the first character of the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `balance` is 0, `details` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`**
