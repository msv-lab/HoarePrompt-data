You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", which forms a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It processes this string and prints the reversed version of `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the original string `s` remains unchanged, and the reversed string is printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix for each character in the input string `s`. It increments the balance for an opening parenthesis `'('` and decrements it for a closing parenthesis `')'`.

2. **Details Collection**:
   - The program collects the balance, the negative position (to handle tie-breaking in descending order), and the character itself in a list called `details`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance in ascending order and, in case of ties, by the negative position in descending order. This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - The program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the resulting string, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input string.

### Verification:

- **Example Input**: `(()(()))`
  - **Balance Calculation**:
    - Position 1: `(` -> Balance: 1
    - Position 2: `(` -> Balance: 2
    - Position 3: `)` -> Balance: 1
    - Position 4: `(` -> Balance: 2
    - Position 5: `(` -> Balance: 3
    - Position 6: `)` -> Balance: 2
    - Position 7: `)` -> Balance: 1
    - Position 8: `)` -> Balance: 0
  - **Details List**:
    - [(1, -1, '('), (2, -2, '('), (1, -3, ')'), (2, -4, '('), (3, -5, '('), (2, -6, ')'), (1, -7, ')'), (0, -8, ')')]
  - **Sorted Details List**:
    - [(0, -8, ')'), (1, -7, ')'), (1, -3, ')'), (1, -1, '('), (2, -6, ')'), (2, -4, '('), (2, -2, '('), (3, -5, '(')]
  - **Result String**:
    - `()(()())`

The program correctly handles the example and should work for other valid inputs as well.
