Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `balance` is 0 because the sequence is balanced. `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in `s`, where each tuple is in the form `(balance, -i, char)`, with `balance` representing the current balance of parentheses, `-i` representing the negative index of the character, and `char` being the character from `s`. `i` is the last index of the string `s` (i.e., `len(s) - 1`).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- For each character, if it is '(', the `balance` is incremented by 1; if it is ')', the `balance` is decremented by 1.
- The `details` list is updated with a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` for each character, where `balance` is the current balance of parentheses, `-i` is the negative index of the character, and `char` is the character itself.
- Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the final `balance` will be 0 after all iterations.
- The `details` list will contain a tuple for each character in `s`, reflecting the changes in `balance` and the position of each character.
- The variable `i` will be the last index of the string `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`.
