Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. If `char` is '(', `balance` is 2 if the first character of `s` is '(' or 0 if the first character of `s` is ')', and `details` is a list containing two tuples: `(balance, 0, first_char)` and `(balance, -1, second_char)`. If `char` is ')', `balance` is 0 if the first character of `s` is '(' or -2 if the first character of `s` is ')', and `details` is a list containing two tuples: `(balance + 1, 0, first_char)` and `(balance, -1, second_char)`. In both cases, `i` remains 1 and `char` is the second character of `s`.**
