The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", which forms a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It processes this string and prints the reversed version of `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the original string `s` remains unchanged, and the reversed string is printed to the console.
