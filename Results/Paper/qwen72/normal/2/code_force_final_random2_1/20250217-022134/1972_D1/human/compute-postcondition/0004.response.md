Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`. The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the condition `(i + j) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0` are printed.**

Explanation:
- The code iterates over the range from 1 to `a` (inclusive) for `i` and from 4 to `b` (inclusive) for `j`.
- For each pair `(i, j)`, it checks if `(i + j) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0`.
- If the condition is true, the pair `(i, j)` is printed.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The only effect of the code is to print the pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy the given condition.
