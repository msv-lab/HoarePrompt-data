The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` being less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than or equal to `b`. Since `b` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `b` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, then `suma` is set to `a`, `x` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `suma` remains 0 and `x` remains \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1\).**
