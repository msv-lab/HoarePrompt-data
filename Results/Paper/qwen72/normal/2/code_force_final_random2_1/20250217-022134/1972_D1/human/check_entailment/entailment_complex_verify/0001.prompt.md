You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import  math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        """for i in range(1,a+1):
                for j in range(4,b+1):
                    if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:
                        print(i,j)"""
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        
        print(suma - 1)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is `T-1`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the last input, `a` is the integer value of the last `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of the last `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates a value `suma` based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`. Finally, it prints `suma - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state includes `T` being the total number of test cases processed, `a` and `b` being the last input values for the final test case, and `suma` being the calculated value for the final test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The commented-out code block is not executed and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The main logic is in the loop where it calculates the number of valid pairs.
   - The variable `suma` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

4. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, it seems to be an approximation and might not always be accurate.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) correctly.
   - However, the final result is `suma - 1`, which might be incorrect if there are no valid pairs for some \(i\).

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The output for the given test cases should match the expected results. However, the formula used might not always produce the correct count.

Given the complexity of the problem and the specific formula used, it is difficult to definitively state the correctness without further verification. However, based on the provided reasoning, the program seems to have logical issues and might not always produce the correct results.
