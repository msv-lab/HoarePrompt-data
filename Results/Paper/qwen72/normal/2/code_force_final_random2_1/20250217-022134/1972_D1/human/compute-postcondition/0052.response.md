Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, then `suma` is set to `a`, `x` is now \((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1\). Otherwise, `suma` remains 0 and `x` is now \((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `x` using the expression \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- Given `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to \((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1\), which further simplifies to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).
- The value of `x` is updated to this new expression.
- The conditions for `suma` remain unchanged, and the values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.
