Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 3. If `a - 3 * (3 - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is set to \((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3\) and `x` is also set to \((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3\). Otherwise, `suma` remains 0 and `x` remains \((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3\).***
