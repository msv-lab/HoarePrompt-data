Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the loop and the calculation inside the loop do not correctly implement the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` iterates over `b`, but the problem requires iterating over both `a` and `b`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the condition `if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:` do not correctly reflect the required condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Subtraction of 1**: The final `print(suma - 1)` is arbitrary and does not have a clear justification in the context of the problem.

To illustrate the incorrectness, consider the test case `(2, 3)`:
- The valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`.
- The program's output for this test case is incorrect because it does not correctly count these pairs.

A correct implementation would involve nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition for each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case.
