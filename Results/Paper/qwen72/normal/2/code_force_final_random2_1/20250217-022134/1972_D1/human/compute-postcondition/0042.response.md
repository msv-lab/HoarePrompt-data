Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).

Code:
```
info = input().split()
```

Impact of the code:
- The `info` variable is updated to be a list of strings obtained from the new input.
- The previous values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `suma` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).**
