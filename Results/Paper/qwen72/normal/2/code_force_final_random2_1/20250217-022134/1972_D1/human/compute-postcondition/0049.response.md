The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given the initial state, `suma` was initially 0, and `x` is calculated as \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1\), which simplifies to `a // 1`, which is just `a` since integer division by 1 does not change the value. Therefore, `suma` is now equal to `a`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is `a`, `x` is `a`, and the expression `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0.**
