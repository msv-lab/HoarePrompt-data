The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` relative to `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0 and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1, and `T` must still be greater than `t`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) **
