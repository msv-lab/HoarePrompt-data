Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 1\). If \(a - 3 * (3 - 1) > 0\) (i.e., \(a > 6\)), `suma` is set to \(a + (a - 2) // 2 + ((a - 6) // 9) + 1\). If \(a <= 6\), `suma` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.***
