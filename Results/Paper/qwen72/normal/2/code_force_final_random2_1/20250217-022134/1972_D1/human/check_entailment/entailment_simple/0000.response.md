Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of \( b \) and calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range for \( j \)**: The commented-out loop uses `range(4, b+1)` which skips the first three possible values for \( b \). This is incorrect because \( b \) should start from 1 and go up to \( m \).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The main logic in the program calculates the number of valid pairs using the formula:
   ```python
   x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
   ```
   This formula does not correctly account for the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The formula seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but it does not match the problem's requirements.

3. **Subtraction of 1**: The program subtracts 1 from the final result:
   ```python
   print(suma - 1)
   ```
   This subtraction is not justified by the problem statement and may lead to incorrect results.

4. **Handling of GCD**: The program does not use the greatest common divisor (GCD) in the main calculation, which is crucial for determining whether \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
