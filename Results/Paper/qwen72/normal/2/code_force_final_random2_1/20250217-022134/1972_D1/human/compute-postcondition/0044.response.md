The provided Python code snippet is a nested loop that iterates over a range of values for `i` and `j`, and checks a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `i` and `j`. However, the code does not modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`). It only prints certain pairs of `i` and `j` when the condition is met.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 1
- `t` is 2
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1
- `i` is `b`
- `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\)

After executing the provided code snippet, none of the variables in the initial state are modified. The code only performs some computations and prints results, but it does not change the values of any variables.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).**
