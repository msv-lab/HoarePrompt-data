Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, and `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is updated to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.***
