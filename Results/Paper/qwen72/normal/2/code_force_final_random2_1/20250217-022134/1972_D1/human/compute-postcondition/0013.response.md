The value of `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is calculated as \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\), the new value of `suma` is the original value of `suma` (which is 0) plus \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\), `i` is 2, `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\)**.
