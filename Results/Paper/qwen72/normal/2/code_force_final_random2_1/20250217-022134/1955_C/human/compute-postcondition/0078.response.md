Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, and `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - (a[0] * 2)`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[0]`, and if `a[r]` becomes 0, `sunks` is 2 or 3 and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, `sunks` remains 0, 1, or 2 unless `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, in which case `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3.***
