    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is `n` or `r + 1`, `r` is `l - 1` or less, and `sunks` is the total number of elements removed from the list `a` during the loop execution. The loop terminates when `l` exceeds `r` or when `k` is less than the required amount to perform any further operations on the elements of `a`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of elements (`sunks`) removed from the list `a` during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list), `k` (a positive integer representing a limit), and `a` (a list of positive integers). It processes the list `a` by removing elements based on the value of `k` and the values of the elements in `a`. The function returns the total number of elements removed from the list `a` during its execution. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and `k` remain positive integers within their initial constraints, `a` is modified by having some elements potentially reduced or removed, and the function returns the count of elements removed (`sunks`).
