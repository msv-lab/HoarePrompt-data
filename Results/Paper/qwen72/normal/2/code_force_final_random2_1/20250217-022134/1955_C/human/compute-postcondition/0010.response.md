Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0, and `l` is equal to `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is set to 1, `k` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.***
