Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, and `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - (a[r+1] * 2)`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r+1]`, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is updated to 1, 2, or 3, and `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` but `a[r] * 2 == k`, then `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 != k`, `sunks` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the program state remains unchanged.***
