The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, and `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
