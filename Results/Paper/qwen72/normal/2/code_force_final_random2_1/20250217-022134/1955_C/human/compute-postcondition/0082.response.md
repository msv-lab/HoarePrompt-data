The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `a[r] * 2` from its current value. The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. Since `k` is a positive integer and `a[r]` is a positive integer, the new value of `k` will be `k - a[r] * 2`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`.**
