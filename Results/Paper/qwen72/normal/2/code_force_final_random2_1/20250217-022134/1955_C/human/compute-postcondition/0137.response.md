Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list), `k` (a positive integer representing a limit), and `a` (a list of positive integers). It processes the list `a` by removing elements based on the value of `k` and the values of the elements in `a`. The function returns the total number of elements removed from the list `a` during its execution. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and `k` remain positive integers within their initial constraints, `a` is modified by having some elements potentially reduced or removed, and the function returns the count of elements removed (`sunks`). **
