Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 1, `k` is 0 or greater, `l` is equal to `r`, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the value of `a[r]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
