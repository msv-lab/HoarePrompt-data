You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` reaches 0, the loop breaks, indicating no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink the single remaining ship. If so, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink both the first and last ships. If so, it updates `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` accordingly. If not, it breaks the loop.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it performs similar checks and updates.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all ships are sunk correctly.
   - It also handles the case where no ships are sunk correctly.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the problem description. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary checks to determine the number of sunk ships.
