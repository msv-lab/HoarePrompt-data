The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the list `val`, so we can only adjust these.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `val`. If there are more tuples in `val`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` was the last one processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must still contain at least one more tuple to process. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `m - 2` is at least 1, meaning `val` initially had at least 1 tuple. After processing one tuple, `val` should still have at least one more tuple left for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the next tuple `(a3, l3)` will be the next element in `val`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
