Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
