Postcondition: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates). If `idx2 == -1` and `idx1 != -1`, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were initially, which could be either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`. `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 depending on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.**
