To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `_` and the expression `range(m - 2)`.
- For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one element. This means `m - 2` must be greater than 0.
- Therefore, `m` must be greater than 2.

### Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized explicitly.

### Final State:
State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `m` must be greater than 2**
