Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early due to conditions being met, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, and `l` is now equal to `l1`.**
