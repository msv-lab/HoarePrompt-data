Postcondition: **`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is equal to 2, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1. If `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
