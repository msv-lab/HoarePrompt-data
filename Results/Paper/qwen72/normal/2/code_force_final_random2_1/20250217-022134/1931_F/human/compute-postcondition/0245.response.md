Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 3.
- `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
- `a3` is the first integer from the first tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first tuple in `val`.
- The list `l3` does not contain all elements of the list `l` except for `a3`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a constant string.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **no**
