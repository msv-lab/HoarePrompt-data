The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement would have no effect in this scenario. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.**
