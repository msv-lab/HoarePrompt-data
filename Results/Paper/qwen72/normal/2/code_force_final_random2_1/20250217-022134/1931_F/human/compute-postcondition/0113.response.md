Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the new tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to it, `_` is 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**

Explanation:
- The line `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a new input line, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.
- The values of `a3` and `l3` are updated based on the new input.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `_`) remain unchanged.
