Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the following conditions apply: If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and the current value of `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `idx1 = idx2 = i` sets both `idx1` and `idx2` to the current value of `i`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
