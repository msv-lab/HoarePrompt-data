Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new input, `m` is greater than 3, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous value, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`.
- `a3` and `l3` retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
- `m` remains greater than 3.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
