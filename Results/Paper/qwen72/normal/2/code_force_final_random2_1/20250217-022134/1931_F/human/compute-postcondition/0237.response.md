The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` must be greater than 2
- `a3` is the first integer from the input
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`

After executing the code, the new values of `a3` and `l3` are updated based on the new input. The value of `val` remains unchanged because it is not modified by the code.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the initial state.**
