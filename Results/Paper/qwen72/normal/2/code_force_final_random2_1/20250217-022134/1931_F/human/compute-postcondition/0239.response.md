The only variable in the loop head is `m`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2. Since the loop counter `_` is not used, it does not affect the state.

At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 2, but since the loop counter is not explicitly incremented or modified, the only change is that the loop has executed one more time, reducing the number of remaining iterations by 1. Therefore, `m` must now be greater than 3 to ensure that `m - 2` is still greater than 0.

State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` from the initial state.**
