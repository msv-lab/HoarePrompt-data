The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at the position `idx2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l11`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Given the conditions:
- If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is non-negative, `idx2` is set to `n - 2`.
- Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values.
- `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early due to conditions being met, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**
