To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The expression `n - 1` determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than 0.
   - This means `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.
   - The initial state provides that `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input. However, we need to explicitly state that `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - `m` is at least 3 (no change needed).
   - `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (no change needed).
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (no change needed).
   - `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input (ensure `n` is greater than 1).
   - `a1` is the first integer from the user input (no change needed).
   - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input (no change needed).
   - `a2` is the first integer from the new user input (no change needed).
   - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input (no change needed).
   - `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (no change needed).
   - `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1` (no change needed).
   - `idx1` is -1 (no change needed).
   - `idx2` is -1 (no change needed).
   - `p1` is 0 (no change needed).
   - `p2` is 0 (no change needed).

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0**
