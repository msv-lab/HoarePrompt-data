Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is 1. If `i + max(1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, then `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, 1)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.**
