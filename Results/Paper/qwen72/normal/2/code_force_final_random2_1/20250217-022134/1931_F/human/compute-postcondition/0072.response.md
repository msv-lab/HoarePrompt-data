Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` but `l2[i + p2] != a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is 1. If `i + max(1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution normally. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` but `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, 1)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution normally. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, then neither `idx1` nor `idx2` are updated, and the program continues execution normally. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative at any point, the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
