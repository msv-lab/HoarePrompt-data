Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `i`, `n`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
