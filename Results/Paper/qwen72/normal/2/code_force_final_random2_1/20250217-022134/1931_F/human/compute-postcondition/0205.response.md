Postcondition: ***`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, and `n` is greater than the number of iterations. The loop terminates when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or when both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to a non-negative value. The final values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` depend on the specific elements of `l1` and `l2` and the positions where `l1[i + p1]` does not match `l2[i + p2]`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index `i` where this condition is met, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` become non-negative, the loop also breaks. `val` is an empty list. If `idx1` is -1 and `idx2` is not -1, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2`.***
