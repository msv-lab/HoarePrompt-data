Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing at least three tuples, `a3` is the first integer from the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the third tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of all elements in `l` except `a3`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
