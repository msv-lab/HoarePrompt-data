To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Current State:
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 2`.
- If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the same conditions apply as before.
- If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, the loop continues.
- If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1.
- If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1.
- If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, the loop continues under the same conditions.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i < n - 1`.
3. **Current State of `i` and `n`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `n` are such that `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 2`.
4. **Adjusting `i`**: After the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
5. **Adjusting `n`**: The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`. Since `i` is now `i + 1`, the new condition becomes `(i + 1) < n - 1`, which simplifies to `i < n - 2`.

### New State:
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 3`.
- If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the same conditions apply as before.
- If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, the loop continues.
- If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1.
- If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1.
- If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, the loop continues under the same conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 2, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 3`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
