The `input()` function reads a line from input, but since no variable is assigned to store this input, it does not affect the state of any variables in the program. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`**
