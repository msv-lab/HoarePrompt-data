The code appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` already contains the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` from the initial state, after executing the code, `val` will contain three instances of the tuple `(a3, l3)`. The values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)`, `(a3, l3)`, and `(a3, l3)` from the initial state.**
