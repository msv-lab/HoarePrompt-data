Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first tuple in `val`. Additionally, the list `l3` does not contain all elements of the list `l` except for `a3`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
