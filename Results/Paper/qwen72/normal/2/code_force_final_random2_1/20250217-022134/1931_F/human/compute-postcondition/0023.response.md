Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**
