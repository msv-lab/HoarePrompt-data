The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a3` and `l3`, and the list `val`. The loop iterates over the tuples in `val`, assigning the first element of each tuple to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple in `val` to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing at least two tuples, `a3` is the first integer from the second tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the second tuple in `val`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must contain at least three tuples, and the next tuple (the third tuple) will be processed, with `a3` being the first integer from the third tuple in `val`, and `l3` being the list of the remaining integers from the third tuple in `val`.

State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing at least three tuples, `a3` is the first integer from the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the third tuple in `val`.**
