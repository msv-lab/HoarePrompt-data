Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `m` is 1, the loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- `a2` is assigned the first integer from the latest input.
- `l2` is updated to be a list of the remaining integers from the latest input.
- All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previous values and conditions.
