Output State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`; all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]` updates the list `l22` to contain only the elements from `l2` that are not equal to `a1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
