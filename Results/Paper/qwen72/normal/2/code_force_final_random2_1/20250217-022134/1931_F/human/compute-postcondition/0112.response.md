The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a counter for the loop. The loop will execute if `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, and `m` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` must still be greater than 2 (specifically, `m` must be greater than 3 for `_` to be less than `m - 2`).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the new tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to it, `_` is 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
