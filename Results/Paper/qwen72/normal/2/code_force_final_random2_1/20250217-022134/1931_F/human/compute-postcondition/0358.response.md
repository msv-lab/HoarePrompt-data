Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates). If `idx1 > idx2`, `l1` now contains the value of `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, and `l` is a reference to `l1`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, `l` is a reference to `l1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; otherwise, `l` is a reference to `l2`, which contains `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`. Both `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, and `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 depending on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered.***
