Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. If `m` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
