The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splitting them by spaces, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged by the code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers.**
