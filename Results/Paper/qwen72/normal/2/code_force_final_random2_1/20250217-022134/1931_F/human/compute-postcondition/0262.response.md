Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input. Since the condition `m == 1` cannot be true given the precondition that `m` is at least 3, the program does not enter the if block, and the state remains unchanged.***
