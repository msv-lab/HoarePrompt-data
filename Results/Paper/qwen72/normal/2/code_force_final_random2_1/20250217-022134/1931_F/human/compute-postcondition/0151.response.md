Output State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, and the program has waited for user input for each iteration. If `l11` is equal to `l22`, no changes are made and the program continues as usual. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**
