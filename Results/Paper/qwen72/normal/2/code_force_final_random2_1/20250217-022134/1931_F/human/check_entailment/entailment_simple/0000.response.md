### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Single Screenshot:**
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program correctly prints "yes" because a single screenshot can always be valid.

2. **Handling Multiple Screenshots:**
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and processes them to check if they can be derived from the same original order.
   - It creates lists `l11` and `l22` by removing the author of the other screenshot from each list.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, it immediately prints "no" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the remaining lists are not the same, the screenshots cannot be from the same order.

3. **Finding the Insertion Points:**
   - The program then tries to find the positions where the authors of the screenshots should be inserted to make the lists match.
   - It uses indices `idx1` and `idx2` to track these positions and adjusts the lists accordingly.

4. **Handling the Third Screenshot (if present):**
   - If there are more than two screenshots, the program reads the third screenshot and uses it to determine the correct insertion point.
   - It checks the relative positions of the authors in the third screenshot to decide which list to modify.

5. **Final Validation:**
   - The program then reads the remaining screenshots and checks if they match the modified list.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "no"; otherwise, it prints "yes".

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial check for a single screenshot.
- It correctly processes the first two screenshots to determine if they can be derived from the same order.
- It correctly finds the insertion points and modifies the lists accordingly.
- It correctly validates the remaining screenshots against the modified list.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
