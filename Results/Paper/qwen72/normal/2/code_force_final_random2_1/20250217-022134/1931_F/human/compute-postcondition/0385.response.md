Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers, `n` and `k`, and a list of lists `a` where each sublist represents the order of participants shown to a specific participant. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating the solution for each set of inputs based on the given constraints and relationships.**
