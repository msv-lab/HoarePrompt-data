To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `val` in the loop head. According to the given state, `val` will contain `m-2` tuples after all iterations of the loop, where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. For the loop to execute, `val` must contain at least one tuple.

Given that the loop iterates over the tuples in `val`, the loop will execute if `val` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `val` contains at least one tuple.

State: **`val` must contain at least one tuple, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `a3` and `l3` are the first elements of the first tuple in `val`**
