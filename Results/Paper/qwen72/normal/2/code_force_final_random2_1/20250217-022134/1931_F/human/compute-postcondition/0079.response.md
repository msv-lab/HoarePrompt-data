Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, indicating the positions where `l1` and `l2` differ by `a1` and `a2`. `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, depending on whether a mismatch was found and adjusted. The loop has completed all iterations, and `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early due to conditions being met. `val` is an empty list. `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is non-negative, indicating that `l2` does not differ from `l1` by `a2` but `l1` differs from `l2` by `a1`.**
