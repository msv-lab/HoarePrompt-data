To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `s1`: A string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n`: A positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre`: A list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `totalOne`: The number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>').
   - `preOne`: A list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>').
   - `suffZero`: A list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>'.
   - `ans`: A list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions).
   - `i`: `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `el`: The character at index `i` in `s1`.
   - `ol`: Equal to `totalOne`.
   - `zr`: Equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.

2. **Analyze the Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet assigns the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` to the variable `zeroInd`.
   - `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments: `suffZero` and `ol`.
   - The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine its specific behavior. However, we can infer that it returns a value based on the inputs `suffZero` and `ol`.

3. **Determine the Impact on the Program:**
   - The only variable that changes is `zeroInd`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State Calculation:

- `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- The value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is not specified, so we represent it as `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol).**
