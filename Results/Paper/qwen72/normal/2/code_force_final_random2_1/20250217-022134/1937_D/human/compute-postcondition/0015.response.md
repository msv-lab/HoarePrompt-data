Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `oneInd`.
- The value of `oneInd` is calculated as the sum of the results of two calls to the function `func_1` with arguments `(preOne, zr)` and `(preOne, zr + 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `oneInd` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the contents of `preOne` and `zr`. However, since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, the value of `oneInd` is expressed in terms of the function calls.
