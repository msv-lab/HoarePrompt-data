The list comprehension iterates over the string `s1` and collects the index `i + 1` for each character `el` in `s1` that is equal to '>'. This means `pre` will contain the indices (1-based) of all '>' characters in `s1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.**
