Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains two elements [0, `i + 1`]. `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, and `oneInd` has changed. If `zr` is greater than `ol`, then `suffZero` contains two elements [0, `n`], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 except the last element which is `n - (2 * the sum of the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, and `zeroInd` is `n`, `oneInd` is 2 * the sum of the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.***
