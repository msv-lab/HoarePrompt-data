### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it meets the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly. Let's break down the requirements and the implementation:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - A one-dimensional grid of length `n` with characters '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character and inverts the character after moving.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each for a different starting cell, and output the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function calculates the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element that is `times` positions back from the end. It is used to help compute the positions and times in `func_2`.

   - **`func_2`**: This function processes the string `s1` to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.
     - It initializes lists `pre` and `preOne` to keep track of positions of '>' characters and their cumulative sums.
     - It initializes `suffZero` to keep track of the cumulative positions of '<' characters from the end.
     - It iterates through the string from the end to the beginning, updating the lists and computing the time for each cell.
     - The logic inside the loop handles the different cases based on the current character ('<' or '>') and the positions of other characters.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the string and computes the time for each cell.
   - The use of `accumulate` and the logic for handling the positions of '<' and '>' characters ensures that the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters are correctly simulated.
   - The output is printed in the required format, and the function handles all edge cases (e.g., when the string is all '<' or all '>').

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the logic in both functions, the program appears to meet the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
