Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 0, `ans[n-1]` is set to its previous value, and `preOne` is now missing its last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans[n-1]` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code.
- The list `preOne` is now one element shorter, specifically the last element has been removed.
