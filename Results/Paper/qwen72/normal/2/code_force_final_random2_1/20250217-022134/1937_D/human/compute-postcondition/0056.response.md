Output State: **`zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `zeroInd` is updated to the value calculated by the expression `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
- No other variables are mentioned as being affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The initial state mentions that `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]`, which remains valid as it is not altered by the given code snippet.
