### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s1` itself.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is responsible for processing the string `s1` and calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
   - It initializes `pre` with the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
   - It uses `accumulate` to create `preOne`, which is a prefix sum array of `pre`.
   - It initializes `suffZero` with a single element 0, which will be used to keep track of the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string.
   - It initializes `ans` as a list of zeros of length `n` to store the results.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the string `s1` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each character `el` in `s1`:
     - If `el` is '>', it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the `func_1` function and updates `ans[i]`.
     - It then pops the last element from `preOne` and decrements `totalOne`.
     - If `el` is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the `func_1` function and updates `ans[i]`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)` from the end of `arr`.
   - It is used to help compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all characters in `s1`, the program prints the results stored in `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- **Functionality:** The logic in `func_2` and `func_1` appears to correctly implement the rules for the pinball's movement and the calculation of the time it takes to leave the grid.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as strings with only '<' or only '>' characters.
- **Efficiency:** The use of prefix sums and cumulative sums helps in efficiently calculating the required values.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
