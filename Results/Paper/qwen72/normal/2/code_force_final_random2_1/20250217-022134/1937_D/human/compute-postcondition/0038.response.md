To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>').
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>').
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>'.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions).
- `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

### Impact of the Code:
- The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- The function `func_1` is called with arguments `suffZero` and `ol`. The result of this function is multiplied by 2 and stored in `zeroInd`.

### Calculation:
- `suffZero` is a list that contains the indices of zeros in the string `s1` (or possibly some other context-specific meaning).
- `ol` is the value of `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>').
- The function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we know it returns a value based on `suffZero` and `ol`.
- Let's denote the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` as `result_func_1`.
- Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * result_func_1`.

### Output State:
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- `zeroInd` is now `2 * result_func_1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`.**
