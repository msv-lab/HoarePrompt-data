To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>'.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.
   - `zeroInd` is 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet assigns a new value to `oneInd`.
   - `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the `preOne` list, which represents the cumulative sum of all elements in `pre`.
   - `func_1(preOne, 1)` is a function call that we need to assume returns some value. For the purpose of this analysis, let's denote the return value of `func_1(preOne, 1)` as `func_result`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_result`

### Output State Calculation:
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_result`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_result`.**
