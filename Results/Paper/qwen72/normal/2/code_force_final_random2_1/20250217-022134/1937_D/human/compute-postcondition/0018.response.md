Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[n-1]` is `n - oneInd + 1 - fi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
- Given that `i` is `n - 1`, `ans[n-1]` is updated to `0 - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, which simplifies to `n - oneInd + 1 - fi`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
