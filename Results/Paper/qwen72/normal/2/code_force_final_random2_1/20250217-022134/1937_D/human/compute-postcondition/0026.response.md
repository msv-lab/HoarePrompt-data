The code snippet `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` calculates the value of `zeroInd` by adding the last two elements of the `suffZero` list.

Given the initial state:
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains two elements `[0, i + 1]`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `suffZero[-1]` is the last element of `suffZero`, which is `i + 1`.
- `suffZero[-2]` is the second-to-last element of `suffZero`, which is `0`.

Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as:
- `zeroInd = (i + 1) + 0 = i + 1`.

Since `i` is `n - 1`, we can substitute `i` with `n - 1`:
- `zeroInd = (n - 1) + 1 = n`.

Thus, the value of `zeroInd` is `n`.

The output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the addition of the new value of `zeroInd`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains two elements [0, `i + 1`], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`.**
