The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the `ans` list at the index `i` with the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`. Given the initial conditions, let's break down the changes:

- `i` is `n - 1`, which means it points to the last index of the `ans` list.
- `zeroInd` is 0.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_result`.

The value of `ans[n - 1]` is updated to `0 - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_result)`, which simplifies to `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_result)`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the last element set to `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_result)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_result`.**
