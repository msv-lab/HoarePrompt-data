### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, we output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition is possible, we output "NO".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(ch)`**: This function checks if the string `ch` is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the first half of the string is the reverse of the second half (or the second half plus the middle character if the length is odd).
   - **`func_2(ch)`**: This function returns an integer based on the length of `ch` and whether the first half of `ch` is a palindrome. The integer values (1, 2, 3, 4) are used to guide the partitioning logic in the main loop.

3. **Main Loop Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - It first checks if the string `s` consists of the same character repeated. If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because a string of the same character repeated is always a palindrome.
   - If `T1` is still `True`, it calls `func_1(s)` to check if `s` itself is a palindrome. If `s` is a palindrome and its length is greater than 3, it calls `func_2(s)` to determine how to partition `s`.
   - Based on the value returned by `func_2(s)`, it attempts to partition `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is a single character or a palindrome of length 1 or 2.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the string is a repeated character.
   - The partitioning logic is designed to ensure that no part is a palindrome, and it uses the results from `func_1` and `func_2` to guide the partitioning.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It checks for palindromes, handles edge cases, and attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings as required.
