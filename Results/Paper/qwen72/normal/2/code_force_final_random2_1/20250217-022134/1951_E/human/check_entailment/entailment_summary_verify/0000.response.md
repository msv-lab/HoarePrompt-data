### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and the problem requirements step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Partition the string into non-palindromic substrings**.
2. **For each test case, print "YES" if such a partition exists, otherwise print "NO"**.
3. **If "YES", print the number of parts and the parts themselves**.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Check if a string is a palindrome.
   - **Implementation**: The function checks if the first half of the string is equal to the reversed second half.
   - **Issue**: The implementation is incorrect. It should compare the entire string with its reverse, not just the halves. For example, "abcba" is a palindrome, but `func_1("abcba")` would return `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determine the number of parts to partition the string.
   - **Implementation**: The function returns an integer based on the length of the string and the result of `func_1(ch[:b])`.
   - **Issue**: This function does not perform the actual partitioning. It only returns a number, which is not useful for solving the problem. Additionally, the logic for determining the number of parts is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

#### Missing Logic:
- **Partitioning Logic**: The program lacks the logic to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
- **Output Format**: The program does not print the required output format as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided functions do not address the problem requirements adequately. Specifically:
- `func_1` is incorrect in checking for palindromes.
- `func_2` does not perform the necessary partitioning and returns a number without ensuring non-palindromic substrings.
- The program is missing the logic to partition the string and print the results in the required format.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
