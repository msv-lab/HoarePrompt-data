### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the string `s` for each test case and initializes some variables (`T1`, `T2`, `a`, `x`).

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (`s == s[0] * len(s)`). If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because such a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If `T1` is still `True` after the special case check, the program calls `func_1(s)` to check if `s` itself is a palindrome.
   - If `s` is a palindrome and its length is greater than 3, it calls `func_2(s)` to determine how to partition `s`.

4. **Partitioning Logic:**
   - The program uses the value returned by `func_2(s)` to decide how to partition the string:
     - If `a == 0`, it means the string can be used as a single part.
     - If `a == 1`, it tries to partition the string into two parts around the middle.
     - If `a == 2`, it further checks for valid partitions by iterating through possible splits.
     - If `a == 3` or `a == 4`, it partitions the string into two parts around the middle.

5. **Output:**
   - If `T1` is still `True` after all checks and partitioning, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If `T1` is `False` at any point, it prints "NO".

6. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1(ch)` checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome. It correctly handles both even and odd lengths.
   - `func_2(ch)` determines the type of partition needed based on whether the first half of `ch` is a palindrome.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the required cases and logic correctly. It correctly identifies when a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and provides the appropriate output. The helper functions are also implemented correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
