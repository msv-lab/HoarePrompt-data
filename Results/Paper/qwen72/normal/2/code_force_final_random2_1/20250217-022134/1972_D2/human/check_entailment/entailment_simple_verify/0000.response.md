Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Pair Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

3. **GCD Condition**: The program uses the `math.gcd` function to compute the GCD of `x` and `y`. It checks if the GCD is 1, which is a necessary condition for the pair to be valid. However, the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not fully captured by just checking if the GCD is 1. The program should also ensure that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The program iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` and counts the number of valid pairs using the condition \( \text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 \). However, this alone is insufficient to ensure that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The program needs to explicitly check this condition.

5. **Output**: The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above points, the program does not fully capture the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
