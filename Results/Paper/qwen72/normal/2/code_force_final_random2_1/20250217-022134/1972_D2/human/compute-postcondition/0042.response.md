To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 20.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 5.
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, and the GCD of `x` and the current value of `y` is 1.

### Code:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` ≥ 20
   - `m` ≥ 5
   - `x` = 4
   - `y` = 1
   - `cnt` is calculated based on the initial conditions.

2. **Calculate `cnt` Before Execution**:
   - We need to calculate the initial value of `cnt` based on the given formula.
   - For `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 (which is 0 in this case, since `y` starts at 1 and the final value of `y` is also 1), the only relevant value is `y = 1`.
   - The GCD of `x` (4) and `y` (1) is 1, so we include this in the calculation.
   - Calculate `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for `y = 1`:
     - `n // ((x + y) * x) = n // ((4 + 1) * 4) = n // 20`
     - `m // ((x + y) * y) = m // ((4 + 1) * 1) = m // 5`
     - `min(n // 20, m // 5)` is the value added to `cnt`.

3. **Update `cnt`**:
   - After the initial calculation, `cnt` is updated by adding `min(n // 20, m // 5)`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Since `n` ≥ 20 and `m` ≥ 5, both `n // 20` and `m // 5` are at least 1.
   - Therefore, `min(n // 20, m // 5)` is at least 1.
   - Let's assume the initial value of `cnt` is 0 (since it's not specified otherwise).
   - After the code execution, `cnt` will be `0 + min(n // 20, m // 5)`.

### Output State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 20.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 5.
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is now `min(n // 20, m // 5)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 20, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `cnt` is `min(n // 20, m // 5)`.**
