To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input and must be at least 2.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `cnt` is 1 + the minimum of (`n` // 3) and (`m` // 6) if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 1.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.
   - Substituting the current values:
     - `(x + y) * x = (1 + 3) * 1 = 4`
     - `(x + y) * y = (1 + 3) * 3 = 12`

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must still hold true after the next iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that:
     - `(x + y) * x <= n` should still be true.
     - `(x + y) * y <= m` should still be true.

5. **Current Values**:
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 4 (since 4 <= n).
   - `m` must be at least 12 (since 12 <= m).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the values of `n` and `m` must be such that the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` remain true. Since `x` and `y` are not changing in the loop head, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `n` and `m`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input and must be at least 4 and 12 respectively, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 1 + the minimum of (`n` // 3) and (`m` // 6) if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 1**.
