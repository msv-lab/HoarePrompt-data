To determine what will be printed when the `print(cnt)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input.
- `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `x`:**
   - `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
   - For example, if `n = 15`, then `x` would be 4 because `4 * 4 = 16` which is greater than 15.

2. **Initialize `y` and `cnt`:**
   - `y` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.

3. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over all possible pairs `(x, y)` where `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n` and `y` ranges from 1 to `m`.
   - For each pair `(x, y)`, if the pair satisfies the conditions, `cnt` is incremented.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The exact conditions for a valid pair `(x, y)` are not explicitly stated in the initial state, but typically, such problems involve checking if the pair meets some specific criteria (e.g., `x * y <= n` or some other condition).
   - Since the conditions are not specified, we assume the loop simply counts all pairs `(x, y)` where `x` is fixed and `y` ranges from 1 to `m`.

5. **Calculate `cnt`:**
   - If `x` is fixed and `y` ranges from 1 to `m`, the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` is simply `m` because `y` can take any value from 1 to `m`.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the value of `cnt` will be `m` because there are `m` valid pairs `(x, y)` where `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n` and `y` ranges from 1 to `m`.

Output: **m (where m is the second positive integer provided by the input)**
