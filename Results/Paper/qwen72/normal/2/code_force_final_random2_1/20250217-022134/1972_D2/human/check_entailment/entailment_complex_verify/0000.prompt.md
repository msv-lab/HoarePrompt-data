You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: m (where m is the second positive integer provided by the input)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It then calculates the number of pairs (x, y) such that 1 <= x, y, (x + y) * x <= n, and (x + y) * y <= m, with the additional condition that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y is 1. After performing this calculation, the function prints the count of such valid pairs. The final state of the program includes the printed count, and the original values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This matches the problem description.

2. **Pair Calculation**: For each test case, the program calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

3. **GCD Condition**: The program uses the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. It checks if the GCD is 1, which simplifies the condition to \(b \cdot 1\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The program iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` and counts the number of valid pairs using the condition \( \text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 \). It ensures that the pairs `(a, b)` are within the bounds specified by `n` and `m`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above points, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
