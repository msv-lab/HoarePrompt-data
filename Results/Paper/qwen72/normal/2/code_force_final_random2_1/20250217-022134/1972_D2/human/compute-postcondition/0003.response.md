The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's condition, `t` is decremented implicitly by the loop mechanism.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called** 

However, to be more precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous iteration), `func_1()` has been called**
