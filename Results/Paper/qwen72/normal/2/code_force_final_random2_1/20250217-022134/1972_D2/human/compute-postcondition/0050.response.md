The code snippet updates the value of `cnt` by adding the minimum of two expressions: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Expression 1:** `n // ((x + y) * x)`
   - `x + y` is `4 + 3 = 7`.
   - `(x + y) * x` is `7 * 4 = 28`.
   - `n // 28` is the integer division of `n` by 28. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 28, the minimum value of `n // 28` is 1.

2. **Expression 2:** `m // ((x + y) * y)`
   - `x + y` is `4 + 3 = 7`.
   - `(x + y) * y` is `7 * 3 = 21`.
   - `m // 21` is the integer division of `m` by 21. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 21, the minimum value of `m // 21` is 1.

The minimum of these two expressions is 1. Therefore, `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 28, `m` is greater than or equal to 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
