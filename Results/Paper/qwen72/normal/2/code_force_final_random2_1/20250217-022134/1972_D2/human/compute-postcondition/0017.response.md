Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input and must be at least 4 and 12 respectively, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, `cnt` is 1 + min(n // 3, m // 6) + min(n // 4, m // 12).**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The GCD of `x` (which is 1) and the new value of `y` (which is 4) is still 1, so the condition for calculating `cnt` remains true. Therefore, `cnt` is calculated as `1 + min(n // 3, m // 6) + min(n // 4, m // 12)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
