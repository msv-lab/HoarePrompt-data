The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. Since the GCD of `x` (which is 4) and the new value of `y` (which is 2) is not 1, the condition for calculating `cnt` as `min(n // 20, m // 5)` is no longer met.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 20, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is no longer defined by the GCD condition.**
