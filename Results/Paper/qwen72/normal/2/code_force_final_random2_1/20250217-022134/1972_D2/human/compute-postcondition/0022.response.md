To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 9.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

### Substituting the Initial Values:
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 1.

So, the conditions become:
1. `(3 + 1) * 3 <= n` → `4 * 3 <= n` → `12 <= n`
2. `(3 + 1) * 1 <= m` → `4 * 1 <= m` → `4 <= m`

### Analysis:
- The condition `12 <= n` must be satisfied for the first condition to hold true.
- The condition `4 <= m` must be satisfied for the second condition to hold true.

Given that `n` must be at least 9, the condition `12 <= n` is already satisfied because 9 is less than 12. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, the condition `4 <= m` must be explicitly stated to ensure the loop can execute.

### Final State:
Since `n` is already at least 9, and `m` must be at least 4, the state can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `n` must be at least 9, and `m` must be at least 4**.
