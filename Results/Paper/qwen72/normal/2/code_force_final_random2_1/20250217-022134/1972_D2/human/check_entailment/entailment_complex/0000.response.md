Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.
   - The function correctly handles the input and the number of test cases as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` to find pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime, which is necessary for the gcd condition to hold.
   - The function correctly counts the number of valid pairs and prints the result.

3. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - The logic for finding valid pairs is implemented correctly.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should work within the given limits.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Correctness: **True**
