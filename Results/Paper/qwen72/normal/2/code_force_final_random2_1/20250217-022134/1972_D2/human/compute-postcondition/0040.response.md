To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input.
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 16.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

### Substituting the Initial Values:
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 1.

So, the conditions become:
1. `(4 + 1) * 4 <= n` → `5 * 4 <= n` → `20 <= n`
2. `(4 + 1) * 1 <= m` → `5 * 1 <= m` → `5 <= m`

### Analysis:
- The condition `20 <= n` must be satisfied for the first part of the loop condition.
- The condition `5 <= m` must be satisfied for the second part of the loop condition.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 16 (as stated in the initial conditions), `n` already satisfies `20 <= n` because 20 is greater than 16.

However, `m` is only specified as a positive integer, and there is no specific lower bound given. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `m` must be at least 5.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 20 (since it must satisfy both the initial condition and the loop condition).
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 5.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 20, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1**.
