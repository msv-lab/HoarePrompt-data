The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 20, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 3, and `cnt` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 20, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 3, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**
