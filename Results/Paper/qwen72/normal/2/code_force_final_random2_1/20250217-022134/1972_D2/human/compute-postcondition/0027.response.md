To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true. The variables involved in these conditions are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1. If the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 12, m // 4)`.
- `n` must be at least 9, and `m` must be at least 4.

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting `x = 3` and `y = 2`, we get `(3 + 2) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `15 <= n`.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting `x = 3` and `y = 2`, we get `(3 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `10 <= m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
- `15 <= n`
- `10 <= m`

Since `n` must be at least 9 and `m` must be at least 4, and the current values of `x` and `y` are 3 and 2 respectively, the conditions `15 <= n` and `10 <= m` must be satisfied for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the values of `x` and `y` because they are already set to 3 and 2, respectively. The values of `n` and `m` must remain such that `n` is at least 15 and `m` is at least 10.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1. If the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 12, m // 4)`. `n` must be at least 15, and `m` must be at least 10.**
