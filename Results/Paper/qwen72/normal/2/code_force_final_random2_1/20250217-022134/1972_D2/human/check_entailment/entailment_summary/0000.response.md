Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to ensure that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions for each test case.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( m \) where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \).
   - The first line of the input contains the number of test cases \( t \) where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).

2. **Conditions for Valid Pairs:**
   - \( 1 \leq a \leq n \) and \( 1 \leq b \leq m \).
   - \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) must be a multiple of \( a + b \).

### Function Analysis:
- **`func_1`:**
  - This function reads \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
  - It iterates over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) to find pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the conditions.
  - Specifically, it checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) and if \( (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \leq m \).
  - If these conditions are met, it counts the number of valid pairs.
  - Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

- **`func_2`:**
  - This function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Input Handling:**
  - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
  - For each test case, `func_1` is called, which reads \( n \) and \( m \) and processes them.

- **Condition Checking:**
  - `func_1` correctly checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).
  - It also ensures that \( (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \leq m \).
  - The counting mechanism is correct, as it uses the minimum of the two possible bounds to count valid pairs.

- **Output:**
  - `func_1` prints the count of valid pairs for each test case.
  - `func_2` ensures that this process is repeated for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output as required and performs the necessary calculations to count the valid pairs.

Correctness: **True**
