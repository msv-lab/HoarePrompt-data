Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 20, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, and the GCD of `x` and the current value of `y` is 1.**
