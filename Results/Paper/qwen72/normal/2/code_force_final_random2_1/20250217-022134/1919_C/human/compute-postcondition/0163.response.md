Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer that must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is 3, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[3]`, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `l[3]` because `y` is 3, and `l[y]` refers to the element at index 3 in the list `l`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
