Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` and `y < n - 1` if such an index exists, otherwise `y` is `n - 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[n - 1]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] >= a` and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] >= b` and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. If `l[x] >= a` and `l[x] >= b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[n - 1]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. If `l[x] >= a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] >= b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. `n` must be greater than `y + 2`.**
