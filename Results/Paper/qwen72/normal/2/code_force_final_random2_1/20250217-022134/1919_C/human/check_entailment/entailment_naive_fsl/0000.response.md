Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 3 2 4 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
1
```

### Explanation:
- **Expected Output**: The optimal way to split the array `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]` to minimize the penalty is to split it into `s = [1, 2, 5]` and `t = [3, 4]`. The penalty for `s` is 1 (since `2 < 5`) and the penalty for `t` is 1 (since `3 < 4`). Therefore, the total penalty is `1 + 1 = 2`.

- **Actual Output from the Program**: The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.

The program's logic for splitting the array and calculating the penalty is flawed. It does not correctly identify the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty in all cases. Specifically, the logic for updating `a` and `b` and counting the penalty `c` does not always result in the minimum possible penalty.
