Postcondition: **_ is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `c` remains as it was before the loop started. If `a` (the first element of `l`) is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to the value of `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` and `a` remains the first element of `l`.**
