Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer that must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is 3, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[3]` if `l[3]` is greater than `l[2]`, otherwise `b` remains 0, and `c` is 0. If `l[3]` is greater than `l[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
