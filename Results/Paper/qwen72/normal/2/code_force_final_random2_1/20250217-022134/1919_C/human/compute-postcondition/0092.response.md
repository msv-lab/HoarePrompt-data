Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is 3, `b` and `c` remain unchanged. If `l[3]` (i.e., `l[y]`) is greater than `l[2]` (i.e., `l[y - 1]`), `b` is set to the fourth element of `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
