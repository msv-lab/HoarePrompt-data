Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated and is less than `n - 1`, `c` remains as it was before the loop started. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is the value of `l[y + 2]`. Otherwise, `b` is now equal to `l[y + 2]`.**
