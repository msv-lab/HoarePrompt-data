Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `c` remains as it was before the loop started. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
