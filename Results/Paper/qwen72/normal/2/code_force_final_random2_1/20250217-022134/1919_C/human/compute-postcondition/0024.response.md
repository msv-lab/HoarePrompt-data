Output State: **`a` is the value of `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `x` starts from `y + 1`, and the current value of `l[x]` is greater than both the previous `a` and `b`. Additionally, the difference between `l[x]` and the previous `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**
