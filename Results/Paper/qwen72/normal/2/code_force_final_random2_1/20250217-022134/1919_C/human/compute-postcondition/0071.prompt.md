Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: If `l[y]` is greater than `l[y-1]` for any `y` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[y]` where this condition is first met, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `b` remains 0. The value of `y` will be the index where the condition was first met, or `n-1` if the condition was never met. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged as the first element of `l` and 0, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is the first element of `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0. `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, and `x` starts from `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition. `c` is 1 more than its previous value if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` remains 0. `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, or `l[x]` if the if condition is not met. `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met. `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 1 more than its previous value if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` remains 0, `b` is either 0, the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, or `l[x]` if the if condition is not met, `x` is incremented by 1, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, and `n` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
