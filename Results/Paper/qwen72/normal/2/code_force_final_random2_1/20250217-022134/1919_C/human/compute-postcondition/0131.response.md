Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 3`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated and is less than `n - 1`, `b` remains as it was before the loop started, `a` is now equal to `l[y + 3]`, `n` must be greater than `y + 3`.**
