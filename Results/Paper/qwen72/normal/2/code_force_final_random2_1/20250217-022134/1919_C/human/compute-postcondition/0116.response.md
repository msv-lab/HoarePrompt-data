Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `b` and `c` remain as they were before the loop started. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] > b - l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is less than `l[x]`.**
