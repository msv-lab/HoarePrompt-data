Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, and `x` starts from `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`.***
