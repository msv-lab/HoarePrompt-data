Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `l`, `c` is 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `x` starts from `y + 1`, and the current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`.***
