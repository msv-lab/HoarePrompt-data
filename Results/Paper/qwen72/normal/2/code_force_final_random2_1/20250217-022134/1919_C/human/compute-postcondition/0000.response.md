To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

This means the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases.
- Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
- The total number of test cases, `t`, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the result of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts should reflect this requirement.

State: **The input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
