Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` or `n - 1` if no such index exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[y]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` for some `y`, otherwise `b` remains 0, and `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` and `y < n - 1` if such an index exists, otherwise `y` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[y]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` for some `y`, otherwise `b` remains 0, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[n - 1]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. Otherwise, `c` is 0, and `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] >= a` and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] >= b` and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` and `y < n - 1` if such an index exists, otherwise `y` is `n - 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[n - 1]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] >= a` and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] >= b` and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. If `l[x] >= a` and `l[x] >= b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[n - 1]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. If `l[x] >= a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] >= b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. `n` must be greater than `y + 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is `y + 3`, and `n` is greater than `y + 3`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then either `a` or `b` is the element at index `y + 3` in list `l`, and `c` is increased by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` is set to `l[y + 3]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
