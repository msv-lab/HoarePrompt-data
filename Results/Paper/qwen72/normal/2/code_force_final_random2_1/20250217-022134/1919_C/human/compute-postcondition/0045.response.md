Output State: **`a` is now `l[x]`, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` (previously) and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `x` is `x + 1`, `n` is unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to the current value of `l[x]`. The conditions for `c`, `b`, and `y` remain the same as they were initially. The value of `x` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.
