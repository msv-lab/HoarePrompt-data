Postcondition: **_ is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` and `y < n - 1` if such an index exists, otherwise `y` is `n - 1`, `a` is either the first element in `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])`, `b` is either `l[y]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` for some `y` or `l[x]` depending on the same condition, and `c` is 0. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is less than `b`.**
