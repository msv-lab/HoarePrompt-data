The value of `p` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This calculation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. The value of `res` remains the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.**
