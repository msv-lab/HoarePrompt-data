The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, which consists of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and produces an output for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function `func` should accept these inputs and return a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not detailed, I'll assume the function returns some processed result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
