The code snippet `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. Since `b` was already defined as a sorted list of integers from `a`, this operation does not change the contents of `b`. However, it ensures that `b` remains sorted.

Let's go through the impact on each variable:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` remains a list of integers extracted from the string `case`.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `num` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `num2` remains an input integer.
- `case` remains an input string.
- `op` remains 1.
- `b` remains a sorted list of integers from `a`.
- `median` remains the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
- `new_median` remains the same as `median`.
- `b[ma]` remains `median + 1`.

Since the sorting operation does not change the list `b`, the output state is identical to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is the same as `median`, `b[ma]` is `median + 1`.**
