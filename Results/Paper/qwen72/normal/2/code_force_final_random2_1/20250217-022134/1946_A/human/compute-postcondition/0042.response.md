The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print(16668)
```

This statement prints the integer `16668`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `num` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0

None of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement, as it simply prints the constant integer `16668`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **16668**
