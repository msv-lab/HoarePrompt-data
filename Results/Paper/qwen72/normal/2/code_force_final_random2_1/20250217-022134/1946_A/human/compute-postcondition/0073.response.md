The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `num` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is an input string.
- `op` is 0.

None of these variables or conditions affect the execution of the `print` statement, as it simply prints the constant integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **1**
