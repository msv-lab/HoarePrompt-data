Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0. If `num2` > 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `op` is the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `b[ma]` is incremented by the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before any increments, and `new_median` is equal to `median + 1`.**
