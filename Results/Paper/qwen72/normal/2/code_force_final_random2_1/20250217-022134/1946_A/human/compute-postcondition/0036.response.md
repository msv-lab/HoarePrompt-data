Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0. If `num2` > 10000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `b[ma]` is incremented by the number of times the loop has executed, `median` is the final value of `b[ma]` plus 1, and `new_median` is the final value of `b[ma]`.**
