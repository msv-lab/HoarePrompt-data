Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is the number of times the loop executed, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `median + op`, `b[ma]` is `median + op`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment the value at index `ma` in the list `b` until `new_median` (which is the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`) is greater than `median`.
- Each iteration of the loop increments `b[ma]` by 1, sorts the list `b`, and updates `new_median` to the new value at index `ma`.
- The variable `op` keeps track of the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- After the loop finishes, `new_median` will be exactly one more than the final value of `median` before the loop exits, and `b[ma]` will be `median + op`.
