The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each with an array of integers. Specifically, the function is expected to handle:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to return some result based on the processing of these test cases and arrays. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a result based on the processing of these test cases and arrays, but the specific nature of the return value is not specified.**
