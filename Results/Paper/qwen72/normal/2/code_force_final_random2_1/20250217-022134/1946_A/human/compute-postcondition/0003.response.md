The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This impacts the value of `n`, which now holds the new input value. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
