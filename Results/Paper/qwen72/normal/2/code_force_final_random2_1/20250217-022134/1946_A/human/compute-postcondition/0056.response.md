To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition specified in the `while` loop head, which is `new_median <= median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `new_median` is equal to `median`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `new_median <= median` must still hold true. Since `new_median` is currently equal to `median`, no change is required to these variables for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` is equal to `median`.**
