The value of `ma` is assigned the result of `int(num2 / 2)`. This means `ma` will be the integer division of `num2` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
