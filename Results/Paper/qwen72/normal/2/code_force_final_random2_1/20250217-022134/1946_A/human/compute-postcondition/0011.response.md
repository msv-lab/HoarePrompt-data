Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.** 

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `res` remain unchanged, but the list `a` now contains the integers provided by the user.
