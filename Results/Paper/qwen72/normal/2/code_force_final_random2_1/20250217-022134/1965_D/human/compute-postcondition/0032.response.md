Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array where 3 <= len(a) <= 1000, `i` is 2, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` from index 0 to len(a)-1, followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from index 1 to len(a)-1, and now includes the value `a[2]` at the end, `sm` is `a[2] + a[3]`, `j` is 3.** 

Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated to be the sum of `a[2]` and `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
