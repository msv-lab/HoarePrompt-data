Output State: **`prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`. The list `a` remains unchanged in this step.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `x`.
- The value of `x` is updated to the next element in the list `odds`.
- The value of `idx` is decremented by 1, becoming `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`.
- The list `a` is not modified in this step, as the code snippet only updates the variables `prev`, `x`, and `idx`.
