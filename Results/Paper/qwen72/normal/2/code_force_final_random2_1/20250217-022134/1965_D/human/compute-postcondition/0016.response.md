Postcondition: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must contain at least two elements, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of zeros of length `n`. If `idx` (which is `(n - 1) // 2`) is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then the element at index `idx` in `a` is set to `x`. Otherwise, the elements at indices `idx` and `n - 1 - idx` in `a` are set to `(x - prev) // 2` and `(x - prev) // 2` respectively. `prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`, and `x` is the next element in `odds`.**
