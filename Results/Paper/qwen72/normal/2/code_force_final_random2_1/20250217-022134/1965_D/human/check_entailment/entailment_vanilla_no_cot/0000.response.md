Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly address the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **func_1**: This function generates all possible subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted. This is used to verify the correctness of the solution by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given subarray sums.

2. **func_2**: This function identifies the unique sums that appear an odd number of times in the list of subarray sums. Since the array is a palindrome, the missing subarray sum will be one of these unique sums.

3. **func_3**: This function constructs the palindrome array `a` using the unique sums identified in `func_2`. It places the values in the middle of the array and ensures symmetry.

4. **func_4**: This function is not directly used in the main logic but could be used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums with the given list of subarray sums.

The overall approach is sound and aligns with the requirements of the problem. The functions work together to reconstruct the palindrome array from the given subarray sums, ensuring that the output is a valid palindrome. Therefore, the program is correct.
