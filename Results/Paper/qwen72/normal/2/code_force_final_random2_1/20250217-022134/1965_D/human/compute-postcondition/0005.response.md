The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `smallList` was initially a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last element already removed, removing another element from `smallList` means it now has one less element than before. The last element of `bigList` remains unchanged and is no longer necessarily equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last two elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is no longer necessarily equal to the last element of `smallList`.**
