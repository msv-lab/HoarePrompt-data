To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `len(smallList) > 0`**
   - This condition requires that `smallList` has at least one element. If `smallList` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, `smallList` must contain at least one element.

2. **Condition 2: `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**
   - This condition requires that the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. For the loop to execute, the last elements of both lists must be the same.

Given the initial state:
- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- `smallList` is a sublist of `bigList`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that:
- `smallList` is not empty.
- The last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Since `smallList` is a sublist of `bigList`, we can assume that `smallList` can be non-empty and can share the same last element as `bigList` if `smallList` is not empty.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList`, and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`**.
