The function `func_4` takes two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a sublist of `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing their last elements as long as they are equal and `smallList` is not empty. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, the function stops removing elements and returns the last element of `bigList`.
