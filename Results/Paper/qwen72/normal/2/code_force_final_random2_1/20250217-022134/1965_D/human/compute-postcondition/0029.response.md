Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, and `n`, a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000) indicating the length of the array `a` to be recovered. The function reconstructs and returns a list `a` of length `n`, where the values in `a` are derived from the elements of `odds`. The list `odds` remains unchanged. After the function executes, the list `a` will contain the appropriate values based on the elements of `odds`, and the original list `odds` will be unmodified. **
