You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

    #The program returns `cts`, which is a sorted list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from each index `i` (from 0 to `len(a)-1`) up to the end of the list. Each element in `cts` represents the sum of the elements in `a` from that index to the end of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers representing a palindrome array (with a length between 3 and 1000). It calculates all possible cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, starting from each index to the end of the list, and returns a sorted list `cts` containing these cumulative sums. The original list `a` remains unchanged.

#Function 2:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers representing the sums of subarrays of a palindrome array. It processes this list to remove consecutive duplicate elements, returning a new list `odds` that contains only the unique elements from `cts` that do not form pairs of consecutive identical elements. After the function concludes, the original list `cts` remains unchanged, and the returned list `odds` reflects the filtered elements as described.

#Function 3:

The list `a` will have a length of `n`, and its values will be determined by the elements of `odds`. The variable `prev` will be set to the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be less than 0, but these variables are not part of the return. The list `odds` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, and `n`, a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000) indicating the length of the array `a` to be recovered. The function reconstructs and returns a list `a` of length `n`, where the values in `a` are derived from the elements of `odds`. The list `odds` remains unchanged. After the function executes, the list `a` will contain the appropriate values based on the elements of `odds`, and the original list `odds` will be unmodified.

    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer. This integer is the last remaining element in `bigList` after removing the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList` until they are no longer equal or `smallList` becomes empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a sublist of `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing their last elements as long as they are equal and `smallList` is not empty. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, the function stops removing elements and returns the last element of `bigList`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input list of subarray sums might contain duplicates that are not part of the missing subarray sum. This can lead to incorrect identification of the missing subarray sum and subsequently incorrect reconstruction of the palindrome array.

For example, consider the following input:
```
n = 4
subarray_sums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10]
```
In this case, the missing subarray sum is 5, but the program might incorrectly identify another value due to the presence of duplicate sums in the input list. This can cause the final reconstructed array to not be a valid palindrome or to not match the given subarray sums.
