### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to recover a palindromic array `a` of length `n` from the sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - We are given \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) subarray sums, and we need to find the missing subarray sum to reconstruct the array `a`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and appends them to the list `cts`.
   - The list `cts` is then sorted.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The function correctly generates and sorts all subarray sums. The state after the function call is as described in the annotation.
   - **Conclusion:** This function is correct.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - It uses a stack-like approach to cancel out pairs of identical sums, leaving only those that appear an odd number of times.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The function correctly identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times. The state after the function call is as described in the annotation.
   - **Conclusion:** This function is correct.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function constructs the palindromic array `a` from the unique subarray sums identified in `func_2`.
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the unique subarray sums, placing the values in the middle of the array if the index is the same for both ends, otherwise splitting the value equally between the corresponding positions.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The function correctly constructs the palindromic array `a`. The state after the function call is as described in the annotation.
   - **Conclusion:** This function is correct.

5. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the given list of subarray sums (`smallList`).
   - It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until it finds the first mismatch, which is the missing subarray sum.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The function correctly finds the missing subarray sum. The state after the function call is as described in the annotation.
   - **Conclusion:** This function is correct.

6. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program involves:
     - Reading the input and processing each test case.
     - Sorting the given subarray sums.
     - Using `func_2` to find the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - Determining the missing subarray sum using `func_4`.
     - Constructing the palindromic array using `func_3`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The main logic correctly follows the steps described in the annotations and the problem requirements.
   - **Conclusion:** The main logic is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct and follows the logic required to solve the problem. Each function performs its intended task accurately, and the overall approach is sound.

**Final: **True**
