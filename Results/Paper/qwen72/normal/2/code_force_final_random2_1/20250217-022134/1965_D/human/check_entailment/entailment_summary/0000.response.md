### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to recover a palindromic array `a` of length `n` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n + 1 - i]` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates all possible cumulative sums of the elements in a given list `a` and returns them in a sorted list. This helps in generating the subarray sums for a given array.
   - **func_2**: This function filters out consecutive duplicate elements from a list of subarray sums, effectively reducing the list to unique elements that do not form pairs of consecutive identical elements.
   - **func_3**: This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` from the filtered list of subarray sums (`odds`). It places the values in the middle of the array and ensures the array remains palindromic.
   - **func_4**: This function compares two lists and removes matching elements from the end until they differ, returning the last element of the larger list. This helps in identifying the missing subarray sum.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic reads the input, processes the subarray sums, and uses the helper functions to identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindromic array.
   - The logic handles different cases based on the number of odd elements in the subarray sums and uses the helper functions to ensure the correct reconstruction of the array.

4. **Validation**:
   - The main logic correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and uses it to reconstruct the palindromic array.
   - The helper functions are used appropriately to filter and reconstruct the array, ensuring the final output meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to recover a palindromic array from the given subarray sums. The functions work together to handle the input and produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
