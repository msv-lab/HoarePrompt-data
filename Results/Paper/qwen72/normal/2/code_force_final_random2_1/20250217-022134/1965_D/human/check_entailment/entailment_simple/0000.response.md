Reasoning:  

The program aims to recover a palindromic array `a` from the given subarray sums, where one subarray sum is missing. The approach taken by the program involves several steps:

1. **Sorting and Identifying Odd Elements**: The program sorts the given subarray sums and identifies the elements that do not form pairs (these are considered "odd" elements). This step is crucial because in a palindromic array, most subarray sums should appear in pairs due to symmetry.

2. **Determining the Missing Sum**: The program determines the missing subarray sum by analyzing the "odd" elements. If the number of "odd" elements exceeds half the length of the array, it further categorizes them into even and odd values to identify the missing sum. Otherwise, it constructs a potential array and calculates the missing sum based on the differences between the constructed sums and the given sums.

3. **Constructing the Palindromic Array**: The program constructs the palindromic array using the identified "odd" elements and the missing sum. It fills the array from the center outwards, ensuring that the array remains palindromic.

4. **Validation and Output**: The program validates the constructed array and prints it.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted. This is used to compare with the given subarray sums to identify the missing sum. The function correctly computes the subarray sums and sorts them.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function identifies the "odd" elements in the list of subarray sums. It removes pairs of identical elements, leaving only the unique elements. This step is essential for identifying the missing sum.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function constructs the palindromic array `a` from the "odd" elements. It fills the array from the center outwards, ensuring that the array remains palindromic. The logic here is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function helps in identifying the missing sum by comparing the given subarray sums with the constructed subarray sums. It removes matching elements from the end of both lists and returns the last remaining element in the larger list. This function works correctly for the purpose of finding the missing sum.

### Potential Issues:

- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program assumes that the input is valid and that there is always a solution. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., incorrect number of subarray sums).

- **Complexity**: The program's complexity is manageable within the constraints, but it could be optimized further. For example, the sorting step in `func_1` and `func_2` can be costly for large inputs.

- **Clarity**: The code is somewhat complex and could benefit from additional comments and clearer variable names to improve readability.

### Conclusion:

Despite the potential for optimization and clarity improvements, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It follows a logical sequence of steps to identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindromic array.
