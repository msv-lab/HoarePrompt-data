To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. `len(smallList) > 0`: This condition ensures that `smallList` has at least one element.
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: This condition ensures that the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed.
- `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last two elements removed.
- The last element of `bigList` is no longer necessarily equal to the last element of `smallList`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both conditions in the `while` loop must be satisfied:
1. `smallList` must still have at least one element.
2. The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Since `smallList` is already described as non-empty (it has at least one element), the first condition is already satisfied.

For the second condition, we need to ensure that the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. Since the last elements were removed in the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the last elements of both lists are now the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last two elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`**.
