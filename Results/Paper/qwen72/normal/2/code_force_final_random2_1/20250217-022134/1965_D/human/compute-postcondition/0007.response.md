The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `bigList`. Since the last element of `bigList` was equal to the last element of `smallList`, removing it means that the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`. However, `smallList` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last two elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`.**
