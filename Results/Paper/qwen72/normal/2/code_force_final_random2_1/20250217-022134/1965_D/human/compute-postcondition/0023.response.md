Postcondition: ***`prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`, `odds` must have at least one more element. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the next element in `odds`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`.***
