Output State: **`prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`, `odds` must have at least one more element. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the next element in `odds`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `prev` is updated to the current value of `x`.
- The value of `x` remains the next element in `odds`.
- `idx` remains `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`.
- The condition `if idx == n - 1 - idx` and the subsequent assignment to `a[idx]` or `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` remain unchanged.
- The requirement that `odds` must have at least one more element is still valid.
