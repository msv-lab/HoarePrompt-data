Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
