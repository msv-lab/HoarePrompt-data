The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts each character in the stripped string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `s`.

- The initial state specifies that `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string. After executing the code, `s` is updated to a new list of integers derived from the user's input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input string, `n` is greater than `len(s)`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[count of 0s in s, count of 1s in s]`, `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s` plus the sum of 1 if `cnt[1] > 0` for each 0 in `s`.**
