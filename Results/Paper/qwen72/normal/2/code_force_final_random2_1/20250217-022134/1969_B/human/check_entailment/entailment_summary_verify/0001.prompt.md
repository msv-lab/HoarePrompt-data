You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates the sum of the number of times a '1' appears before each '0' in the string, plus the total number of '0's multiplied by the number of '1's. It prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state includes `n` being 0 (indicating the loop has completed), `s` being the last processed binary string as a list of integers, `zeroes` being the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt` being a list with the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, and `ans` being the calculated result for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it converts the input string into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counter array.
   - For each character, it calculates the cost of making the string sorted up to that point and adds it to the total cost `ans`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current character is 0, it adds 1 to the total cost if there has been at least one 1 encountered before.
   - If the current character is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeros to the total cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the string is entirely composed of 0s or 1s.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the string.
   - The space complexity is O(n) due to the list conversion and additional counters.

6. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for the provided examples:
     - For "10", the cost is 2.
     - For "0000", the cost is 0.
     - For "11000", the cost is 9.
     - For "101011", the cost is 5.
     - For "01101001", the cost is 11.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
