The code snippet checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If it is, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element.
- `c` is the second element of `s`.
- `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`.
- `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`.
- `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`.

If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element, `c` is the second element of `s`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
