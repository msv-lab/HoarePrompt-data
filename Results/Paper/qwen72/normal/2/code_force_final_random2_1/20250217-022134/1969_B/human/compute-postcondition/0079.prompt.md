You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and s is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, where each character in s is either '0' or '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the final input string, `n` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the final list `s`, `cnt` is `[zeroes, len(s) - zeroes]`, and `ans` is the sum of the number of times a 1 appears before each 0 in the final list `s` plus the total number of 0s multiplied by the number of 1s.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `s`, a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5) consisting of '0's and '1's. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
