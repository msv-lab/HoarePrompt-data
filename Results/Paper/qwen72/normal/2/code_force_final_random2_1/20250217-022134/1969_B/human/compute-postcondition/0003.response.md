The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts each character into an integer, storing the result in a list.

- The variable `s` was initially a binary string, but now it is updated to be a list of integers where each integer is the digit from the input string.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `n` must be greater than 0.**
