Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order. Specifically, the program incorrectly accumulates the cost based on the current counts of `0`s and `1`s, which does not always reflect the optimal strategy for sorting the string.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
1010
```

The expected output should be `4`, because the optimal way to sort this string is to perform two cyclic shifts on the entire string:
1. `1010` → `0101` (cost = 4)
2. `0101` → `0011` (cost = 4)

However, the program will output `2`, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Flaw:
The program calculates the cost by iterating through the string and adding to the cost based on the current counts of `0`s and `1`s. This approach does not consider the optimal way to group and shift substrings to achieve the sorted order with the minimum cost. The program fails to account for the fact that the optimal strategy often involves shifting larger substrings to minimize the total cost.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
