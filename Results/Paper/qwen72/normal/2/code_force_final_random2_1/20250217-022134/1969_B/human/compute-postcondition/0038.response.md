The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` is initially 0.
- `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the count of the digit 1 in the list `s`.

The new value of `ans` will be `0 + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, which simplifies to `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` because `c` is 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `n` is now `n - 1`.**
