### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, where the cost of a shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it converts the input string into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counter array.
   - For each character, it calculates the cost of making the string sorted up to that point and adds it to the total cost `ans`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current character is 0, it adds 1 to the total cost if there has been at least one 1 encountered before.
   - If the current character is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeros to the total cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the string is entirely composed of 0s or 1s.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the string.
   - The space complexity is O(n) due to the list conversion and additional counters.

6. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for the provided examples:
     - For "10", the cost is 2.
     - For "0000", the cost is 0.
     - For "11000", the cost is 9.
     - For "101011", the cost is 5.
     - For "01101001", the cost is 11.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function Summary**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
  - It converts the input string to a list of integers.
  - It counts the number of zeros in the string.
  - It uses a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered.
  - It iterates through the string, updating the counter and calculating the cost.

- **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
  - The cost calculation logic is correct:
    - For each '0', if there has been at least one '1' encountered, it adds 1 to the cost.
    - For each '1', it adds the number of remaining zeros to the cost.
  - This ensures that the cost is minimized by considering the optimal shifts needed to sort the string.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases correctly:
    - Strings already sorted (e.g., "0000") have a cost of 0.
    - Strings with only '0's or '1's have a cost of 0.

- **Examples**:
  - The provided examples are correctly handled by the function, confirming its correctness.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
