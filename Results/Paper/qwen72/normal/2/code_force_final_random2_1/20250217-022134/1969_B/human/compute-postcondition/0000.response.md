Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, s is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, n is an input integer.** 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 2 · 10^5. After executing the code snippet `n = int(input())`, the variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user. The conditions for `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
