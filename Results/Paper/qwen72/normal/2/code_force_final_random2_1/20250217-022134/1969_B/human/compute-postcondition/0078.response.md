The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `s` is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, where each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `s`, a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5) consisting of '0's and '1's. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters.**
