The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `30`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `30`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The range limit remains 30.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 (which is `2^1`) is non-zero, `s` contains the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains the string '0'.**
