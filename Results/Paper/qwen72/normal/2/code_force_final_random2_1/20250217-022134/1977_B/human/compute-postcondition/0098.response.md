Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing the string '0'. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 (which is `2^1`) is non-zero, `s` originally contained the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` originally contained the string '0'. Now, `s` contains an additional string '0' at the end.**
