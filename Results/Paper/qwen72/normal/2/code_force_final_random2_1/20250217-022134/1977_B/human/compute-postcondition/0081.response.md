To determine what will be printed by the `print(*s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the list `s`.

### Initial State:
- `x` is an input integer.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `nalla` is 0.
- `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0').
- `i` is 29.
- `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30).

### Transformations:
- For all indices `j` from 1 to 29 (or 30), if `s[j]` is '-1' and `s[j-1]` is '1', then `s[j]` is now '0' and `s[j-1]` is now '-1'.
- This process continues until no more such pairs are found.

### Analysis:
1. **Binary Representation of `x`**:
   - The list `s` initially contains the binary representation of `x`, with each element being either '0' or '1'.

2. **Transformation Process**:
   - The transformation rule states that if `s[j]` is '-1' and `s[j-1]` is '1', then `s[j]` becomes '0' and `s[j-1]` becomes '-1'.
   - This rule is applied iteratively until no more such pairs are found.

3. **Effect of Transformation**:
   - The transformation essentially propagates the '-1' value to the left, converting '1' to '-1' and '0' to '1' as it moves.
   - This process continues until all '-1' values have been moved to the leftmost positions where they can no longer form the pattern `-1, 1`.

### Final State of `s`:
- After all transformations, the list `s` will contain a sequence of '-1' values followed by a sequence of '0' and '1' values.
- The number of '-1' values will be equal to the number of times the pattern `-1, 1` was found and transformed.

### Example:
- Suppose `x` is 13, which in binary is `1101`.
- The initial list `s` would be `['1', '0', '1', '1']` (assuming a shorter list for simplicity).
- If we introduce a '-1' at some position, say `s[1] = '-1'`, the list becomes `['1', '-1', '1', '1']`.
- Applying the transformation:
  - `['1', '-1', '1', '1']` -> `['0', '1', '0', '1']` (since `-1, 1` is found and transformed).
- The final list `s` will be `['0', '1', '0', '1']`.

### General Case:
- For a list of length 30 (or 31), the final state will be a sequence of '-1' values followed by the remaining binary digits of `x`.

### Output:
The `print(*s)` statement will print the elements of the list `s` separated by spaces. The elements will be the binary representation of `x` after the transformation process, with any '-1' values propagated to the leftmost positions.

Output: **[final elements of s separated by spaces]** (where the final elements of `s` are the binary representation of `x` after the transformation process).

For example, if `x` is 13 and the list `s` is transformed as described, the output might be:
Output: **0 1 0 1 ...** (depending on the initial binary representation and the transformations applied).
