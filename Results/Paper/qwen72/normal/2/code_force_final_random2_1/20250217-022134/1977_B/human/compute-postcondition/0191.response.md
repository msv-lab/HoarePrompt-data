Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2, `flag` is 0. Either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
