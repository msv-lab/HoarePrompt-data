The code snippet `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. This operation modifies the list `s` by appending the string `'1'` to its end. The other variables (`x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing the string '1'.**
