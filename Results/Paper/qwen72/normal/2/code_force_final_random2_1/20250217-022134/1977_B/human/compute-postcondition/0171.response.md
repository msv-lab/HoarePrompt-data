Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a list containing '0', `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2, and the bit at position `i` (which is 0) in `x` is 0.** 

The list `s` now contains the string '0' as its first element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
