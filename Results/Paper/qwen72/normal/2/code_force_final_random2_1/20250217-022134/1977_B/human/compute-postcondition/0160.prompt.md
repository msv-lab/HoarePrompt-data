Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1', and `length` remains 30. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, then `length` is 30, and `s` has 30 elements. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been left unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1', and `length` remains 30. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, then `length` is 30, and `s` has 30 elements. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been left unchanged. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the value of `s[i - 1]` is now '-1', and the value of `s[i]` is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1', and `length` remains 30. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, then `length` is 30, and `s` has 30 elements. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been left unchanged. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[1]` is now '-1', and `s[2]` is '0'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1', and `length` remains 30. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, then `length` is 30, and `s` has 30 elements. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been left unchanged. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[1]` is now '-1', and `s[2]` is '0'. If `s[3]` is '-1' and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[2]` is now '-1', and `s[3]` is '0'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
