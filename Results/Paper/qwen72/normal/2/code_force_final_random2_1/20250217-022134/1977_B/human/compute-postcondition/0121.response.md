The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `'-1'`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `x` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `t` is greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `nalla` is 1 (unchanged).
- `length` is 30 (unchanged).
- `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 in `s` will be changed to `'-1'`.
- `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` is either '1' or '0'.
- `flag` is either 0 or 1, but its value does not affect the execution of the given code snippet.

Since `i` is 1, the element at index 1 in `s` will be set to `'-1'`. The rest of the list `s` remains unchanged. The value of `flag` remains the same as it was before the code execution.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, where `s[1]` is now `'-1'` and all other elements remain either '1' or '0', `flag` remains the same as before.**
