Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` is either '1' or '0', representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and each power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^29, and `flag` is 0. If `flag` is 0 (which it always is according to the precondition), the condition `s[i] == '0'` is not evaluated, and thus the state of the program remains unchanged.***
