Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29), `s[2]` is '-1', `flag` is 1, `s[1]` is '0', `s[0]` is '0'.**

Explanation:
- `flag` is set to 1.
- Since `flag` is now 1 and `s[2]` is '-1' (not '0'), the condition for setting `s[1]` to '0' is not met.
- However, since `flag` is 1, the second condition (if `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1') is not checked.
- The final condition checks if `s[1]` is '0'. Since `s[1]` is '0', `s[0]` is set to '0'.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
