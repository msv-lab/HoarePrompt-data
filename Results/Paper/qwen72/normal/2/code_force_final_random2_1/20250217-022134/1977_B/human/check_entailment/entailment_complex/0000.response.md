Reasoning:  
The program aims to convert a given integer `x` into a special binary representation using the digits 1, 0, and -1, adhering to the constraints specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**: The program initializes a list `s` with 30 elements, representing the binary form of `x` but using strings ('1' and '0'). This is done using bitwise operations to check each bit of `x`.

3. **Adjusting the Representation**:
   - The program uses a flag to handle consecutive 1s. If it encounters two consecutive 1s, it changes the first 1 to -1 and sets a flag to propagate the change.
   - The flag is used to adjust subsequent bits to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.
   - If the flag is set at the end of the 30-bit sequence, it adjusts the last bit or adds an extra bit to maintain the correct representation.

4. **Final Adjustments**: The program ensures that any `-1` followed by a `1` is adjusted to avoid consecutive non-zero bits.

5. **Output**: The program prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the list.

### Verification:
- **Constraints**: The program ensures that the length of the list is between 1 and 32, and each element is either 1, 0, or -1.
- **No Consecutive Non-Zero Bits**: The program correctly handles the propagation of `-1` to avoid consecutive non-zero bits.
- **Correct Sum**: The program correctly converts the integer `x` into the required format, ensuring that the sum of the modified binary representation equals `x`.

Given the above points, the program appears to meet all the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
