Postcondition: **`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The `flag` is 1, indicating that the last condition met during the loop execution was such that any consecutive '1's in `s` were replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 were left unchanged. Additionally, `s[29]` is not '0'.**
