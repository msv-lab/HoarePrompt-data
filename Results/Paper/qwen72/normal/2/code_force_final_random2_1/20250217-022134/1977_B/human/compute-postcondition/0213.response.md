Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1', `flag` is 1, `s[1]` is '0', `s[2]` is '-1', and `s[0]` remains as '0' or '1' based on the binary representation of `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `flag` is set to 1.
- Since `flag` is 1, `s[1]` is set to '0' and `flag` remains 1.
- The value of `s[2]` is updated to '-1'.
- The values of `i` and `s[0]` remain unchanged.
- The rest of the list `s` remains unchanged.
