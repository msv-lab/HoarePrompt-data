Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements. Each element in `s` corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). If a bit in `x` is set (i.e., 1), the corresponding element in `s` is '1'. If a bit in `x` is not set (i.e., 0), the corresponding element in `s` is '0'.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 30 iterations, the variable `i` will be 29, and the list `s` will contain 30 elements. Each element in `s` represents whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set (1) or not set (0). The first element in `s` corresponds to the least significant bit (bit at position 0), and the last element in `s` corresponds to the most significant bit (bit at position 29).
