Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements. Each element in `s` is either '1' or '0', representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and each power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^29. If the corresponding bit in `x` is set (1), the element is '1'; otherwise, it is '0'.**
