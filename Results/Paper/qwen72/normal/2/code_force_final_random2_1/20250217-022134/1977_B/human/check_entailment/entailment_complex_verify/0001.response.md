### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The function converts the integer `x` into a 30-bit binary representation. This is appropriate because \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\), ensuring that 30 bits are sufficient to represent any valid `x`.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**:
   - The function uses a flag to handle the constraint that no two consecutive non-zero elements should exist.
   - It iterates through the binary representation and adjusts the values to ensure that if two consecutive '1's are found, the first one is changed to '-1' and a carry is set.
   - If a carry is set and the next bit is '0', it is changed to '1' and the carry is reset.
   - If the carry reaches the last bit, it is handled appropriately by either setting the last bit to '1' or appending an additional '1' to the list.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the initial adjustments, the function makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by adjusting any remaining '-1' followed by '1' to '0' and '-1'.
   - This step is crucial to meet the requirement that there should not be two consecutive non-zero elements.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Initial Binary Conversion**:
  ```python
  for i in range(30):
      if x & pow(2, i):
          s.append('1')
      else:
          s.append('0')
  ```
  This correctly converts `x` into a 30-bit binary representation.

- **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
  ```python
  flag = 0
  for i in range(0, 29):
      if flag and s[i] == '0':
          s[i] = '1'
          flag = 0
      if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
          s[i] = '-1'
          flag = 1
      elif flag == 1:
          s[i] = '0'
      else:
          pass
  ```
  This loop ensures that no two consecutive '1's exist by converting the first '1' to '-1' and setting a carry (`flag`).

- **Handling the Last Bit**:
  ```python
  if flag and s[29] == '0':
      s[29] = '1'
  elif flag:
      s[29] = '0'
      s.append('1')
      length += 1
  ```
  This handles the carry when it reaches the last bit, either by setting the last bit to '1' or appending an additional '1' to the list.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, length):
      if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
          s[i] = '0'
          s[i - 1] = '-1'
  ```
  This ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by adjusting any remaining '-1' followed by '1' to '0' and '-1'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the required output. The logic and steps are sound, and the annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected.
