The code snippet `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `'0'`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 of `s` is set to `'0'`.

Let's analyze the impact on the initial state:

- `i` is 1 (unchanged).
- `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'.
- `s[1]` is now set to `'0'`.
- The condition about `flag` and `s[0]` does not affect the current operation since the code only modifies `s[1]`.
- `flag` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1, depending on its initial value).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1', `s[1]` is '0', `flag` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1).**
