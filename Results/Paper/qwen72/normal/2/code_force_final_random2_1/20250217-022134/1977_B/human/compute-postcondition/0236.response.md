Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `length` is greater than 2, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `s[1]` is '-1' and `s[0]` is '1', the first three elements of `s` are '1', '-1', and '-1' respectively, and the rest of the elements remain as they were. Otherwise, the first two elements of `s` are '1' and '-1' respectively, and the rest of the elements remain as they were. `flag` is 0, and `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.***
