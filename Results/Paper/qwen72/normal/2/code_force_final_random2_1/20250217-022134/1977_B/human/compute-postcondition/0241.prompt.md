Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The final state of `s` depends on the transitions defined within the loop. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i + 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '-1', and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is set to '0', and `flag` remains 1. Otherwise, `s[i]` remains unchanged. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1', and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0', then `s[29]` remains unchanged, and `flag` remains as it was. The variables `length`, `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `length` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `s[1]` is '-1' and `s[0]` is '1', the first two elements of `s` are '1' and '-1' respectively, and the rest of the elements remain as they were. `flag` is 0, and `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is greater than 2, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `s[1]` is '-1' and `s[0]` is '1', the first three elements of `s` are '1', '-1', and '-1' respectively, and the rest of the elements remain as they were. Otherwise, the first two elements of `s` are '1' and '-1' respectively, and the rest of the elements remain as they were. `flag` is 0, and `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `length` is greater than 3, `s` remains the same as described in the initial state, `flag` remains 0, and `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[3]` is '1', then `s[3]` is updated to '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
