Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`. If not, it should output a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the string `s` to determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are present.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and `alphabet` as a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in `s`:
     - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` has more than one element, `i` is removed from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` has exactly one element, `i` is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset to the original set.
   - After the loop, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and stores the result in `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - If `b` is `False`, it means not all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
     - It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s` by appending the missing character (if any) to `s2`.
   - If `b` is `True`, it appends "Yes" to the output list `OUT`.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - The use of `s1` and `s2` and the way `alphabet` is managed do not ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked.
   - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not sufficient to guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.

2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The logic to construct a missing subsequence is flawed. It assumes that the first missing character in `s1` can be used to form a missing subsequence, which is not always correct.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for checking subsequences and constructing a missing subsequence is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
