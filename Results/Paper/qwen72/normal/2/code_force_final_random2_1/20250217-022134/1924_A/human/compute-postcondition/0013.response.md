To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty.
- `i` is the first character of `s`.
- If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` (`i`).
- If the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s` (`i`).
- If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s` (`i`), and `alphabet` remains a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- The variable `i` is updated to the next character in `s` at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `s`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- The string `s` remains unchanged in the loop head, but `i` will be the next character in `s` at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State:**
   - `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty.
   - `i` is the first character of `s`.
   - `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` (`i`).
   - If the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s` (`i`).
   - If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s` (`i`), and `alphabet` remains a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be the second character of `s`.
   - The rest of the state remains the same, as the loop head does not modify `s`, `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty, `i` is the second character of `s`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, if the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `alphabet` remains a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
