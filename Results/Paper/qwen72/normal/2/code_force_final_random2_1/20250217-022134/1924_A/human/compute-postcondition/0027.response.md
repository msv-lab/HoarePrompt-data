Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty. `i` is the third character of `s`. `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is updated to contain the first character of `s` followed by the third character of `s`. If `len(alphabet)` is not 1, `i` has been removed from the set `alphabet`. If `len(alphabet)` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the third character of `s` appended to its previous value, and `alphabet` remains a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
