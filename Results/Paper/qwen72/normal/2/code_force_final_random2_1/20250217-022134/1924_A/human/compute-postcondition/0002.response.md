Output State: **s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; s1 is an empty string; s2 is an empty string; alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code creates a set named `alphabet` that contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, starting from 'a'. The values of `s`, `k`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. The new set `alphabet` is now part of the output state.
