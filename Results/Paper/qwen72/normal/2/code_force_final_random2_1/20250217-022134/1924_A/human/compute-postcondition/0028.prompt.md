Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; s1 is an empty string; s2 is an empty string; alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty. `i` is the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` (`i`). If the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s` (`i`). If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s` (`i`), and `alphabet` remains a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty. `i` is the second character of `s`. `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is updated to contain the first two characters of `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is updated to exclude the first and second characters of `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is updated to contain the first and second characters of `s`, and `alphabet` is updated to exclude the first and second characters of `s`. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty. `i` is the third character of `s`. `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is updated to contain the first character of `s` followed by the third character of `s`. If `len(alphabet)` is not 1, `i` has been removed from the set `alphabet`. If `len(alphabet)` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the third character of `s` appended to its previous value, and `alphabet` remains a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
