### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```
This function is responsible for updating the position of a player based on a movement direction. The function correctly takes the current position `a` and the movement direction `b`, and returns the new position after applying the movement.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the field dimensions, initializes the players and goals, and processes the movements. The key part of the program that needs to be evaluated is the scoring mechanism:

```python
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
print('FINAL SCORE', pointsr, pointsb)
```

The scoring logic is as follows:
- If a player is at a red goal (`goals['R']`), the blue team scores.
- If a player is at a blue goal (`goals['B']`), the red team scores.

However, the problem description specifies that if a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should get the point. The current implementation does not account for this scenario.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
B2 U
B2 U
B2 L
B2 C .Q
B2 L
B2 L
B2 T
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T
```

- At step 6, B2 scores in the red goal (RG). According to the problem, the blue team should get a point.
- At step 12, R0 scores in the blue goal (BG). According to the problem, the red team should get a point.

The current program will correctly print:
```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

However, the program fails to handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal, leading to incorrect scoring.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal, which leads to incorrect scoring. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
