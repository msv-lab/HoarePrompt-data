To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

4. **Consider the Given Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `a` is 0.
   - `b` is an empty string.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `j` will start at 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
