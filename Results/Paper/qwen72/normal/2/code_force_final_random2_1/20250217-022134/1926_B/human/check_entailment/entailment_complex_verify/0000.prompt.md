You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())

    #State: `t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is `t-1`; `n` is the last integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If any of the input strings `s` for any test case contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. If any of the input strings `s` for any test case contained more than one '1', `b` is 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by an `n x n` grid represented by `n` lines of `n` characters ('0' or '1'). The function determines whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the pattern of '1's. If any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', the function prints 'TRIANGLE'. If any row contains more than one '1', the function prints 'SQUARE'. If no row meets either condition, the function prints 'SQUARE'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that the input has been fully read and processed, and the appropriate shape (triangle or square) has been printed for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes in all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3
010
111
010
```

This input represents a triangle with `k=3`. However, the program will incorrectly identify this as a square because it checks only the count of '1's in each row without considering their positions. Specifically, the program will set `b = 'SQUARE'` because the second row has more than one '1', and it will print "SQUARE" instead of "TRIANGLE".

The program needs to consider the positions of the '1's in the grid to correctly identify the shape, not just the count of '1's in each row.
