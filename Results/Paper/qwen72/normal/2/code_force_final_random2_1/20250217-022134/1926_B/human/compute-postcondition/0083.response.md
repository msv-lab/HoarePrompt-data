The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `j` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; `j` is 2; `s` is a new string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
