The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `n` is an integer input by the user; `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE' and `a` remains 0. If `s` contains no '1', `b` remains an empty string and `a` remains 0. `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
