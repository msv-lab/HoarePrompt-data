Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user, with a range of 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `j` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `a` remains 0 because no input string `s` during the loop contained exactly one '1'.
- `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` during the loop contained more than one '1'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.

Given these conditions, the `print(b)` statement will print the value of `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1', and remains an empty string otherwise, the output will depend on whether any input string `s` contained more than one '1'.

However, the initial state does not specify whether any input string `s` contained more than one '1'. Therefore, we must consider both possibilities:

1. If any input string `s` contained more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'.
2. If no input string `s` contained more than one '1', then `b` is an empty string.

Since the initial state does not provide enough information to determine which of these cases occurred, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **b (where b is either 'SQUARE' if any input string s contained more than one '1', or an empty string if no input string s contained more than one '1')**
