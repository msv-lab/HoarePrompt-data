To determine what will be printed by the `print(b)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `j` is initialized to `n-1`.
   - `a` is initialized to 0.
   - `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character; otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.

2. **Key Variable: `b`**
   - The value of `b` depends on the input strings `s`.
   - If any of the input strings `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` will be set to 'SQUARE'.
   - Otherwise, `b` will remain an empty string.

Given this information, the `print(b)` statement will print either 'SQUARE' or an empty string, depending on the content of the input strings `s`.

**Output:**
- If any of the input strings `s` contains more than one '1' character, the output will be:
  Output: **SQUARE**
- Otherwise, the output will be:
  Output: **(empty string)**

This is the most precise description based on the given precondition.
