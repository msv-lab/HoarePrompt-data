Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `n` is an integer input by the user; `a` is 0; `b` is an empty string or 'SQUARE'; `s` is a string input by the user. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string. The count of '1' in `s` is not equal to 1.***
