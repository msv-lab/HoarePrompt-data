Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is a new integer input by the user.
- `j` is set to `n-1`.
- `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' because the input string `s` contained exactly one '1'.
- `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`.

Given that `a` is explicitly set to 'TRIANGLE' because the input string `s` contained exactly one '1', the value of `a` is known and fixed.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
