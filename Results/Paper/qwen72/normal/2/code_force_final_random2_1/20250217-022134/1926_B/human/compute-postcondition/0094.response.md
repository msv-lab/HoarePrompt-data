Postcondition: ***`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it means the input string `s` contained exactly one '1'. If `a` is 0, it means the input string `s` did not contain exactly one '1'. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.***
