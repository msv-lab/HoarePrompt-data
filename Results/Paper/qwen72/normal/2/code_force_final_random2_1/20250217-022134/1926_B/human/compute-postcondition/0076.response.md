Postcondition: ***`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `j` is 0; `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. Otherwise, `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is more than 1, or `b` remains an empty string if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is 0.***
