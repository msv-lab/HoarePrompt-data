Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes in all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3
010
111
010
```

This input represents a triangle with `k=3`. However, the program will incorrectly identify this as a square because it checks only the count of '1's in each row without considering their positions. Specifically, the program will set `b = 'SQUARE'` because the second row has more than one '1', and it will print "SQUARE" instead of "TRIANGLE".

The program needs to consider the positions of the '1's in the grid to correctly identify the shape, not just the count of '1's in each row.
