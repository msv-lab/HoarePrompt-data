Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by an `n x n` grid represented by `n` lines of `n` characters ('0' or '1'). The function determines whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the pattern of '1's. If any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', the function prints 'TRIANGLE'. If any row contains more than one '1', the function prints 'SQUARE'. If no row meets either condition, the function prints 'SQUARE'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that the input has been fully read and processed, and the appropriate shape (triangle or square) has been printed for each test case. **
