Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `n` is an integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If any input string `s` during the loop contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any input string `s` during the loop contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0. If no input string `s` contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `j` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `a` will be set to 'TRIANGLE' if any input string `s` during the loop contained exactly one '1'.
- The variable `b` will be set to 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` during the loop contained more than one '1'.
- If no input string `s` contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0.
- If no input string `s` contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.
