Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `n` is an integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If at least one input string `s` during the loop contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. If any input string `s` during the loop contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.***
