Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is a new integer input by the user.
- `j` is set to `n - 1`.
- `a` is set to 0.
- `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contains more than one '1'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `b` is determined based on the input string `s`.
- If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
- If `s` does not contain more than one '1', then `b` remains an empty string.

### Output:
The `print(b)` statement will print the value of `b` based on the conditions described above.

- If the input string `s` contains more than one '1', the output will be:
  Output: **SQUARE**

- If the input string `s` does not contain more than one '1', the output will be:
  Output: **'' (an empty string)**

Since the exact input string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact output without knowing `s`. However, based on the given conditions, the output will be either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.

Output: **b (where b is 'SQUARE' if the input string s contains more than one '1', otherwise b is an empty string)**
