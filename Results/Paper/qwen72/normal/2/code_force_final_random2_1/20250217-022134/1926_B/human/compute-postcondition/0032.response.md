The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer input by the user with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `n` is an integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If at least one input string `s` during the loop contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. If any input string `s` during the loop contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.**
