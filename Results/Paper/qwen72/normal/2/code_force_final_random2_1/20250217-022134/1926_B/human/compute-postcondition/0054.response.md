Output State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` remains 1; `n` must be greater than 2; `j` is 2; `a` remains 0; `b` is set to 'SQUARE'; `s` is now the new string input by the user.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `b` to 'SQUARE'. This change affects the value of `b` regardless of the initial conditions. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged, and the value of `a` also remains 0 as specified in the initial state.
