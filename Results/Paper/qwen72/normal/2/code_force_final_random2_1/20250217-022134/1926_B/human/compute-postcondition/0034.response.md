Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `n` is an integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 0; `b` is an empty string.**

The code snippet `a = 0` does not change the value of `a` because `a` was already initialized to 0 in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
