Output State: **`t` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x_a + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b], `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`. If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, `a` is `y1 - 1`. If `y2` is less than `y1`, `a` is `m - y1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x2` is updated to `r[4] - a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The conditions specified in the initial state are still valid, except for the value of `x2` which is now `r[4] - a`.
