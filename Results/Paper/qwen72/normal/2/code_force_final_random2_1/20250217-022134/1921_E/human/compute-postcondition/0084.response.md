Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a single test case involving a game played on a rectangular board. It takes no explicit parameters but reads input from the standard input, expecting six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, which represent the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. The function determines the outcome of the game based on the positions of the chips and prints one of three possible results: 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'draw'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values are consumed, and the program state reflects the printed result of the game. **
