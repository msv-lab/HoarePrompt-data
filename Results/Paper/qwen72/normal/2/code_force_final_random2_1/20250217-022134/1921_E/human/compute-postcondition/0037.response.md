Output State: **`t` is `abs(1 - y1)`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + (r[5] - 1)`, `x2` is `r[4] - (r[5] - 1)`, `y2` is 1, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is `y1 - (r[5] - 1)`, `a` is `r[5] - 1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 ≥ 1`, and `x2 ≤ n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y1` is updated to `y1 - (r[5] - 1)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
