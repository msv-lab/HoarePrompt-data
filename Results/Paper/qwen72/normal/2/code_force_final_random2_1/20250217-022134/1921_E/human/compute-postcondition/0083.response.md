The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each containing six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. These represent the dimensions of a board (`h` for height, `w` for width) and the initial positions of two chips (Alice's chip at `(x_a, y_a)` and Bob's chip at `(x_b, y_b)`). The function processes these test cases but does not return any value explicitly. Instead, it likely performs some operations or prints results based on the input data.
