Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `x_a + a`.
- `y1` is either 1 or `m`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is either `r[5] - a` or `r[5] + a`.
- `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
- Additionally, one of the following conditions must be true:
  - `b // 2 <= a`
  - `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
  - `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`
  - `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`

Given the `print('draw')` statement, the output is simply the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
