Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, x, and y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = {}
    beautiful_count = 0
    print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        print(
            f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
            )
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the loop, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can form a "beautiful" pair with any previous number in `a` based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each key in `freq` is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)`, and its value is the number of times this pair has been encountered. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are the results of the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']` with all its elements processed, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each element in `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count`, the second being the final value of `beautiful_count` before the last append, and the third being the final value of `beautiful_count` after the last append, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have `n` elements, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the remainders when an element of `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and the value is the count of how many times this pair of remainders appears in `a`. The variable `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
