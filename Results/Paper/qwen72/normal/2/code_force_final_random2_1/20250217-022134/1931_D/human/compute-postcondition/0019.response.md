The code snippet `freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0` initializes the entry `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` with the value `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
- Each test case contains two lines: the first line with three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
- The tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in the dictionary `freq`.

After executing the code snippet, the dictionary `freq` now contains the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with the value `0`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` set to `0`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
