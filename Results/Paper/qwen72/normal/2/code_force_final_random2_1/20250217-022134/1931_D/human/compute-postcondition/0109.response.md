Postcondition: ***`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq` has the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` set to 0, and `beautiful_count` remains 0. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` is updated to `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.***
