To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements: the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the final value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least one more element.
   - `freq` is a dictionary.
   - `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `num`: The next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: The value `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y`: The value `mod_y`.

Given these definitions, let's determine the values:

- `num` is the next element in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers, `num` will be one of those integers.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y`.

Let's assume the following example values for clarity:
- `a = [10, 15, 20, 25]`
- `x = 3`
- `y = 4`

For the first element in `a` (which is `10`):
- `num = 10`
- `mod_x = 10 % 3 = 1`
- `mod_y = 10 % 4 = 2`
- `required_mod_x = (3 - 1) % 3 = 2`
- `required_mod_y = 2`

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **Number: 10, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 2, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 2**
