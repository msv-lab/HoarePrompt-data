The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute, but they should remain as stated.

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element, and `num` should be the first element of `a`.

State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count` (which is 0), `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are undefined**
