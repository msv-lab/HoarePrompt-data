Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `beautiful_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not in `freq`, then `freq` now has the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` set to 1. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` was already in `freq`, then `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1. `beautiful_count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least two elements, `freq` is a dictionary. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not in `freq`, then `freq` now has the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` set to 1. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` was already in `freq`, then `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least one more element, `freq` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not in `freq`, it is now set to 1. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
