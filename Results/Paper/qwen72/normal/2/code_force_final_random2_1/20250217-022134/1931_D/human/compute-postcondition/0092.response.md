The only object in the loop head is the variable `case` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `test_cases`. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has `t` test cases, and `case` was the last test case in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another test case in `test_cases`.

Since the loop has already executed all iterations, the next state would be the state just before the loop starts, where `case` is the first test case in `test_cases` and `test_cases` still contains all `t` test cases.

State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` with no elements processed yet, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0**
