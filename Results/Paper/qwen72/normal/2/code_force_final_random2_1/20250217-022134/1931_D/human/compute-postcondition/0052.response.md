Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count` (which is 0), `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is now the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are undefined.** 

Explanation: The code initializes `beautiful_count` to 0, which is then stored in the `results` list. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`) retain their initial values, and `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain undefined as they are not assigned any values in the given code snippet.
