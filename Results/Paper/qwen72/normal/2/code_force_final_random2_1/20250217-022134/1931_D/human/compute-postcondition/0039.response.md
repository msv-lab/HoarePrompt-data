To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **`mod_x`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
2. **`mod_y`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
3. **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]`**: This is incremented by 1, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
4. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
5. **`required_mod_y`**: This is simply `mod_y`.

Given these definitions, let's construct the output step by step:

- **`Number: {num}`**: This will print the value of `num`.
- **`mod_x: {mod_x}`**: This will print the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
- **`mod_y: {mod_y}`**: This will print the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- **`required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}`**: This will print the value of \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
- **`required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}`**: This will print the value of `mod_y`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]**

Where:
- `[num]` is the value of `num`.
- `[mod_x]` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
- `[mod_y]` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- `[(x - mod_x) % x]` is the value of \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
- `[mod_y]` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y` (repeated for `required_mod_y`).
