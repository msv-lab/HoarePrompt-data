To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `num` and the list `a`.

### Analysis:
- The loop `for num in a:` will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the list `a` must contain at least one element.

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least one element.
- The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in `a` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
- `a` must have at least one element.
- `num` is the first element in `a`.

### State:
**`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `beautiful_count` and the second being the final value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element in `a`**
