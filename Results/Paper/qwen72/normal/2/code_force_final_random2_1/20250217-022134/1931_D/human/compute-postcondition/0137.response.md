Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Each element in `results` represents the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the `freq` dictionary for each test case. The `freq` dictionary contains counts of how many times each pair of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` appears in the list `a` for each test case.**
