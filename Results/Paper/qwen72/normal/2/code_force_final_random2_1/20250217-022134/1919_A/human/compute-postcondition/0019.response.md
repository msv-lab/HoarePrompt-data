The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it should accept three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

The function's output is not specified in the provided context, so I will assume it returns some form of result for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` represents the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `a` and `b` represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.**
