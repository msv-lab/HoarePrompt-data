The code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the absolute difference between `a` and `b` being even or odd is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` and `b` are now specific integers provided by the user input (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is true. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the condition is false.**
