Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from user input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, the function prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, either "Bob" or "Alice" has been printed based on the condition described. **
