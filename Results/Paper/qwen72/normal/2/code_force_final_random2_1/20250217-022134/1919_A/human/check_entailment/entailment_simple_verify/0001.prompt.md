You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a and b are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` is an integer provided by the user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` and `b` are specific integers provided by the user input (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), and `i` is `t-1`. The loop has printed "Bob" for each pair of `a` and `b` where the absolute difference between them is even, and "Alice" for each pair where the absolute difference is odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement and the expected outcomes.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to determining the winner lies in the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

### Solution Logic:
- The provided solution uses the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` to determine the winner.
- This condition checks if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even.

### Reasoning for the Condition:
- If the difference `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob will win.
- If the difference `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice will win.

### Explanation:
- **Even Difference**: If the difference is even, the number of moves required to reach a state where one player cannot make a move will be even. Since Alice starts, she will make the first move, and Bob will make the last move, leading to Bob's win.
- **Odd Difference**: If the difference is odd, the number of moves required to reach a state where one player cannot make a move will be odd. Since Alice starts, she will make the last move, leading to Alice's win.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even)
  - Expected output: Bob
  - Actual output: Bob
- **Example 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
  - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd)
  - Expected output: Alice
  - Actual output: Alice
- **Example 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
  - `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even)
  - Expected output: Bob
  - Actual output: Bob
- **Example 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd)
  - Expected output: Alice
  - Actual output: Alice

All examples match the expected outcomes, confirming that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
