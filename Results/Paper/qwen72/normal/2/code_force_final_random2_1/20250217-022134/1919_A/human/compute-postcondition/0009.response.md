The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer provided by the user input within the range 1 to 1000, and `i` is 1. The condition about the absolute difference between `a` and `b` being even or odd is not directly affected by this code snippet, but the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is true. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the condition is false.**
