Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Costs**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city using a formula involving powers (`v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`). This is incorrect because the cost to travel to the closest city should always be 1 coin, not a value derived from the distances.

2. **Handling of Queries**:
   - The program uses a list `b` to store cumulative costs, but the way it calculates these costs is flawed. The correct approach should involve precomputing the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city and then using this information to handle queries efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, it assumes that the closest city can always be determined by the given logic, which may not hold true for all inputs.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a lambda function `r` to read input, which is not a common or clear way to handle input in Python. This makes the code harder to understand and debug.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program's current logic will produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above. Specifically, the calculation of the cumulative costs in the list `b` is incorrect, leading to wrong answers for the queries.
