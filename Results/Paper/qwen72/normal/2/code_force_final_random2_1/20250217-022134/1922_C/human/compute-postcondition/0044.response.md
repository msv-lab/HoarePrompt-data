Output State: **`b` is a list with the initial elements `[0, 0]`, `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the second element is `c`, the third element is `d`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `u` is 0 (falsy), `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the condition `c >= d` holds true.**
