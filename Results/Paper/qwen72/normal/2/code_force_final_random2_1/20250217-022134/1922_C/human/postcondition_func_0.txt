The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cities positioned on a number line and a series of queries about the distances between certain pairs of cities. For each test case, it reads the number of cities and their positions, then calculates a list of cumulative distances between adjacent city pairs. It then reads the number of queries and the queries themselves, and for each query, it prints the distance between the specified cities based on the precomputed cumulative distances. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function concludes with the state where `t` is 0, `u` is 0, and the lists `a` and `b` contain the processed city positions and cumulative distances, respectively.
