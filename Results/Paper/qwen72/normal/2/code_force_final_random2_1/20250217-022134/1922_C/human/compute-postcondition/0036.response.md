To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^9\).
4. `m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
5. `b` is a list with length `n-3` appended to the initial `[0, 0]`. Each element in `b` from index 2 onwards is calculated as `b[i] = b[i-2] + (y - x)`.
6. `u` is a truthy value (greater than 0) decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0.
7. `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the condition `c >= d` holds true.

### Analysis:
1. **List `b` Construction**:
   - `b` starts with `[0, 0]`.
   - For each subsequent element starting from index 2, `b[i]` is calculated as `b[i-2] + (y - x)`.
   - This means `b` is constructed such that every second element is the sum of the previous second element plus `(y - x)`.

2. **Indices Calculation**:
   - The `print` statement uses indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - These indices are used to access elements in the list `b`.

3. **Condition on `c` and `d`**:
   - If `c < d`, then `(d - 1) * 2` will be greater than `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - If `c >= d`, then `(d - 1) * 2` will be less than or equal to `(c - 1) * 2`.

4. **Value Calculation**:
   - The expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` calculates the difference between the elements at these indices in the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Given the construction of `b` and the indices used, the value of `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` will be a multiple of `(y - x)`.

- If `c < d`, the difference will be positive.
- If `c >= d`, the difference will be non-positive.

However, without specific values for `c` and `d`, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of `b` and the relationship between `c` and `d`.

Output: **(d - c) * (y - x) (where (d - c) is the difference between d and c, and (y - x) is the constant difference used in constructing the list b)**.
