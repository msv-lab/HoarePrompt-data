To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
- `b` is a list `[0, 0]`
- `n` must be at least 4
- `v` is equal to `y - x`

### Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values of `b`:**
   - `b` starts as `[0, 0]`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b[-2]` refers to the second-to-last element of `b`, which is `0`.
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `0`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise `1` (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `1`.

3. **Calculating New Elements:**
   - First new element: `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w) = 0 + v ** (v > x - w)`
     - If `v > x - w` is `True`, this becomes `v`.
     - If `v > x - w` is `False`, this becomes `1`.
   - Second new element: `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y) = 0 + v ** (v > z - y)`
     - If `v > z - y` is `True`, this becomes `v`.
     - If `v > z - y` is `False`, this becomes `1`.

4. **Updating `b`:**
   - `b` will be extended by the two new elements calculated above.

### Output State:
- `b` will be updated to `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is now `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`, `n` must be at least 4, `v` is equal to `y - x`.**
