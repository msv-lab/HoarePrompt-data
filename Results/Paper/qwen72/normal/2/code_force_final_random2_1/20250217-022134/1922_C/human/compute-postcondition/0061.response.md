To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` has `n` elements.
   - The first element is `-1000000000.0`.
   - The second element is `c`.
   - The third element is `d`.
   - The remaining elements up to the last element are `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - The list `b` has grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - These variables are set to the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - `u` is then decremented by 1 (`u = u - 1`), and this must evaluate to a truthy value.

4. **Condition**:
   - `c` is less than `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is structured as follows: `[-1000000000.0, c, d, ..., 2000000000.0]`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - The list `b` has grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements. This means that if `n` is the total number of elements in `a`, then `b` has `2 * (n - 3)` additional elements.
   - Since `b` grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements, it suggests that `b` might be a list that is derived from `a` in some way, possibly by doubling the number of elements between certain indices.

3. **Indices in List `b`**:
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` calculates the index in `b` based on the value of `d`.
   - Similarly, `(c - 1) * 2` calculates the index in `b` based on the value of `c`.

4. **Subtraction**:
   - The `print` statement subtracts the value at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the value at index `(d - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

### Determining the Values:
- Since `c` is less than `d`, `(c - 1) * 2` will be a smaller index than `(d - 1) * 2`.
- The exact values at these indices in `b` depend on how `b` is constructed from `a`. However, without the specific construction details of `b`, we can only describe the result in terms of the indices.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions and the structure of the lists, the `print` statement will output the difference between the values at the specified indices in `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]** (where `b` is the list that has grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements, and `c` and `d` are elements from the list `a` with `c < d`).
