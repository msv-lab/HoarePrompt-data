To determine what will be printed by the `print(b, 'B')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

### Initial State:
- The list `a` has `n` elements.
- The first element of `a` is `-1000000000.0`.
- The second element of `a` is `c`.
- The third element of `a` is `d`.
- The remaining elements of `a` are unspecified but end with `2000000000.0`.
- The list `b` will grow by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.
- Each pair of new elements added to `b` is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and whether these differences satisfy certain conditions.
- The variables `t`, `m`, `u`, and the function `r()` remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - The first element is `-1000000000.0`.
   - The second element is `c`.
   - The third element is `d`.
   - The last element is `2000000000.0`.
   - The intermediate elements between `d` and `2000000000.0` are unspecified but must be present to make the total length `n`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - The list `b` grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.
   - Each pair of new elements added to `b` is based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and certain conditions.

### Calculation of New Elements in `b`:
- For each pair of consecutive elements in `a` (starting from the second element), a difference is calculated.
- If the difference satisfies certain conditions, two new elements are added to `b`.

### Example Calculation:
- Let's assume `n = 5` for simplicity.
- The list `a` would look like: `[-1000000000.0, c, d, e, 2000000000.0]`.
- The list `b` will grow by `2 * (5 - 3) = 4` elements.
- The differences are:
  - `c - (-1000000000.0) = c + 1000000000.0`
  - `d - c`
  - `e - d`
  - `2000000000.0 - e`

- Depending on the conditions, four new elements will be added to `b`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and `e` are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **[list of 4 elements based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions applied], 'B'**

This means that the `print` statement will output a list `b` containing 4 elements, which are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions applied, followed by the string `'B'`.
