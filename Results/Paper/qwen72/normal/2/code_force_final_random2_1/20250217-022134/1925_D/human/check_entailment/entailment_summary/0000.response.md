Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for the excursions, given the constraints and the problem description. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly sums up the initial friendship values `sum_f` for all pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children, which is `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the initial friendship values and the increase in friendship values over the excursions.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Operation**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result, which is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no friends (`m = 0`) correctly, as it will output `0` because `sum_f` will be `0`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The combinatorial and expected value calculations are consistent with the problem statement, and the modular arithmetic is handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
