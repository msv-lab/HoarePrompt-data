The code snippet updates the value of `q` to `2 * cn2 ** 2`. Let's break down the impact:

- `cn2` is defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- The new value of `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the first input integer
- `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0
- `k` is the third input integer
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop
- `j` is `m`
- `a` is the last input integer from the loop
- `b` is the last input integer from the loop
- `f` is the last input integer from the loop
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q` was initially `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

After executing the code snippet:
- `q` is now `2 * cn2 ** 2`, which simplifies to `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m`, `a` is the last input integer from the loop, `b` is the last input integer from the loop, `f` is the last input integer from the loop, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
