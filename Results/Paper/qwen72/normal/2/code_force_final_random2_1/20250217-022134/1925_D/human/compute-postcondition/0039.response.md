The value of `p` is updated to `p // gcd`. This means `p` is now the integer division of the original `p` by the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `p` and `q`.

Let's break down the initial state and the changes:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (unchanged)
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `m` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `k` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `sum_f` is `m * f` (unchanged)
- `j` is `m - 1` (unchanged)
- `a` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `b` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `f` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2` (unchanged)
- `p` was `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)` (unchanged)
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` (unchanged)

After the code execution:
- `p` is now `p // gcd`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `m * f`, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
