Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided solution does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the formula used to compute `p` and `q` is incorrect. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and the increase in friendship value.
   - The current formula `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` does not correctly represent the expected value calculation.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each excursion, the expected value of the friendship value of the chosen pair can be calculated as follows:
     - The probability of choosing a friend pair is `m / cn2`.
     - The expected increase in friendship value for a friend pair is `1` (since it increases by 1 each time it is chosen).
     - The expected value of the friendship value for a friend pair at the start is `f_i`.
     - The expected value of the friendship value for a friend pair after `k` excursions is `f_i + k * (m / cn2)`.
   - The total expected value for all excursions is the sum of these expected values for each excursion.

3. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = k \times \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}}{\binom{n}{2}} \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = k \times \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i}{\binom{n}{2}} + \frac{k \times m}{\binom{n}{2}^2} \right)
     \]

4. **Modular Inverse**:
   - The modular inverse of `q` should be computed correctly using the `pow` function with the third argument as `M`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        expected_value = (k * (sum_f + k * m) * pow(cn2, -1, M)) % M
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This corrected version should now correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
