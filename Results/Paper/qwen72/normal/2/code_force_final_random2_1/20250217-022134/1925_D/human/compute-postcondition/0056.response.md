The code snippet `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the current value of `f` to it. Given that `sum_f` was initially `f + f`, after executing this line, `sum_f` becomes `f + f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `3 * f`, `j` is `m + 1`, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `f` is the third integer input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * 0 + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
