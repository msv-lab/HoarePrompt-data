t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively. Each of the m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
