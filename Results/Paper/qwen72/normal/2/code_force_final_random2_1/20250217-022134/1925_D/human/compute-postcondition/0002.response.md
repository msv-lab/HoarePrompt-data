To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should start from 0, as this is the typical starting point for a `range(t)` loop in Python.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4

We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` should be set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
