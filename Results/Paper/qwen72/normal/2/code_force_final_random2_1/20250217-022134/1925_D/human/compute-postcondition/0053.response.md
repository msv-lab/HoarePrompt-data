Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `j` is `m`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * 0 + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation: The value of `sum_f` is updated to `f + f` because the code snippet `sum_f += f` adds the value of `f` to the existing value of `sum_f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
