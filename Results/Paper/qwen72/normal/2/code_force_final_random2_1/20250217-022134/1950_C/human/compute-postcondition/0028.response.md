Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is set to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.***
