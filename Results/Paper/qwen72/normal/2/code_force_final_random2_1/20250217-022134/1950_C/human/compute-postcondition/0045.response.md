Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of times it will process a time input. For each iteration, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm", converts the hour to a 12-hour format, and appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. It then prints the converted time along with 'AM' or 'PM'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the initial state of `t` or `s`. After the function completes, `n` iterations have been processed, and the final state includes the printed times and the corresponding AM/PM indicators. **
