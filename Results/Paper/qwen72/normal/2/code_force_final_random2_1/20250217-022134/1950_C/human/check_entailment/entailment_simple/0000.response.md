Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all specified cases. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually. The logic within the loop correctly adjusts the hour and sets the AM/PM indicator based on the hour value:

- When the hour is 0, it converts to 12 AM.
- When the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the time to PM.
- When the hour is 12, it sets the time to PM.
- For all other hours, it keeps the hour as is and sets the time to AM.

The program also formats the output correctly, ensuring that hours and minutes are always two digits. This matches the requirements of the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
