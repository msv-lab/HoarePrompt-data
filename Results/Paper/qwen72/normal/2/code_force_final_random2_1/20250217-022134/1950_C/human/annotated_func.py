#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is an integer equal to the number of iterations completed, `_` is `n - 1`, `m` is the minute part of the last input as an integer. If the hour part of the last input (`h`) is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is set to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'AM'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of times it will process a time input. For each iteration, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm", converts the hour to a 12-hour format, and appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. It then prints the converted time along with 'AM' or 'PM'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the initial state of `t` or `s`. After the function completes, `n` iterations have been processed, and the final state includes the printed times and the corresponding AM/PM indicators.
