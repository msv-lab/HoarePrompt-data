The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12. If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM', and `h` is set to `h - 12`. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.**
