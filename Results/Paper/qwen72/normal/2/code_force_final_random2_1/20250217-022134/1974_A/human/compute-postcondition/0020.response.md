Postcondition: ***`t` is initially `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. After the if-else block, `t` is updated as follows: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`; otherwise, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. `x` and `y` remain integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. `n` remains greater than 0. `i` remains 0. `a` remains an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer). `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`. `t2` remains `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.***
