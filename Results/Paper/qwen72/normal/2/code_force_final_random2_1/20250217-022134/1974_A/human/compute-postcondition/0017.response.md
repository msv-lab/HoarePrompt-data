Output State: **`t` is `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, plus `t2 // 15`; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer); `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t1` is less than `a`; `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t2` is a multiple of 15.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` to its original value.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
