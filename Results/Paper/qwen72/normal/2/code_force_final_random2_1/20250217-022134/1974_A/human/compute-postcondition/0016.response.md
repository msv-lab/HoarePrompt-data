Postcondition: **`t` is `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer), `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t2` is a multiple of 15.**
