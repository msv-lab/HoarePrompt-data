Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**. 

In natural language, the initial state remains unchanged except for the new variable `t2`, which is calculated as the difference between `a` and the value of `t1`. The value of `t1` itself is derived from the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t` is determined based on whether `b` is even or odd.
