Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the loop has processed `n` pairs of inputs (`a`, `b`). For each iteration, the variable `t` is updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, for each pair of inputs (`a`, `b`), `t` is initially set to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. Then, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or `t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`, where `t2` is `a - t1`. The final value of `t` for each iteration is printed. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `n` is the total number of iterations performed.**
