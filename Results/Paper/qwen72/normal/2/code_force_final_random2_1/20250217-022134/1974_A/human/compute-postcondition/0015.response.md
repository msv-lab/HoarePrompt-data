Output State: **`t` is `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer), `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t2` is assigned the value `a - t1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `t1`) retain their initial values.
- The condition that `t1` is less than `a` remains valid.
- The value of `t2` is now specifically `a - t1`.
