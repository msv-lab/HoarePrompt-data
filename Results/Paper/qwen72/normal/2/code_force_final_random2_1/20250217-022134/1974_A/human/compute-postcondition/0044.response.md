Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is equal to `b // 2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be the integer division of `b` by 2, which means `t` is now `b // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
