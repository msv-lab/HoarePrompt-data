Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is zero correctly. Specifically, when `b` is 0, the initial calculation of `t` (number of screens) is set to 0, which is incorrect because even if there are no 2x2 icons, the 1x1 icons still need to be placed on screens. For example, if the input is `15 0`, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of screens as 1 instead of the correct value of 1.

To fix this, the initial value of `t` should be set to 1 if `b` is 0, and the logic for calculating the number of screens should be adjusted accordingly.
