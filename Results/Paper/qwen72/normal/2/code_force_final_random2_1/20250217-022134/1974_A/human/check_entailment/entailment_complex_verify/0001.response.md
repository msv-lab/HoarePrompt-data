### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), the program divides the total number of 2x2 icons by 2 to get the initial number of screens (`t`). If the number of 2x2 icons is odd, it adds 1 to ensure all icons fit.
   - The logic for this calculation is correct. The expression `t = (b + 1) // 2` is indeed a more concise way to handle both even and odd values of `b`, but the current implementation is also correct.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done by multiplying the number of screens by 15 and subtracting the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons (`t * 15 - b * 4`).
   - This calculation is correct and ensures that the remaining cells are accurately determined.

4. **Check if Remaining Cells Fit 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), the program does not change the number of screens (`t`).
   - If the remaining cells are insufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by dividing the number of remaining 1x1 icons by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder.
   - This logic is correct and ensures that the program correctly accounts for the additional screens needed.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output for the given problem description.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the initial number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and checking if they can fit the 1x1 icons is also correct.
- The logic for calculating additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work for the given problem description. The initial screen calculation can be simplified for clarity, but the current implementation is still correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
