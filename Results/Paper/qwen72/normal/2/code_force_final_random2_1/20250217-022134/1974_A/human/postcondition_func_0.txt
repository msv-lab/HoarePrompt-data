The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints a value `t` for each test case. The value of `t` is determined based on the following logic: `t` is initially set to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. Then, a value `t1` is computed as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is incremented by the ceiling of `(a - t1) / 15`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated `t` for each test case. After processing all `n` test cases, the function completes its execution.
