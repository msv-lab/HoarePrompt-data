To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `t1` and `t2` are initially undefined but will be set based on the conditions provided.

### Conditions:
1. If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
2. Otherwise, if `t2 % 15 == 0`:
   - If `b` is even, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + 1 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.
   - `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
3. If `t2 % 15 != 0`:
   - If `b` is even, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4` using the original value of `t`.
   - `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` using the original value of `t`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `t1` and `t2` are not explicitly initialized, so they must be set during the execution of the conditions.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The first condition checks if `t1 >= a`. Since `t1` is not explicitly initialized, it is likely that this condition will not be true initially.
   - The second condition checks if `t2 % 15 == 0`. Since `t2` is also not explicitly initialized, it is likely that this condition will not be true initially.
   - Therefore, the third condition (`t2 % 15 != 0`) will be the one that is evaluated.

3. **Third Condition**:
   - If `b` is even, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4` using the original value of `t`.
   - `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` using the original value of `t`.

### Final Value of `t`:
- Since `t2` is not explicitly initialized, we assume it is 0 for simplicity (as it is the most straightforward initial value).
- If `b` is even, `t` becomes `b // 2 + 0 // 15 + 1 = b // 2 + 1`.
- If `b` is odd, `t` becomes `b // 2 + 1 + 0 // 15 + 1 = b // 2 + 2`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `t` will be either `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 2` if `b` is odd.

### Output:
Output: **t (where t is b // 2 + 1 if b is even, or b // 2 + 2 if b is odd)**
