Output State: **`t` is `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer), `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.** 

Explanation:
- `t` is updated based on the condition: if `b` is even, `t` is `b // 2`; if `b` is odd, `t` is `(b // 2) + 1`.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
