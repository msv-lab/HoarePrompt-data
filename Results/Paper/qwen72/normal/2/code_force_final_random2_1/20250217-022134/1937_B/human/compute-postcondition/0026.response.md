Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', `s` is the concatenation of the first 5 characters from `a[0]` and the substring from index 4 onwards from `a[1]`, `x` is 4, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged.***
