#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n} and a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n} are binary strings of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The loop has executed exactly 2 times, and `a` is a list containing two input strings.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` remains a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenated string formed by the condition being met (if it was met) or the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n-1`, `i` is `n-2`, and `n` is the total number of iterations plus 2 (since the loop starts after the initial 2 executions).
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenated string formed by the condition being met (if it was met) or the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n-1`, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is the total number of iterations plus 2, and `t` is 1 or the value calculated when the condition was met.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is either the concatenated string formed by the condition being met or the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1])
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is 1 if the condition was never met, or the value calculated when the condition was met)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It then processes these strings to find a specific pattern: if the second string has a '0' at position `i` and the first string has a '1' at position `i+1`, it forms a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the first string up to position `i+1` with the suffix of the second string starting from position `i`. If no such pattern is found, `s` is set to the first string concatenated with the last character of the second string. Additionally, it calculates a value `t` which is either 1 or a specific index-based calculation if the pattern was found. Finally, the function prints the string `s` and the value `t`.
