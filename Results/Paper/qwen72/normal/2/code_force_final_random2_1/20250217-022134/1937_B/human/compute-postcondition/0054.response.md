Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it reads the input, analyzes the grid formed by the two binary strings, and prints a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The string `s` is derived by potentially concatenating parts of the input strings based on certain conditions. The integer `t` represents a calculated value based on the positions where specific patterns are found in the grid. The function handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5. **
