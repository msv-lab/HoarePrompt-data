t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n} and a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n} are binary strings of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
