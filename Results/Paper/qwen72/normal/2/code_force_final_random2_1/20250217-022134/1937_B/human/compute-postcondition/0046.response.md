Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It then processes these strings to find a specific pattern: if the second string has a '0' at position `i` and the first string has a '1' at position `i+1`, it forms a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the first string up to position `i+1` with the suffix of the second string starting from position `i`. If no such pattern is found, `s` is set to the first string concatenated with the last character of the second string. Additionally, it calculates a value `t` which is either 1 or a specific index-based calculation if the pattern was found. Finally, the function prints the string `s` and the value `t`. **
