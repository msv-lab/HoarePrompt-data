Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `sz`, `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The specific conditions and relationships between the variables, such as `t` being greater than 0, `tc` being 0, `n` being an input integer, `a` being a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` being the maximum value in `a`, and `sz` being the next element in `a`, are still valid.
