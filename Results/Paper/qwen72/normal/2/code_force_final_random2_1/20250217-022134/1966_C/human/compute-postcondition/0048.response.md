The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is updated with the new input values. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize`) remain unchanged, but their values may now depend on the new list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the new input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the new list `a`.**
