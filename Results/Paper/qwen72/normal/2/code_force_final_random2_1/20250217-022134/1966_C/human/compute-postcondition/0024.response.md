The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `tc` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `tc`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
