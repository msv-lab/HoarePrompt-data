The code snippet `mexsize = mexsize + 1` increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Given the initial state, `mexsize` was initially 1, and if `sz` (the second element of `a`) is equal to 1, `mexsize` would have been updated to 2. However, regardless of the initial value of `mexsize`, the code will increment it by 1.

Therefore, the updated value of `mexsize` will be:

- If `sz` was not equal to 1, `mexsize` was initially 1, and after the increment, it will be 2.
- If `sz` was equal to 1, `mexsize` was initially 2, and after the increment, it will be 3.

The rest of the variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `sz`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 2 if `sz` is not equal to 1, otherwise `mexsize` is 3, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`.**
