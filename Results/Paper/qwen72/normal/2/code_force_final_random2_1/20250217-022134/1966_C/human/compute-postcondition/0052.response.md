To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the variable `sz` and the list `a`.

1. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
2. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`
- `mexsize` is 1

The only state that directly affects the loop's ability to execute is the list `a`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`**
