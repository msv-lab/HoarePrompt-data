Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` (if `a` is non-empty). If `a` is empty, `maxsize` and `mexsize` are undefined.**

Explanation: The code snippet `maxsize = max(a)` updates the value of `maxsize` to be the maximum value in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. If `a` is empty, `maxsize` remains undefined, and `mexsize` also remains undefined. If `a` is non-empty, `maxsize` is now the maximum value in `a`, and `mexsize` remains the smallest positive integer not present in `a`.
