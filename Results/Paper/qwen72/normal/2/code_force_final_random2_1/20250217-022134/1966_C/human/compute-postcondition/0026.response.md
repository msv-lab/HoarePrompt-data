The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`
- If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` remain unchanged, but their relationships to `a` may no longer be valid since `a` has been reassigned.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a` (if `a` is non-empty), `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` (if `a` is non-empty). If `a` is empty, `maxsize` and `mexsize` are undefined.**
