Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `mexsize` to 1, overriding its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, and `maxsize` are still valid.
