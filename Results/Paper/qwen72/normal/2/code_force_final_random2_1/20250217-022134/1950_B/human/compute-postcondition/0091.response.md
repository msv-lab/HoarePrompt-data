The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer ranging from 1 to 20, and for each test case, `n` is also an integer ranging from 1 to 20. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine what it returns without additional context.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates under the constraints that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided.**
