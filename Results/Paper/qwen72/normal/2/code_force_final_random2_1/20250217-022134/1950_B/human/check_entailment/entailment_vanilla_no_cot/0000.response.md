Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all possible values of \( n \) within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The program only explicitly handles the cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \), and prints a message "No esta en el rango" for any other value of \( n \). This is incorrect because the problem requires generating a checkerboard for any \( n \) within the range, not just the first four values.

Additionally, the program does not follow the requirement to output the checkerboard for multiple test cases without empty lines between them. The program should be able to generate the checkerboard pattern dynamically for any valid \( n \) and handle multiple test cases as specified in the input format.

A correct solution would involve a more general approach to generate the checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) within the specified range. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for _ in range(casos):
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(2 * n):
            line = ''
            for j in range(2 * n):
                if (i // 2 + j // 2) % 2 == 0:
                    line += '#'
                else:
                    line += '.'
            print(line)
```

This function correctly generates the checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) within the specified range and handles multiple test cases as required.
