The function `func` reads an integer `casos` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ casos ≤ 20`. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`) and prints a pattern of `#` and `.` characters based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 grid of `##`. If `n` is 2, it prints a 4x4 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is 3, it prints a 6x6 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is 4, it prints an 8x8 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `casos` remains unchanged, and `n` retains its last input value for each test case.
