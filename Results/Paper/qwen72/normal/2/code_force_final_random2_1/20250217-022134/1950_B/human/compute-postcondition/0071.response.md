The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is: `print('##..##')`.
2. This statement prints the string `'##..##'`.
3. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **##..##**
