Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `casos` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which must be within the range 1 to 20. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
