The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string literal `'..##..'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`.

Output: **..##..**
