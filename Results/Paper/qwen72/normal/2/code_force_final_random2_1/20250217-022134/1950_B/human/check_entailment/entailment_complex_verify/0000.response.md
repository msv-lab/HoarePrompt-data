Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program. The program is designed to handle only specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and fails to generate the correct checkerboard pattern for any other value of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). According to the problem description, the program should be able to handle any valid `n` and produce the corresponding checkerboard pattern. The current implementation does not meet this requirement, as it prints "No esta en el rango" for any `n` outside the explicitly handled cases. This behavior is incorrect and violates the problem specification.

Final: **False**
