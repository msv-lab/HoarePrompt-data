Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle up to 20 test cases (`1 ≤ t ≤ 20`), and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 20`) and prints a checkerboard pattern of size `2n x 2n` using `#` and `.` characters. However, the implementation has a significant limitation: it only handles specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4) explicitly and prints a hardcoded pattern for these values. For any other value of `n` (i.e., `n > 4`), it prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This behavior is incorrect because the problem statement requires the program to handle any `n` within the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`.

Additionally, the program does not generate the checkerboard pattern dynamically, which is necessary to handle all possible values of `n` within the specified range. The hardcoded patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` are correct, but the program fails to generalize beyond these specific cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
