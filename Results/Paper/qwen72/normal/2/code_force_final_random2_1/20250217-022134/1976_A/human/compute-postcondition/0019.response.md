The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `len(digits)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `digits` list. If the `digits` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order. For the loop to execute, `digits` must have at least one element, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
