Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed fails to correctly handle the case where a digit comes after a letter. The specific issue lies in the logic used to enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter. The condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is not sufficient because it only checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, rather than ensuring that no digit appears after a letter in the sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to maintain a flag to track whether a digit has been encountered and ensure that no letters appear after the first digit. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    seen_digit = False
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
            seen_digit = True
        elif char.isalpha():
            if seen_digit:
                return False  # A letter appears after a digit
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if the sorted concatenation matches the original password
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify cases where a digit appears after a letter and return `False` for such cases.

Final: **False**
