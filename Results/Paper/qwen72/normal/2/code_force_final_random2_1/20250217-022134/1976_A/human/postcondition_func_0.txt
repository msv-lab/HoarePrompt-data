The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `password`, which is a string of length 1 to 20 characters, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the digits and letters from the `password` into two lists, sorts both lists in ascending order, and then concatenates them back into a single string. The function returns `True` if the concatenated string matches the original `password` and all digits in the `password` are in non-decreasing order, and no digit is greater than any letter in the `password`. In all other cases, the function returns `False`.
