### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - It also correctly reads the length of the password and the password itself for each test case.

2. **Character Classification**:
   - The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done using a loop that checks if each character is a digit or a letter.

3. **Sorting and Validation**:
   - The program sorts both the `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - It then checks if the sorted `digits` list is in non-decreasing order. If any digit is greater than the next digit, it returns `False`.
   - It also checks if any digit in the `digits` list is greater than any letter in the `letters` list. If so, it returns `False`.

4. **Final Password Check**:
   - The program combines the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and joins them into a single string.
   - It then compares this sorted string with the original password. If they are equal, the password is considered strong, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles passwords with only digits or only letters correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees at least one character).

### Issues:
- **Redundant Sorting**: The program sorts the `digits` and `letters` lists twice. Once during the initial separation and again when checking the order. This is unnecessary and can be optimized.
- **Incorrect Comparison**: The comparison `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect. It should check if any digit is followed by a letter, which is not the same as comparing the last digit with each letter.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits are in non-decreasing order
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters are in non-decreasing order
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if any digit is followed by a letter
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit() and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issues with redundant sorting and incorrect comparisons.
- The proposed corrected function addresses these issues and ensures the password meets all the specified conditions.

### Final Answer:
The original program has issues with redundant sorting and incorrect comparisons, leading to potential false negatives. The corrected function addresses these issues and ensures the password meets all the specified conditions.

Final: **False**
