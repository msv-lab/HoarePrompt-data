Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order, `letters` list contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in sorted ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(digits)):
    if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
        return False
    if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
        return False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is not greater than `letters[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is not greater than `letters[i]`. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the program returns False. If `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the program returns False. If neither of these conditions is met, the program continues execution without returning False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
