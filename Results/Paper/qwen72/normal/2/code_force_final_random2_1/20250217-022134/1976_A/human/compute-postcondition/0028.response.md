Postcondition: ***`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is not greater than `letters[i]`. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning False.***
