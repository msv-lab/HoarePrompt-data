Postcondition: ***`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the program returns False. If neither of these conditions is met, the program continues execution without returning False.***
