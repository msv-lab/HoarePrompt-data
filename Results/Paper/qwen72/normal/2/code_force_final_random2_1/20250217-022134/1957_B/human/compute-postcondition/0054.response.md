Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2 or 1, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is now 4 if `temp` was 2, or `temp` is now 2 if `temp` was 1. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 2 and `temp` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `temp` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
