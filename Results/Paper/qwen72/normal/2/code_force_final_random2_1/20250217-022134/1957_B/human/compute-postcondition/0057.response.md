Given the `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that need to be checked or modified for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement within the loop body that is triggered based on certain conditions.

Since the loop is a `while True:` loop, it will always execute the next iteration unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 2 or 1. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 4 if `temp` was 2, or `temp` is 2 if `temp` was 1. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
