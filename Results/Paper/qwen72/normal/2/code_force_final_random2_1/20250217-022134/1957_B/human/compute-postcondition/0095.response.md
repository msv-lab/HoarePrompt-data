The code snippet `ans.append((1 << i) - 1)` appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Here, `1 << i` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` positions, effectively calculating \(2^i\). Subtracting 1 from this value gives \(2^i - 1\).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of strings
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`
- `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`

After executing the code snippet:
- The value \((1 << i) - 1\) is appended to the list `ans`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of strings
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`
- `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`
- `ans` is a list containing the value \((1 << i) - 1\)
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`, `ans` is a list containing the value \((1 << i) - 1\), `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.**
