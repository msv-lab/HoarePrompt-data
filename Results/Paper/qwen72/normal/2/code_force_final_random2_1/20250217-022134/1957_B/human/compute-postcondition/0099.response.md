Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`, `ans` is a list containing \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.***
