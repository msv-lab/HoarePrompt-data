Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` was no longer less than `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.

Code:
```
l1 = input().split()
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. `l1` is updated to the list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces.
2. `n` is updated to the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
3. `k` is updated to the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
4. If `n` == 1, no further changes are made to any variables.
5. If `n` != 1:
   - `arr` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `k0` is set to the integer value of the second element in `l1` (which is the same as `k`).
   - `temp` is initialized to 1.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `temp` is doubled until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`, and `i` is incremented each time `temp` is doubled.
   - `ans` is set to a list containing `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros.

Output State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` was no longer less than `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.**
