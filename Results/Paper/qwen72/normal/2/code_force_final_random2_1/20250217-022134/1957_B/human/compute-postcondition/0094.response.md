Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to double `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.
- Each time `temp` is doubled, `i` is incremented by 1.
- When the loop exits, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- The variable `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
