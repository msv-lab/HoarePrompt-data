To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions and variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

This loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. The loop will run as many times as the integer value provided by the user input.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable. However, the key factor determining whether the loop will execute is the result of `int(input())`.
2. **User Input**: The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer. If it returns 0 or a negative integer, the loop will not execute.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state provided is:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.

### Adjusting the State:
- To ensure the loop executes, the user input must be a positive integer.
- The loop variable `_` is not relevant to the initial state and does not need adjustment.

### Final State:
The loop will execute if the user input is a positive integer. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the user input for the loop must be a positive integer.**
