The code `l1 = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `l1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from user input.**
