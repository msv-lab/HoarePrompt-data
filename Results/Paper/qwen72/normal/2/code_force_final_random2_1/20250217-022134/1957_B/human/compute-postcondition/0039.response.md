Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of strings.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the integer value of the second element in the list `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element in the list l1)**
