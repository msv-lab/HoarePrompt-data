The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` converts the first and second elements of the list `l1` to integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold these integer values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.**
