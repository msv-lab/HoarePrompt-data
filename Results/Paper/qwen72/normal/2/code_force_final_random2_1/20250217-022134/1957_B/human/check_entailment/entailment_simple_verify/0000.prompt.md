You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, if `n` was 1, no changes were made to `n`, `k`, or any other variables. If `n` was not 1, `arr` remains an empty list, `k0` retains the original value of `k`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), `ans` contains the values \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`. The loop has printed the list `ans` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. According to the problem description, the sum of the sequence must equal `k`, and the sequence must contain exactly `n` elements. If `k` is less than `n`, it is impossible to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` without including negative numbers or violating the condition that all elements are non-negative.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 5 3
```
Here, `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The program will attempt to construct a sequence of 5 non-negative integers that sum to 3. However, the only way to do this is to have three 1s and two 0s, but the program does not handle this case correctly. It will output a sequence that does not meet the requirements, such as:
```
7 0 0 0 0
```
This sequence sums to 7, not 3, and thus fails to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
