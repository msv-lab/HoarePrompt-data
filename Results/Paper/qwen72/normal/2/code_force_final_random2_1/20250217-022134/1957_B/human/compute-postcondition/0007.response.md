Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list `arr`, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
