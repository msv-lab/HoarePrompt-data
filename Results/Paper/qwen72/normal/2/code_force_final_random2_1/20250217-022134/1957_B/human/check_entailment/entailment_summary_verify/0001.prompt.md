You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints the integer `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, where the first two elements are calculated based on the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and the remaining elements are zeros. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `n == 1`, the function directly prints `k` because the only way to satisfy the condition with a single number is to use `k` itself.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence of numbers.
   - It also initializes `temp` to 1 and iterates to find the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - The loop continues until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`, at which point it breaks.
   - The function appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`, which is a number with the first `i` bits set to 1. This ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s.
   - It then appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends `0` to `ans` until the length of `ans` is `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Analysis:
- **Sum Condition:**
  - The sum of the elements in `ans` is correctly calculated to be `k`. The first element is `(1 << i) - 1`, and the second element is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, ensuring the sum is `k`.
- **Bitwise OR Condition:**
  - The first element `(1 << i) - 1` has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation for the given `k`. The second element is chosen to make the sum equal to `k`, and the rest are zeros, which do not affect the bitwise OR result.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case when `n == 1` correctly.
  - For other values of `n`, it ensures that the sequence has the required properties.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
